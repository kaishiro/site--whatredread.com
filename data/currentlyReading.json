The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next.
