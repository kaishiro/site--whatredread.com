Grief-stricken over the death of her mother and the impending death of her father, Desiree Stone has been missing for three weeks. So has the first investigator Stone hired to find her: Jay Becker, Patrick's mentor.<br><br>Patrick and Angie are led down a trail of half-truths and corruption into a world in which a therapeutic organization may be fronting for a dangerous and seductive cult, a high-tech private investigation firm may be covering up lethal crimes, and a stolen cache of millions in illegal funds may be tied to both disappearances and a tanker full of heroin. Nothing is what it seems as the detectives travel from the windblown streets of Boston to the rum-punch sunsets of Florida's Gulf Coast. And the more Patrick and Angie discover, the more they realize that on this case any wrong step will certainly be their last . . .<br><br>Snappy dialogue, explosive action scenes, and original characters have become Dennis Lehane's trademarks. With <em>Sacred,</em> Lehane confirms his status as today's hottest young author of first-rate mysteries that are also smartly written literary novels.","authors":{"author":{"id":"10289","name":"Dennis Lehane","image_url":"http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1227580381p5/10289.jpg","small_image_url":"http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1227580381p2/10289.jpg","link":"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10289.Dennis_Lehane","average_rating":"4.02","ratings_count":"219764","text_reviews_count":"15791"}},"published":"2009"},"rating":"0","votes":"0","spoiler_flag":"false","spoilers_state":"none","shelves":{"shelf":{"name":"currently-reading"}},"recommended_for":null,"recommended_by":null,"started_at":"Mon Mar 31 18:45:40 -0700 2014","read_at":null,"date_added":"Fri Dec 27 07:05:26 -0800 2013","date_updated":"Tue Apr 01 07:09:28 -0700 2014","read_count":null,"body":"\n      \n  ","comments_count":"review_comments_count","url":"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/801378182","link":"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/801378182","owned":"0"},{"id":"579056374","book":{"id":15769885,"isbn":null,"isbn13":null,"text_reviews_count":2,"title":"Seed to Harvest","image_url":"http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1343239263m/15769885.jpg","small_image_url":"http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1343239263s/15769885.jpg","link":"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15769885-seed-to-harvest","num_pages":"788","format":"Kindle Edition","edition_information":null,"publisher":"Open Road","publication_day":"24","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"4.28","ratings_count":"1236","description":null,"authors":{"author":{"id":"29535","name":"Octavia E.
