I went with writing about books because it's the topic I am most likely to accost a stranger about, so I figured why not bother lots of strangers simultaneously here. I read primarily contemporary fiction, usually of the dark humor sort, but I'm willing to dabble in most genres.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-11T16:54:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-23T02:53:50+00:00","published_at":"2014-03-11T16:54:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":null,"meta":[]}
