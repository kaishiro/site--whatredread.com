We are finished with Bleak House. All bajillion pages. Thank you Alice for hosting\r\n\r\n![bleak house1-6](/assets/bleak house1-6.jpg) \r\n\r\nNow we have the last chapters. Let's see how everything resolved\r\n\r\nBucket is now racing to find where Lady D has run off to because Sir Leicester is amazing and wants her back and doesn't care about her past and is the sweetest person ever and I feel bad for all the times I thought mean things about his gout.\r\n\r\nBucket continues to be super nice and friendly while trying to find information, while at the same time getting back to the carriage with Esther and completely dropping the friendliness (not that he's being mean to Esther, just he's not as jolly as he was a moment ago) and this is not winning me over in terms of thinking Bucket is not faking friendship with other people he's nice to. Cos it seems this is something he's able to turn on and off really easily. And YES maybe he's just really friendly and he can keep these things separate and he's very sincere in his friendship. Or not. I can't tell.\r\n\r\nAaaaand Lady D is dead. Well. Huh. I did not expect that. And she died not knowing that Sir Leicester is awesome and had already forgiven her and just wanted her home and safe. Damn. And now he's had a heart attack or a stroke or something.\r\n\r\n![parks5](/assets/parks5.gif) \r\n\r\nDickens is a jerk.\r\n\r\nBUT this is not the end of the story, even if it is the end of the most interesting storyline.\r\n\r\nRichard continues to be a Dick-chard and is getting sicker and sicker so Esther is always hanging out with Ada, as things should be. Ada married Richard thinking she could change him and yeah, that's working out great for her. Also she's pregnant and hoping the baby will help make things better with Richard. Again, that always works out so well.\r\n\r\nSkimpole calls Jarndyce selfish in his memoirs or whatever.\r\n\r\n![LLlastnerve-1](/assets/LLlastnerve-1.gif) \r\n\r\nSkimpole is the worst. But now he's dead. Without ever learning a lesson about his behavior or anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nGeorge and his brother reconcile and George becomes friends with Sir Leicester and takes care of him and that's nice of him. So he got a happy ending.\r\n\r\nJarndyce pretends to plan his marriage to Esther just to mess with her cos HAHA he knew she loved Woodcourt, which is why he had Woodcourt's mom move in with them for a while. Jarndyce is so sweet. Even if that was sort of a mean trick and can't you just give Esther what she wants without playing an elaborate trick on her? No, instead we have to make her cry and cry and try to convince herself they're tears of happiness. Great. But now Woodcourt and Esther is engaged.\r\n\r\nIn what is probably my favorite scene in the book, Guppy shows up to say that even though Esther is all weird looking now he will totally still marry her, isn't he swell?\r\n\r\n![justkickit](/assets/justkickit.gif) \r\n\r\nSo then when Jarndyce turns down the engagement on Esther's behalf, Guppy's mom (who he TOTALLY BROUGHT ALONG) gets all angry and demands they get out. Except Guppy & co came to Jarndyce's house so instead Guppy and Jobling have to drag Mrs. Weevle out kicking and screaming.\r\n\r\nThe Jarndyce & Jarndyce case is over. I still have no idea what happened. But now it's done and the book's almost over so I guess that doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nAnd then Richard dies and I should probably feel bad for him, but not happening.\r\n\r\n![dontcare-1](/assets/dontcare-1.gif) \r\n\r\nAda and her son move back in with Jarndyce, which I guess is nice except she's obviously supposed to move in with Esther and Woodcourt so way to screw that up, Dickens. But Esther is happy so I guess it's a happy ending.\r\n\r\nOh, and there's a line about Ada's son having two moms. Because of Esther. So. Are there seriously people that argue Esther and Ada aren't in love? Because how?\r\n\r\nHere's the thing. We have now finished Bleak House. And I've read A Christmas Carol and Great Expectations a bunch of times (because various classes made me) and I've come to the conclusion that Dickens\r\n\r\n![notmyjam](/assets/notmyjam.gif) \r\n\r\nSorry Alice. I thought if anything would make me appreciate the guy it would be one of our readalongs. And I still stand by that. Cos if this didn't do it, there's little hope. I like the idea of Dickens but actually getting into the weeds of his stories I mostly just...don't care. \r\n\r\nBUT I still had a good time doing this readalong with everyone, as expected. And now I can say I've read this one so, points.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:37:46+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:37:46+00:00","published_at":"2014-03-18T13:36:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de68a5dde2289f60000ad","key":"books","value":"31242"},{"id":"532de68a5dde2289f60000ae","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from location 14553 | Dickens, Charles.

It is a horror story and it is scary, those are things thought I knew about it going in and those things remained true to the end. But I had to change that initial thought to \"Wow, this is a really good story.\"\r\n\r\n![NOS4A2_cover](/assets/NOS4A2_cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nNOS4A2 is sort of a strange story to explain, but I'll do my best.\r\n\r\nVic McQueen can find things. As a small child she learns that she can ride her bike across this rickety covered bridge and find something that's missing: her mother's bracelet, a photograph, whatever needs found. The bridge will take her to where the item is, no matter how far away. Of course, trips across the bridge take their toll, so Vic can't make too many trips.\r\n\r\nCharles Manx has his own special vehicle, an old Rolls Royce Wraith. He doesn't use his car to find things though. Instead his car can take him and the children he's rescuing to Christmasland, where children are always happy and every day is Christmas day. Which might seem sweet. He certainly thinks he's doing a good job. But of course his wife used to call him Nosferatu so often he made it his license plate. As a joke, of course...\r\n\r\nManx is terrifying. One of the best villains I can remember reading. He seems to think he's doing something good. Maybe not entirely good, but I think he might believe he is helping these kids. And of course, if they help him all the better, right? I'm also pretty sure that Joe Hill spent a lot of time reading MRA websites to get some of the Manx character.\r\n\r\nIt's not just the villain that make the book. Vic McQueen is a great character. She's strong, she's flawed, she's hurt, she's determined. I loved her. It's hard to get too much into all the great things about Vic without getting too much into the story and spoilers, but all of the those adjectives I said above. That.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't want to get into spoilers, but know that I loved a lot of the secondary characters as well. Once that I really thought would be a quick throwaway character and sure, they didn't all have a ton of scenes, but Hill managed to make them feel like full characters. Full sympathetic characters. With some great lines about librarians.\r\nNo one looks too closely at a librarian. People are afraid of going blind from the glare of ssss-ssso much compressed wisdom.\r\n\r\nI didn't expect the book to be as good as it was. I mean, I didn't expect it to be bad or anything. I liked Horns so I had an idea of what Hill's style is, but I didn't expect this. I hated whenever I had to put the book down, even though the book is seriously creepy and it was probably for the best I didn't read this all in one sitting or anything crazy like that.\r\n\r\nThis book was excellent. I want to say everyone should read it but then there's the horror bit and I know some people aren't into that. So just know that you should still read the book, but be prepared for a seriously creepy story. If I get a phone call from any young children, I'll probably freak out.\r\n\r\nOh, and I would like to say thank you to Tabitha King who, according to the acknowledgements, convinced Hill to change the ending. I was worried about how the ending was going to go but it was all good by the last page.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:34:14+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-23T01:55:56+00:00","published_at":"2014-03-17T14:34:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de5b65dde22aa760001f0","key":"books","value":"15729539"},{"id":"532de5b65dde22aa760001f1","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 380, location 5191 | Hill, Joe.

She figured I do this book blog thing so I probably have some ideas. And I did!\r\n\r\n![aggressivelyhelpful](/assets/aggressivelyhelpful.gif) \r\n\r\nWhile I think it can be stressful to buy books for people (I don't want them to feel like they HAVE to like the book) I like giving recommendations cos hey, it's up to them if they take the recommendation or not. So I thought about some of the books I'd recently read and liked and picked out which of those I thought my friend would be into.\r\n\r\nMy book recommendations to her were a success! (obviously). She's getting her PhD in Reading and Literacy but life has a sense of humor so OF COURSE she has barely any time for reading. Because of this she doesn't want to waste time with subpar books and asked for some more recommendations.\r\n\r\nI figured I could hive-mind this and ask everyone to help with some recommendations. PLUS this means I can continue to put off my review of NOS4A2 which I VERY MUCH ENJOYED but am being lazy about writing the review itself. It's always hard to write about books I loved.\r\n\r\nSO, help me with some book recommendations. As I mentioned, my friend is working on her PhD, so she's super smart. She, another friend of ours, and I tried to start a book club when we all lived up in Boston. We succeeded in starting a \"drink wine\" club, so still a win. She's a fan of Jhumpa Lahiri, Khaled Hosseini, and The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. She also likes YA lit except I am not so good for those recommendations so I definitely need help with those. She is also the friend that finally made me read the Harry Potter series, so I sort of owe her when it comes to book recommendations. I told her to read Orange is the New Black, Where'd You Go, Bernadette?, and Let's Pretend This Never Happened and that worked out, so let's see what else we can come up with.\r\n\r\n![anniegetsstuffdone-1](/assets/anniegetsstuffdone-1.gif) \r\n\r\nAttachments, Fangirl, and Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell because of course.\r\nThe Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion\r\nTell the Wolves I'm Home by Carol Rifka Brunt\r\nKindred by Octavia E.

Mysteries will be solved, jackasses better be punished (Skimpole...). Thank you Alice, for hosting this readalong and keeping us all motivated (and spreading the chapters out).\r\n\r\nBleak House chapters XLIX - LV (which I hope means 49-55).\r\n\r\n![bleak house1-5](/assets/bleak house1-5.jpg) \r\n\r\nWe ended the last section with Tulkinghorn getting shot. That was fun. So now we have to figure out who shot him.\r\n\r\nFirst suspect, apparently is George. George goes to a lovely birthday dinner at the Bagnets and then Bucket joins and is all nice and gets everyone to like him and then BAM, as soon as they leave the Bagnets' Buckets slaps the cuffs on George. At least he was nice enough to not ruin their lovely chicken dinner, which is apparently saved for very special occasions.\r\nIt is well for the old girl that she has but one birthday in a year, for two such indulgences in poultry might be injurious.\r\nI'm trying to think nice things about Bucket cos I know everyone liked him when he showed up before, but it's NOT WORKING when he pretends to be George's BFF just to arrest him.\r\n\r\n![ahyourface](/assets/ahyourface.gif) \r\n\r\nIt's cool though because Mrs. Bagnet is going to save George and I wish the story had focused more on them being adorable and kick ass.\r\n\r\nThere is a rift between Ada and Esther and DO NOT LIKE. Esther thinks it's because she told Ada about her engagement to Mr. Jarndyce but it turns out it's because Ada and Richard got secretly married and she doesn't want to get secrets from Esther. All I hear is \"We both are going to/have married people that aren't each other and thus the universe is sad.\"\r\n\r\n![pushingdaisesnotouch](/assets/pushingdaisesnotouch.gif) \r\n\r\nBucket goes to Sir Leicester's and lets himself in with his own key. They seem to give a lot of keys out to the house. We know Bucket is married, but given his conversation with the man-servant Mercury, we can guess that marriage is a sham right?\r\n\r\n> Mr. Bucket is presently standing before the hall-fire - bright and warm on the early winter night - admiring Mercury.\r\n\r\n> \"Why, you're six foot two, I suppose?\" says Mr. Bucket.\r\n\r\n> \"Three,\" says Mercury.\r\n\r\n> \"Are you so much? But then, you see, you're broad in proportion and don't look it. You're not one of the weak-legged ones, you ain't. Was you ever modelled now?\" Mr. Bucket asks, conveying the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head.\r\n\r\n> Mercury never was modelled.\r\n\r\n> \"Then you out to be, you know,\" says Mr. Bucket\r\n\r\n![notsexual](/assets/notsexual.gif) \r\n\r\nBucket is that creepy guy trolling malls telling girls he totally has an in with a modeling company.\r\n\r\nBucket tells Sir Leicester that he arrested George even though he knows it wasn't actually George that committed the crime (still not winning me over) and that it was actually a woman and then lots of people come in and they fill Leicester in that Lady Dedlock used to be Nemo/Captain Hawdon's lover and that Mrs. Chadband raised Lady D's daughter and Mrs. Snagsby complains that everyone is against her.\r\n\r\nThen we get another instance when Bucket pretends to be a super nice guy, this time to Hortense who he and his wife have taken in as a lodger, only to jump out and arrest HER. Of course Hortense was trying to frame Lady D so at least this time he got it right. Still though, you need to pretend to be friends with everyone before arresting them?\r\n\r\n![intoatrap](/assets/intoatrap.gif) \r\n\r\nAlso is anyone surprised Hortense was arrested? Or just surprised she didn't kill via stabbing?\r\n\r\nLady D finds out from Guppy that her secret is out so she decides to run away.\r\n\r\nWill Esther end up with Woodcourt? Is Jarndyce going to be heartbroken? Will Esther and Ada end up together, as they're clearly supposed to? Will Esther and Lady D reunite but for real this time?

Particularly ones that have been on my radar, but sort of the outskirts. I knew of it, but it wasn't something I was searching out.\r\n\r\n![Housekeeper and Professor cover](/assets/Housekeeper and Professor cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nThis is the story of, surprise, a professor and a housekeeper. And the housekeeper's son. There are a few other characters but they are not the focus. It's just these three.\r\n\r\nThe Professor was a math professor. He hasn't been a professor in a long time, not since he was in a car accident that robbed him of his memory. Now his memory only lasts 80 minutes. He mostly gets by using notes attached all over his suit with little reminders about his day, who people are, and of course of his condition.\r\n\r\nHis memory problem necessitates the Housekeeper. She does more than just clean the house. She's there all day long, cleaning, cooking, and running errands for the Professor. She's hired by the Professor's sister-in-law. He lives in a cottage behind her main house, and tells the Housekeeper that she does not  want to be disturbed by any problems. If there is an issue with the Professor she would like the Housekeeper to work it out on her own.\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor learns the Housekeeper has a young son that spends his afternoons at home alone while she's working, he insists the boy come to his house until it's time for the Housekeeper to go home, because a child should be with his mother. And so the Housekeeper's son Root becomes a fixture at the house and a favorite of the Professor.\r\n\r\nThere isn't too much of a plot here, but that doesn't mean this was a slow book. I finished it in a day (half on my morning commute, half in the evening). I loved watching the characters interact. And while math is far from a favorite subject of mine, the Professor's enthusiasm and joy for numbers almost makes me want to learn more math. I liked the conversation between the Professor and the Housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"The person who discovered amicable numbers must have been a genius.\"\r\n\"You might say that: it was Pythagoras, in the sixth century B.C.\"\r\n\"Did they have numbers that long ago?\"\r\n\"Of course! Did you think they were invented in the nineteenth century? There were numbers before human beings - before the world itself was formed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor is constantly working on complicated mathematical proofs and problems from various math journals and sending them away for prizes, although he really doesn't care about the prizes. He's happy to be solving the problems and he teaches the Housekeeper and Root the joy in finding these numerical connections and solving these mysteries.\r\n\r\nIt's a beautifully written story and I suppose some of that credit goes to Stephen Snyder for his translation from the original Japanese.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking fora  quiet and quick read, I would recommend this one. And I promise, a love of math is not necessary to enjoy.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:26:10+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:26:10+00:00","published_at":"2014-03-06T14:09:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de3d25dde2289f60000a3","key":"books","value":"3181564"},{"id":"532de3d25dde2289f60000a4","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 16 | Ogawa, Yoko.

Except this time I'm writing it Monday night because I forgot to write it this weekend. This also means additional time has passed between my reading and writing this, so this might make even less sense than the other posts. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nANYWAY, thank you Alice for hosting this because despite my inability to plan for things if my weekly schedule is disturbed in the slightest.\r\n\r\n![bleak house1-4](/assets/bleak house1-4.jpg) \r\n\r\nBleak House chapters XL through XLVIII (we're now at the point with Roman numerals where I have no idea what the chapter numbers are).\r\n\r\nTulkinghorn is being an asshole. But at this point I can just say \"Tulkinghorn is\" because the rest is repetitive. He tells Sir Leister a TOTALLY HYPOTHETICAL story about some aristocratic lady who was once engaged to some captain guy and got pregnant but the guy died before they could rush a wedding and she had a child out of wedlock. The lady managed to keep shame a secret until she made a stupid mistake and then EVERYONE HATED HER. Then he looks knowingly at Lady D, cos again, asshole.\r\n\r\nLady D confronts him up in his turret lair, and says she's ready to leave so she doesn't bring shame on her husband. Tulkinghorn convinces her not to and says he'll give her some warning before he reveals her secret and ruins her life.\r\n\r\n![Magnuseenfacelick](/assets/Magnuseenfacelick.gif) \r\n\r\nHortense comes back and is really the crazy is going to bubble over soon. She wants to help Tulkinghorn destroy Lady D. Tulkinghorn doesn't want to work with her, I have to assume in part because of the crazy.\r\n\r\nWe get to see Chez Skimpole and he continues to be a terrible terrible person. I guess if we're looking for good things to say about him, his daughters like him. Of course he sort of treats them like dolls so bad in the negative column. His house is falling apart, probably because he's such a child and THIS SHIT ISN'T CUTE OR WHIMSICAL. Except no one seems to call him on it, except all of these poor shopkeepers he keeps ripping off.\r\n\r\n![tfeyihateyou](/assets/tfeyihateyou.gif) \r\n\r\nSir Leicester shows up to tell Mr. Jarndyce, Esther, and Ada that he's sorry he hates their friend Boythorn so much but that they are ABSOLUTELY welcome to come visit, and Lady D even likes Mr. Jarndyce. Of course he also tells Skimpole he can come visit and I feel like that is bringing and expensive curse over to Chesney Wold but since I don't care so much about Leicester, that's fine.\r\n\r\nWe get LOTS of revelations in this section. Esther tells Jarndyce her (and Lady D's) secret. And Jarndyce reveals that Lady D's sister (and Esther's fake Godmother) was Boythorn's old lov-ah and that after Lady D and Lady D-sis got in a fight she broke things of with Boythorn. THEN Jarndyce proposes to Esther (in a letter) and Esther says yes.\r\n\r\n![gregwhat](/assets/gregwhat.gif) \r\n\r\nThe proposal makes Esther cry and NOT happy tears, and she burns all of the flowers from Woodcourt because she won't need those anymore. Because love is dead. And she's also forgetting about Ada, her true love. I guess she figures she'll still get that. I mean, she's going in and stealing kisses from her while she sleeps.\r\n\r\nRichard is in all kinds of trouble and is looking haggard and has lots of debt cos he's all obsessed with the J&J case. I dunno, I sort of don't care about Richard anymore. Sorry, Rick. BUT while Esther is visiting Richard she sees Woodcourt and she doesn't know what to do with herself cos she wants to see him but she's ugly now (and also engaged to an old guy [Jarndyce is old, right?]). BUT she does go see him and Woodcourt says he'll watch out for Richard.\r\n\r\nJo comes back! Granted  the poor guy shows up again after being tackled by Woodcourt. And he's all sick and he says he was taken from Bleak House. When he's hiding a George's, George assumes it's Bucket that did it to bring Jo to Tulkinghorn for EVIL REASONS. Then because things weren't depressing enough in Jo's life, we see a touching moment between him and Snagsby and then Jo dies. Because of course he does. Dammit, Dickens.\r\n\r\n![needamoment-1](/assets/needamoment-1.gif) \r\n\r\nLady D dismisses Rosa and sends her with Mr. Rouncewell so she can be with Rouncewell's son and that was nice. Tulkinghorn makes it all about him and is all annoyed that this is going to raise suspicions and now says he WON'T warn her before he's going to ruin her life.\r\n\r\nBUT THEN the section ends with Tulkinghorn being shot.\r\n\r\n![sherlockbyebye](/assets/sherlockbyebye.gif) \r\n\r\nSo. Problem solved. BUT WHO IS THE SHOOTER? And does anyone have a death count for this book, cos I feel like it's pretty high.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:23:37+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:23:37+00:00","published_at":"2014-03-05T02:20:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de3395dde22aa760001e6","key":"books","value":"31242"},{"id":"532de3395dde22aa760001e7","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from location 11,189 | Dickens, Charles.

The fact that I've read over 75% of Bleak House this month BUT haven't finished it yet (thank you again, Alice, for spreading this readalong out a bit more) means a lot of the pages aren't getting counted.

A lot. So when Emily sent me an emailing saying she'd procured me a copy of Christopher Moore's latest book The Serpent of Venice AND got it signed for me, I may have done a stupid dance.  She's pretty awesome, if you hadn't already guessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been super excited for this book ever since Moore mentioned it while promoting his (at the time) latest book Sacre Bleu. Enough so when it was my turn to get my book signed and talk to him I mumbled some version of \"yeah yeah, this current book I'm holding in my hand sounds good and all, but please tell me more about this Serpent of Venice you have in the works.\" And once I spoke up enough for him to hear, he was very nice and talked about how he had planned to write a bunch of it in iambic pentameter but do you know how hard that shit is? Very, is the answer. \r\n\r\nSerpent is the sequel to Fool which is one of my most favorite Moore books`1`. Fool is, essentially, King Lear but told from the Fool's point of view, with a little Macbeth thrown in. Serpent takes Pocket (aka the Fool) and sends him to Venice in a story that is basically a mash-up of The Merchant of Venice and Othello: The Moore of Venice, with a dash of Poe's \"The Count of Amontillado\". Now King Lear is not my favorite Shakespeare play, despite the number of times I've been forced to read it,`2` but you know what I do love? Fool. And while Merchant is also not a favorite of mine, Othello is, so the fact that Serpent is both is just peachy.\r\n\r\nAntonio, Brabantio, and Iago decide they need to get rid of the fool Pocket who seems to know too much and of course is just kind of annoying. Of course Pocket hasn't made it so long without a few attempts on his life, so he's pretty good at getting out of tight spots. Not to give too much away, but Pocket ends up on the doorstep of Shylock and his daughter Jessica, ready to begin his plan for revenge.\r\n\r\nOf course we have all of the elements of Merchant: the loan, the pound of flesh, Jessica running off with Shylock's jewels and turquoise ring to be with Antonio's buddy Lorenzo, Portia and her 3 caskets, \"the quality of mercy\" speech and the courtroom. And then there are the elements of Othello: Desdemona marrying Othello, Iago's manipulation, the Egyptian handkerchief, Cassio the light-weight. But if you haven't guessed, since we have lots of plays smooshed together, that things don't go quite as Shakespeare wrote. It all works out beautifully. And hilariously. The scenes between Iago and the Chorus are some of the best. And an explanation for why Iago always seems to be talking to himself.\r\n\r\nI always find writing about books I loved to be so much harder than books I hated. Or even just sorta \"meh\"-ed. And I loved this one. I had to force myself to read my Bleak House chapters/homework because I knew this was waiting for me. I tried to spread out the reading a little bit over the weekend, knowing I had a couple long train rides. And I failed because I NEEDED TO KEEP READING. And in terms of \"escape books\" (as in \"books that let me forget I'm on a crowded subway\") this one is way up there. I would look up and suddenly realize I was almost at my stop.\r\n\r\nNow I really want to re(re)read Fool. And then probably re-read this one.\r\n\r\n`1` Other favorite Moore books, because this post doesn't have enough links yet, Lamb (my most favoritest of my favorite books) and A Dirty Job. \r\n\r\n`2` And which I can't help but think every time \"Dammit, Cordelia. You can't just placate your dad for 2 minutes and exaggerate your love for him the tiniest bit? No?

Thank you Alice for hosting and also for spreading out the reading some more because we're all whiners.\r\n\r\n![bleak house1-3](/assets/bleak house1-3.jpg) \r\n\r\nNow, to the random thoughts about chapters XXXIII - XXXIX\r\n\r\nGuppy's first name is William. Weevle/Jobling's first name is Tony. And they have an adorable \"And then Guppy said \"Who are YOU conspiring with?\" And then Jobling retorts \"Nuh huh!\" And then HE said \"well I won't take you to the spring fling*\" and then I said \"Well I'm going with Prince, so WHO CARES\" and then they broke up and it was on the quad and everyone saw.\r\n\r\nGeorge gave Tulkster the Hawdon handwriting sample because something debts for the Bagnets. I'm not entirely sure who the Bagnets are. I know they have hilariously named children and now I know they were in debt but aren't now because George made a minor deal with...not the devil but one of the lesser demons. Sorry, George. You seem very nice but your chapters are boring.\r\n\r\nEsther is all disfigured by smallpox (at least enough that Charley hid all of the mirrors) BUT not blind anymore so there's that. She then admits that she believes Woodcourt loves her (yeah, thanks for that, couldn't have guessed) but she's very happy that they didn't get engaged cos now she's all ugly and that would be unfair to him.\r\n\r\n![sherlockcries](/assets/sherlockcries.gif) \r\n\r\nI'd find this more tragic but now she can 100% go after Ada. Cos Ada won't care about any scarring. Because LOVE.\r\n\r\nAre there interpretations of Bleak House that don't talk about Esther being super in love with Ada? If so, how the hell do they argue that? I mean, other than badly.\r\n\r\n![trashfail](/assets/trashfail.gif) \r\n\r\nThe Lady D and Esther reunion was...anticlimactic. Dickens take 3 chapters to describe fog, but we get maybe 3 pages for the entire \"I'm your mother!\" \"Of course you are! I love you, mother!\" \"I love you too. But we may never speak again. I must be dead to you because of my reputation.\" \"Of course! Because I love you so much I shall keep your secret.\" \"OK. Bye then.\" \"Bye.\"\r\n\r\n![waitwhut-1](/assets/waitwhut-1.gif) \r\n\r\nWhat the hell? He describes them as sobbing and hugging each other and kissing and it seems emotional except the whole thing happens in a heartbeat and why did we speed right through that scene?\r\n\r\nRichard is being a jerk now, all wrapped up in the Jarndyce case. And yet I still didn't really mind him, until it was revealed he's been hanging out with Skimpole. No Richard. No. You've crossed the line now.\r\n\r\nGuppy agrees to quit digging into Esther's past in a scene that's sort of adorable when he keeps oscillating between talking to her and running back to the house. But then you remember the creepy stalking and go back to thinking he should just go away now.\r\n\r\nGrandfather Smallwood is digging through Krook's things, and Tulkinghorn is lurking in Nemo/Hawdon/Weevle's apartment making vague threats at Guppy. All this stuff about Tulkinghorn collecting secrets. He's Magnassen, right? I bet he's flicking faces too. The jerk.\r\n\r\n![magnussenknowingowning](/assets/magnussenknowingowning.gif) \r\n\r\nWhat will Tulkinghorn do with this information? Is he going to reveal Lady D's past? Or use the information to get something from her? What does he want? Is Richard going to keep being a dick (HA) about this J&J case? Will Esther and Ada finally just get together already omg??\r\n\r\n*Why yes, Mean Girls was on TV when I was taking some of my notes.\r\n\r\nAt least there's only one new character in this section\r\nMr. Vholes - Richard's lawyer to help with the J&J case. Vholes whines a lot about how he does everything for his daughters. Also is very respectable because he has bad digestion and apparently those go together.

Not that I was ever really on fire with these things. But while all of the big stuff is done, I feel like there will probably be more to say about the little details. At the same time, I don't want to talk about EVERYTHING here, lest there is nothing at the wedding itself that's a surprise for the few people I know IRL that also visit my blog.\r\n\r\nSo far I think the only things I really don't want to reveal here are my dress and my first dance song. The dress because I don't want BF+ to see it before the wedding day (though he's going to see it before the ceremony cos I want pics done first so I can enjoy more of this cocktail hour because mmmm food) and the first dance song because I enjoy people trying to guess it.\r\n\r\nWhat I will tell you is our guest book idea. At least the current one.\r\n\r\nSee, at first we wanted to do a photo booth. They're fun and I'd love to have pictures of each person/group of people. The plan was people get their photos taken in the booth, they keep one copy of the photo strip and they glue the other down in a book and then they'll sign around it. Fun, right? Here's the thing. Photobooths are kind of expensive. And the space we're in isn't massive. They said they've done photobooths in there and it's been fine, but I fear it's going to be this thing in the way of the dance floor. So we decided to scrap that idea.\r\n\r\nWe could just do a book, of course. But eh. Seems boring and like something I'd never look at again. And if I won't look at it again, why should I make people sign it?\r\n\r\nWe thought about one of those thumbprint canvas art dealies. I like the idea of having a piece of art to hang up. Of course the downside (or upside, I guess depending on your view) is people can't really write anything. The idea is guests leave their thumbprint and...that's it. I guess some I've seen have people sign their name but no messages. Which can be fine but if people WANT to write a message they sort of...can't. I haven't ruled this idea out entirely, but it's plan B at this point.\r\n\r\nPlan A is bookmarks. We'll print up blank bookmarks for guests to sign. This goes along with the (semi) bookish theme and more importantly, I get bookmarks. Which is actually why I thought of it. I was having trouble finding a bookmark, because I tend to leave them in books and can't always remember the last place I had it. I was likely also watching one of those TLC wedding shows and I thought I could just make everyone sign a bookmark and then I will be swimming in the things! BAM. Mom and I are looking for bookmark templates (which I'm pretty sure is just...a long rectangle? I don't know why bookmark templates are a thing) which we'll cut up. Now I need to think of somewhere for people to put the bookmarks once they've signed them. So they don't take them home. Which is FINE but sort of defeats the whole \"bookmark guest book\" idea. I'm thinking a shadowbox for people to put them in, but if anyone has any other ideas I AM OPEN TO THEM!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:13:26+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:13:26+00:00","published_at":"2014-02-23T15:10:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de0d65dde22aa760001d9","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532de0d65dde22aa760001da","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532de0d65dde22aa760001d8","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish decorations","slug":"bookish-decorations","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-decorations"},{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"532de0a45dde2289f6000098","title":"Why I LOVE being a *reader* and a *book blogger*","slug":"why-i-love-being-a-reader-and-a-book-blogger","url":"/articles/why-i-love-being-a-reader-and-a-book-blogger","body":"The Broke and the Bookish posted the Tuesday Top Ten prompt reasons I love being a blogger/reader. I didn't answer it cos I'm doing the Bleak House readalong, which also posts on Tuesdays. What, post 2 things in one day? You're cute. So yeah, I didn't join in (or know it was a thing until I saw other people posting about it) but I like the prompt. I meant to write my own post answering this prompt pretty much every day since then. Except I clearly didn't get around to it until now because lazy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, why I love being a blogger and reader. Let's do this\r\n\r\n![anniegetsstuffdone](/assets/anniegetsstuffdone.gif) \r\n\r\nNew worlds/new people - How else am I going to know what it's like to someone/something different without stories? Stories are the best way to experience life from another point of view, and for me I connect with books more than I do with TV shows or movies (not that I don't loooooove both of those other things).\r\n\r\nEscape - I know I've said this a jillion times, but I do most of my reading on public transportation. Public transportation I'd rather forget I was riding. Books are amazing for this. I can read and (mostly) forget about the crazy man yelling racist things and his invisible friend`1`.\r\n\r\nThere is always something else to read - I know there can't actually be infinite books out there, but it feels like it. I at least know I will never get to the point where there is NOTHING for me to read. Especially considering how often I re-read things.\r\n\r\nYou can major in it - Seriously, reading is my hobby but also what I literally went to school for. And it's a real major that almost every university has. It's like cheating at school. PLUS, I saved serious money on school books. One math text book: $360 (or something ridiculously high). Every book I had to buy for a every class in a semester: $100.\r\n\r\nConnecting with people - I LOVE all of the people I have met through blogging about books. It is such a welcoming community, the people are awesome, and have been introduced to so many new favorite books. And now I can bore the people I see IRL less often about book things.\r\n\r\nReadalongs - It's like a book club ONLY BETTER. Rather than discuss the book at the end you're talking about it as your making your way through. And the gifs. OH the gifs.\r\n\r\nMy space - I love having this space, to write about something important to me and to keep track of all of the books I've read and to see how many opinions change. I'd have vague remembrances of a book I'd read, but a lot of them would be mostly forgotten. Not now! And while this is all through a bookish lens, I can track important things that have happened to me. I've moved (I believe 4 times), bought a house, got engaged, and will soon get married, all since starting this blog.\r\n\r\nI'm blanking on other reasons, though I'm sure there are more. Because really, I love love love reading and blogging about reading. I can't stress that enough. And with that, I'm off.\r\n\r\n![kittyrunaway](/assets/kittyrunaway.gif) \r\n\r\n`1` I tweeted the highlights, so you really, you should probably be following me there.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:12:36+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:12:36+00:00","published_at":"2014-02-21T13:41:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de0a45dde2289f600009a","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532de0a45dde2289f600009b","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532de0a45dde2289f6000099","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"532de01e5dde22143d000373","title":"My Lady, whose *chronic malady* of boredom has been *sadly aggravated* by Volumnia this evening","slug":"my-lady-whose-chronic-malady-of-boredom-has-been-sadly-aggravated-by-volumnia-this-evening","url":"/articles/my-lady-whose-chronic-malady-of-boredom-has-been-sadly-aggravated-by-volumnia-this-evening","body":"Another Tuesday, another Bleak House post.

Anyway, they show him some lady and ask if this is the person who asked Jo all about the dead guy and he says the person is dressed the same but the hand and voice aren't the same so they figure out it was Lady D asking Jo all these questions about Nemo while dressed as Hortense. DUN DUN DUUUUUN\r\n\r\n![howthisturnsout](/assets/howthisturnsout.gif) \r\n\r\nRichard has negative money because of his awesome financial skills. He could learn something from Confessions of a Shopaholic. Just saying. Maybe the Army will be a better career for him.\r\n\r\nCaddy and Prince (hehe) asks Esther to come with them while they tell their parents about their engagement because EVERYONE LOVES ESTHER. Except I'm starting to get suspicious about how much everyone loves and respects and needs her, if only because this is being told from Esther's point of view. Maybe she is this nice and sweet, but given she thinks she is so not you'd think if she's repeating people talking about how awesome she is all the time she'd caveat it. But she does not. So Esther, I'm watching you...\r\n\r\nMr. Jarndyce gets Charley as a maid for Esther which yay for Charley getting a better life, although now she doesn't get to see her siblings anymore, so that's sad. Also Hortense really wanted to be Esther's maid, so now that Charley is I fear for her life as well as Rosa's.\r\n\r\nRichard and Ada decide to dissolve their engagement because...reasons. Well I guess the reasons are Jarndyce tells them to cos Richard is getting involved in the J&J case and also will be living in Ireland. But I dunno.\r\n\r\n![breakupnow](/assets/breakupnow.gif) \r\n\r\nThe reasons seem flimsy and also serves to remind me that the two are cousins. But it's cool cos this means Ada is single again so ESTHER GET IN THERE. (I may be skeptical of Esther's opinion of herself, but that doesn't mean I don't want her and Ada to get together.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel, the person who was so cruel to Esther as a kid (in the \"not really caring about her and not having a hard time saying good-bye\" and not \"beating and feeding gruel\" cruelness) is now Mrs. Chadband. Somehow she knows the Snagsby's. Speaking of them, Mrs. Snabsby thinks Jo is Mr. Snagsby's son since they've been acting suspicious. I hope things go all Maury in this story.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hawdon, who I believe was one of Mrs. Badger's ex-husbands is apparently NOT dead. At least that's the assumption of Grandpa Smallweed. Tulkinghorn wants a sample of Hawdon's handwriting, which he thinks George has. But George won't give it to him, because Tulkinghorn is shady as hell.\r\n\r\nLady Dedlock's housekeeper's son comes to talk to Sir & Lady D about the fact that his son is in love with Rosa and wants to marry her. He will give consent ONLY if Rosa stops work at Chesney Wold (which I keep reading as \"Chesney World\" so I picture the place as sort of a crappy amusement park) cos he wants her to be better educated. Sir D is all insulted cos she went to one of his (crappy) schools. Looks like another engagement is going to be broken up.\r\n\r\nGUPPY IS BLACKMAILING LADY D to prove that Esther is related to Lady D. Ugh, this guy. But we do learn that apparently Esther's original last name was Hawdon like that dead-not-dead guy. Except then back to dead since that was apparently Nemo's last name AND that Esther is Lady D's daughter, who she thought was dead.\r\n\r\n![moriartysurprise](/assets/moriartysurprise.gif) \r\n\r\nCaddy gets married and her little brother Peepys bites Prince. Highlight of the wedding.\r\n\r\nJO IS SICK. Esther brings Jo back to Bleak House and Mr. Skimpole tried to get her to throw him out because he's a terrible person. But Esther and Jarndyce do not listen to Skimpole because they are not terrible people. But they do put him in the stable cos they're only so nice. Then he runs away in the night.\r\n\r\nCharley gets sick and almost dies. Then Esther gets super sick and GOES BLIND. And is mostly upset because she's been quarantined from everyone, but mostly Ada who she lovingly watches from the window. And Ada keeps trying to get into the sick room but Esther won't let her. BECAUSE OF LOVE\r\n\r\n![caringtoomuch](/assets/caringtoomuch.gif) \r\n\r\nEsther's other condition\r\nMr. Jobling aka Weevle is acting really suspicious because everyone is suspicious. But now he's acting suspicious towards Guppy, which I think is good suspicious.\r\n\r\nTitle quote from location 6760\r\n\r\nYou'd think Dickens would be done giving us characters. But he is not. New characters, or at least ones briefly introduced in the previous chapters that get some more description.\r\n\r\nSmallweed family: Grandpa is crazy. Hilariously crazy. Probably because all of the kids are miserable and sad and DON'T KNOW HOW TO LAUGH. I'm sure they grew up in a similar way and it's not too surprising that makes you crazy. Crazy or a serial killer. Poor little Charley worked for these people before becoming Esther's maid.\r\n\r\nGeorge: Owns shooting gallery. Owes money/visits with the Smallweeds a lot.\r\n\r\nPhil: Guy at George's Shooting Gallery\r\n\r\nMr. Bucket: Detective. Friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn so I'm pretty sure it should be \"detective.\" NATURALLY not to be trusted\r\n\r\nGridley: Had violent outburst in the Army and ran away and is now in hiding at the shooting gallery. Dies while talking to Flite.\r\n\r\nBagnet family: They don't seem to have much to do with the story at the moment, but their kids have hilarious names so I needed to record: Quebec, Malta, Woolwich.\r\n\r\nVolumnia Dedlock: HOW GREAT IS THIS NAME? She's Sir D's cousin and I don't remember much more about her than that. I got distracted by the name.\r\n\r\nMr. Rouncewell: Mrs. Rouncewell's son. Doesn't want Rosa to work for Lady D if Rosa and his son get married. Insults Sir D, so that's fun.\r\n\r\nMrs. Woodcourt: Comes to stay at Bleak House and annoy Esther. Maybe Esther's future mom-in-law (if she ends up with Mr. Woodcourt instead of Ada).\r\n\r\nMiss Whisk: Mr. Quayle's fiancee and talks about how insisting women stay in the domestic sphere is TERRIBLE and I like her a lot. Even if I think we're supposed to find her ridiculous.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:10:22+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:10:22+00:00","published_at":"2014-02-18T14:42:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de01e5dde22143d000375","key":"books","value":"31242"},{"id":"532de01e5dde22143d000376","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from location 6760 | Dickens, Charles.

The story is from The Millions and called \"Dumbest Thing Ever\": Scribbling in the Margins of Dan Brown's Inferno. If you didn't click on the link to read the story (and you really should) it's basically about one guy who read Dan Brown's Inferno and wrote a bunch of notes in the margins. He then lent the book to a friend, who added his own (hilarious) notes. So OF COURSE I am in.\r\n\r\n![letsdothisbitch](/assets/letsdothisbitch.gif) \r\n\r\nAnother friend of ours decided to join in and thus we're doing our own version of this Margin Scribbling. We won't be reading Dan Brown`1` and we'll be doing a slightly different breakdown. The three of us live in different states so we can't just do a book club type deal. And I'm the only one cool enough (ahahahahaha) to have a book blog, so we can't do our gif-filled style readalong. Hence this, which I have titled The Great (Marginalia) Game because, again, see how cool I am (ahahahahaha) and also I'm a Sherlock nerd so of course I needed to shove a reference in there, even if it makes no sense whatsoever.\r\n\r\n![SherlockScarf](/assets/SherlockScarf.gif) \r\n\r\nWhile we're at it let's throw this in as well\r\nWe'll be reading Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter which I've admittedly already read but that's cool because it's entertaining and I think will be good for this game. I picked up a copy on sale so I get to start. I'll read and mark up the first chapter and then mail it to my friend, who will then read and add his own notes to chapters one and two, before sending it to our other friend. He'll then read and write in the first three chapters, send it back to me, and repeat until we're out of book.\r\n\r\nI assume this is going to take the better part of a year to finish, especially considering how long it takes me to get to the post office (even though the post office is RIGHT THERE and I really have no excuse).

There's a good chance The Rosie Project is going to be that book when I inevitably do a 2014 end of year survey. I am sure this is a book in my pre-blogging days I would have missed, which is sad. Well, I guess sad for alternative universe me, since this version of me did read The Rosie Project and is much better for it.\r\n\r\n![Rosie Project cover](/assets/Rosie Project cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nDon Tillman is a genetics professor at a university in Melbourne and he's a little odd. It's never definitively determined that he is somewhere on the Autism spectrum, although it's heavily implied. He is very literal, has difficulties understanding social cues, and follows a very regimented schedule with every minute accounted for. He has friends, though not a ton, and he's mostly happy with his life. Except he decided he'd like to get married. However, dates don't typically go well for him so he decides to go all scientific with things and create a detailed questionnaire for women to fill out so he can weed out incompatible possible mates. Sexy stuff. Thus begins The Wife Project.\r\n\r\nThe Wife Project isn't producing a lot of qualified applicants (SHOCK) so his friend and fellow professor Gene sets him up with Rosie. Although Don can't figure out WHY since she fails so much of the criteria: she smokes, is late, a vegetarian, and a barmaid. Don decides they are completely incompatible. But Rosie is more interested in finding her biological father. Something a genetic professor might be able to help with. Don offers his (and his lab's) services to help solve Rosie's mystery. But then, against all logic, Don finds himself spending more and more time on The Father Project.\r\n\r\nAnd the book is so funny. I love Don... \r\n\r\n> We survived US Immigration. Previous experience had taught me not to offer observations or suggestions, and I did not need to use my letter of recommendation from David Borenstein at Columbia University characterizing me as a sane and competent person.\r\n\r\n...and I love the interactions between Don and Rosie.\r\n\r\n> \"Wow,\" said Rosie. \"Ever thought of being a grief counselor?\"\r\n\r\n> \"No. I considered a number of careers, but all in the sciences. My interpersonal skills are not strong.\"\r\n\r\n> Rosie burst out laughing. \"You're about to get a crash course in advanced grief counseling.\"\r\n\r\n> It turned out that Rosie was making a sort of joke, as her approach to grief counseling was based entirely on the administration of alcohol.\r\n\r\nI feel like it would have been easy for Don's character to become a cruel stereotype, so good job to Simsion for avoiding that. At one point he's describing growing up to Rosie and all of the doctors and psychologists he visited.\r\n\r\n> \"I now believe that virtually all my problems could be attributed to my brain's being configured differently from those of the majority of humans. All the psychiatric symptoms were a result of this difference, not of any underlying disease.\" \r\n\r\nFirst Attachments, the Fangirl, and now this. Part of me thinks maybe I do like romantic comedies. Maybe. I'm probably not going to search them out, but I will be less skeptical of ones that come with strong recommendations from trusted sources. And hey, this is a great Valentine's Day read, so that timing worked out nicely.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of those trusted sources, since I mentioned I read this book because book bloggers brought it to my attention, I should probably highlight some of those reviews that made me want to pick this up.\r\n\r\nEmily from As the Crowe Flies and Reads\r\nSarah from Sarah Says Read\r\nRayna from Libereading","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:03:26+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:03:36+00:00","published_at":"2014-02-14T13:52:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dde7e5dde22143d00036f","key":"books","value":"16181775"},{"id":"532dde7e5dde22143d000370","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 134, location 1627 | Simsion, Graeme.

Thank you, Alice, for hosting this readalong. Good times, good times.\r\n\r\n![bleak house1-1](/assets/bleak house1-1.jpg) \r\n\r\nThis post, like all my readalong posts, is going to be a mess. I took some notes while reading, so this is going to be all over the place. Apologies.\r\n\r\nI am still having a hard time getting into the third person narration bits. I can't focus. I'm pretty sure in the middle of these the narrator could go \"And this is the answer to every mystery in the rest of the super long book. I can say that here because you're not even paying attention. And I know you're not. Because I'm going to write several more chapters about fog, and probably one about a puddle near the court house.\" Actually, that would be hilarious. I did notice they tried to sneak some Dr. Seuss-ness in these chapters. So maybe Dickens figured he couldn't get away with the \"mystery solved\" thing, but weird rhyming was fine.\r\n\r\nMr. Tulkinghorn continues to not do anything directly bad, but still makes me suspicious with his whole showing up at Chesney Wold unannounced and just wandering up to his room in a tower, and him and Lady Dedlock making \"I have secrets and you know them\" eyes at each other.\r\n\r\n![suspiciouseye](/assets/suspiciouseye.gif) \r\n\r\nRichard can't decide what he wants to be when he grows up and part of me wants to yell at him to make a decision and then I remember how young he is and I want to yell at everyone to CALM DOWN. He'll be fine. Except for the whole \"spending lots of money\" thing. Maybe he will get to be a pirate.\r\n\r\n![piratesherlock](/assets/piratesherlock.png) \r\n\r\nMr. Guppy continues to be super creepy. And Esther feeling like she can't do anything about her stalker makes me very sad.\r\n\r\nYou know what else makes me sad? Ada telling Esther about how in love she is with Richard and Esther all tries to be strong about it but instead watches her while she sleeps and gives her kisses and it's creepy but also sweet and sad. At least they're planning on having the three of them live together after Ada and Richard are married. So that's sweet.\r\n\r\nMr. Guppy has been giving Miss Flite money and paying for her rent. What is your end game, Guppy??\r\n\r\nHey, remember when we all decided we didn't like Skimpole cos he sucks and is a mooch, but we weren't sure if Dickens wants us to like him or not? Then do you remember the part where he talks about how he's a fan of the slaves in America because they add decoration to the landscape, even if they \"don't like it that much\". Yeaaaaahh...\r\n\r\n![majordick](/assets/majordick.gif) \r\n\r\nJo, the guy that was sad about Nemo's death and lives in a super depressing neighborhood, takes some lady (Lady Dedlock YES PROBABLY) around to see areas connected to Nemo's death.\r\n\r\nMr. Boythorn put up adorably threatening signs for Sir Leicester to look at over their disputed piece of property. I'm liking Boythorn more and more. Please don't turn out to be Fosco.\r\n\r\nEsther thinks looking at Lady Dedlock is like looking in a mirror and WHHHAAAAA? And then she has the same voice. But she won't look at her. Hmmmm. So, they're related? Sekritly?\r\n\r\n![suspiciousbuffy](/assets/suspiciousbuffy.gif) \r\n\r\nMr. Jobling takes over Nemo's old room at Krook's and is very upset that Nemo had the audacity to die in Jobling's (soon to hopefully be) room. THE NERVE of some people.\r\n\r\nAnd that's roughly where we're at. Richard is being indecisive about jobs but not about how he loves Ada. Esther still loves Ada but also keeps cutting off on telling us things and WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, LADY? She also sees herself in Lady Dedlock and Hmmm?? Then we need to know what's going on with the Guppy Gang and why are they renting that room from Krook and working for Snagsby and what's going on there? Will Boythorn and Leicester ever make up? (That would be sweet, but I sort of hope not.) What's up with Hortense? Think she's going to murder Rosa in her sleep? Who was Nemo?\r\n\r\nNew Characters. Because of course there are a million of them and Alice was right about that whole \"you need a character list\" thing.\r\nHortense - Lady Dedlock's...some lady who is French and has a tight face and is jealous of Rosa. Also has pretty good reason to be pissed at Lady Dedlock after she makes her walk home in the rain.\r\n\r\nMr. & Mrs. Badger - take Richard in to apprentice surgery? I think I understood that correctly. Be an apprentice surgeon on a boat. The most important thing about them is both Mr. & Mrs. (but mostly Mr) Badger are super into Mrs. Badger's previous husbands. So they're fun.\r\n\r\nMr. Turveydrop, the junior - Miss Jellyby's secret fiance, LOVES TO DANCE.\r\n\r\n![sunsetarms](/assets/sunsetarms.gif) \r\n\r\nAlso his first name is Prince.\r\n\r\nMr. Turveydrop, the senior - Real fancy guy. Spends all his money on fancy clothes and being seen in fancy places. So, he's pretty much the Victorian equivalent of a Real Housewife. I'm sure there are wine fueled drunken rages and old timey plastic surgery as well.\r\n\r\n![RHfabulous](/assets/RHfabulous.gif) \r\n\r\nMr. Woodcourt - \"Dark surgeon\" who was hanging out at dinner with the Bleak House Crew (BHC) and the Badgers, but we didn't pay attention to him cos everyone is too busy focused on how awesome Mrs. Badger's previous husbands were.\r\n\r\nMr. Quale - Someone I should probably know more about. I don't, though. Follows around Pardiggle talking about how great charities are. Friends with Guppy. Don't trust.\r\n\r\nMr. Gusher - See Quale. Not as in they are the same person but more as in that's all I know about the guy.\r\n\r\nNeckette family - SUPER SAD STORY about the debt collector that kept visiting Skimpole. He died and left behind 3 small children. The oldest, 13, has to go to work while the 5 year old watches the baby and they live in a tiny cold room and dammit Dickens, must you keep it up with the orphans?\r\n\r\nJo - Another orphan kid. He showed up in the last section but I didn't know he'd come up again. He knew Nemo and was super sad when he died. He lives in a place called Toms-all-alone and it's depressing.\r\n\r\nMr. Smallwood - See Quale and Gusher. *Update* via Megs. Looks like a depressed monkey\r\n\r\nMr. Jobling - See Quale, Gusher, and Smallwood. I should know more about these guys probably. I know they eat a lot of food and are UNTRUSTWORTHY.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T19:00:42+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:00:42+00:00","published_at":"2014-02-11T12:05:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dddda5dde22aa760001ce","key":"books","value":"31242"},{"id":"532dddda5dde22aa760001cf","key":"citation","value":"Title quote location 4755 | Dickens, Charles.

I was so in the mood for a readalong because one, my reading habits since December have been...lacking. And two, I have found many GIFs that need shared with the (book blogging) world so good timing.\r\n\r\n![bleak house1](/assets/bleak house1.jpg) \r\n\r\nI know we're not really doing an intro post BUT I do have a confession before I dive right in.\r\n\r\nEvery time I say \"Bleak House\" in my head, I sing it to the tune of Brick House. I feel like this is the wrong tone for the book. Probably. Although maybe Dickens will surprise me.\r\n\r\nAlice said we should create character lists. Which sounds like a super smart thing to do and something that I knew I wasn't going to. I am not nearly coordinated enough/have enough space to be taking notes while reading on the subway. This also means I keep mixing up character names. After reading the first 11 chapters, here's the character list I've come up with, which will also serve as my post, cos man are there a lot of characters.\r\n\r\nLady Dreadlock: Yes, I'm aware it's actually Dedlock but I kept saying \"Dreadlock,\" which led to a fun character visual so it's staying.\r\n\r\n![ladydreadlock](/assets/ladydreadlock.jpg) \r\n\r\nLet's see, what do I know about her? She is married some some guy and was bored in this big house so she went to another house and commented on some handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. Tulkinghorn: Dreadlock's old fashioned lawyer guy, whom I do not trust. He seems sketchy.\r\n\r\n![hermionesideeye](/assets/hermionesideeye.gif) \r\n\r\nEsther: Girl with really depressing childhood cos its a Dickens book. I mean, come on, a little kid is told that their birthday is the saddest day of the year and her godmother (who is actually HER AUNT and I bet that will be important at some point) tells her she wishes she was never born. I want to like more cos she's the narrator and all but she's sort of boring and REALLY just wants to please everyone. Especially Ada. Because she loves her.\r\n\r\n![lovebff](/assets/lovebff.gif) \r\n\r\nAda: Lady who has something to do with this Jarndyce case (which I really don't understand, but I think that might be the point) and also sorta loves EstherAlso loves her cousin Rick, who I'm hoping is a distant cousin. I don't know much about her yet. She's as interesting as Esther.\r\n\r\nRichard: Except people keep calling him Rick, so let's go with that. Also part of this Jarndyce case...somehow. None of them (Esther, Ada, Rick) seem to know exactly what's going on, but hey, a place to live. That's cool. He loves his (again hopefully distant) cousin Ada. And people seem to want them to get together. Except Esther probably doesn't. He has some ideas about money that match mine, which means they aren't great.\r\n\r\nMr. Guppy: Guy I really liked at first when they described his technicolor neckerchief but then got all creepy with his aggressive engagement proposal to Esther. I'm sure there are reasons for his sudden proposal that comes after all of meeting her two times and also she doesn't know who you are and also, Ada.\r\n\r\n![loveyoudog](/assets/loveyoudog.gif) \r\n\r\nMr. Guppy, pretty much\r\nThe Jellybelly family: I know it's actually Jellybys but please see my \"dreadlock\" reasoning. The matriarch is REALLY into doing...something for Africa. Charity I think. The whole house is a mess because she's so focused on writing all these letters. Except she actually just dictates and her daughter writes. The husband is meek and doesn't really do anything and I don't know why HE can't just take care of the house if he's not doing anything else. But instead I think we're supposed to hate her cos she's putting her other work before her family/housework.\r\n\r\nMr. John Jarndyce: I keep calling him Jaundice guy. He must have something to do with the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit (try not to be too impressed by my detective skills) and he sends Esther to this school after her godmother/aunt dies before having her move to his house and be his housekeeper. He also has his cousins (everyone is a cousin) Ada and Richard. I think I like him. Really focused on the way the wind is blowing.\r\n\r\nHarold Skimpole: Hehe, skinpole. Anyway, he's sort of an ass. He seems all nice and fun and not concerned with things like working himself to death but instead wants to enjoy the little things. Things he also enjoys: not paying any attention to his money so when he's about to get in trouble for his debt he makes other people pay it. Cos he's so childish, you see, and children don't deal with money and shut up, jerk. Esther and Richard pay off his debt and then Jarndyce laughs at them and pays them back and makes them promise not to give him anymore money.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rouncewell: Housekeeper at Lady Dreadlock's boring house. Has a son who is an engineer and thinks being an engineer is a FAILURE and I think I'm going to have to send some quotes to my (engineer) brother. Tells a story about how the boring house is actually haunted by some rich lady that walks back and forth all the time. Not the scariest ghost, so I guess I see why Dreadlock thinks the place is boring.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pardiggle: Like Mrs. Jellybelly, in that she's a lady obsessed with her charity work and also her family hates her. In this case her family seems to have a point cos she is very brash and she keeps dragging her 5 kids with her and taking all of their allowance money to give to different causes. She drags her sons along with Ada and Esther to this bricklayer's house. He beats his wife and he drinks all the time and his kids are flithy and they all hate Pardiggle, who insists on reading the Bible to them.\r\n\r\n![JLaw_thankgod](/assets/JLaw_thankgod.gif) \r\n\r\nHere's Mrs. Pardiggle\r\nBoythorn: A friend of Jarndyce. He's fun and loud and has a pet bird that sits on him. He hates Lady Dedlock's family.\r\n\r\nMr. & Mrs. Snagsby: Law writer guy and his wife. They hire people to copy law stuff. Things that you would do before copy machines were invented.\r\n\r\nKrook: Guy that owns this shop that seems to only buy things but not sell them, which seems like a bad business model. Also rents out some rooms, including one to this old lady that seems crazy but might also know what's going on with the J&J case.\r\n\r\nMiss Flitt: Crazy lady that seems to know about the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nNemo: Means \"NO ONE\" as Tulkinghorn deduces and is found dead in one of Krook's rooms from an opium overdose.\r\n\r\nSo. What is this J&J case? What's with the dead body at the end? What is Mr. Tulkinghorn up to? What was up with Guppy's proposal? Will Esther quit being boring and going on about how awesome she is at housekeeping and making kids like her?

I could just assume that you've seen my recommendation and decided \"Thanks, but no thanks. This isn't for me.\" I could assume that, but instead I'm choosing to assume that my other mentions were too subtle, or just obscured by puppy pictures. So now I'm going to bash you over the head with a recommendation to check out Night Vale.\r\n\r\nI first heard about this show on PBS Idea Channel (another thing I'm going to keep bugging you guys about) in their show \"How does Night Vale confront us with the unknown?\" The show describes Night Vale as \"borrowing Lovecraft's (as in H.P.) spirit\" but with \"paralytic terror replaced with drab mundanity\", taking \"unspeakable abomination and turning it into unremarkable absurdity,\" and HOW HAVE YOU NOT STARTED LISTENING TO THIS YET?\r\n\r\nI listen to it sometimes on my commute if I'm not feeling my book/reading in general and I constantly find I'm giggling to myself, which is fun cos sometimes that means people will slowly edge away and I get a bit more space.\r\n\r\nNeed more reason? How about 10 of my favorite quotes from the episodes I've listened to so far:\r\n\r\n1. \"There appear to be catastrophic earthquakes happening right here in Night Vale that absolutely no one can feel. Well, submit an insurance claim, anyway. See what you can get, right?\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Wednesday has been cancelled due to a scheduling error.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"Hello, radio audience. I come to you live from under my desk, where I have dragged my microphone and am currently in the fetal position.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Saturday, the public library will be unknowable. Citizens will forget the existence of the library from 6am Saturday morning until 11pm that night. The library will be under a sort of renovation. It is not important what kind of renovation.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"This just came across the wire! The secret police have issued a new statement shedding more light on last night\u2019s PTA meeting incident. The noisy portal and subsequent dinosaur attack that brutally interrupted discussion of swing set repairs on the elementary school playground stayed open long after recreation center employees thought they had rounded up all of the ancestral avian beasts\u2014 and, authorities warn, there is still at least one more pteranodon on the loose.\r\nCitizens should cover themselves with a low-SPF sunscreen and hide in a tiled bathroom.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"In light of the ever declining sales of newspapers and the rise of competition from digital media The Night Vale Daily Journal announced that it has developed a new business model. Publishing Editor, Leanne Hart, speaking to television and internet reporters outside the burned down shell of the The Journal\u2019s distribution plant, said their new mission, as a newspaper, is to kill news bloggers with hatchets. \r\nIn this bold new initiative, a game changing strategy by one of the industry\u2019s stalwarts, The Daily Journal plans to just go to bloggers homes and places of employment, with hatchets, and then chop them up, the bloggers. Until they, the bloggers, are dead.\"\r\n\r\n7. \"Exciting news about the abandoned mine shaft outside of town, where people who vote incorrectly are taken by the secret police: HBO On-Demand will be made available to prisoners during their indefinite detention!\"\r\n\r\n8. \"I\u2019m still not completely sold on there being more than one mountain. It\u2019s possible that the mountain apologists built a single mountain in order to prove their skewed world view.\"\r\n\r\n9. \"The Night Vale medical board has issued a new study indicating that you have a spider somewhere on your body at all times, but especially now. The study said the further research would be needed to determine exactly where on your body the spider is and what its intentions are. Only that it is definitely there and is statistically likely to be one of the really ugly ones.\"\r\n\r\n10. And of course, Night Vale City Council's motto, \"If you see something, say nothing, and drink to forget.\"\r\n\r\nSo. Yeah. Bet you feel pretty silly you haven't already listened to this. You should probably get on that.\r\n\r\nOh and um, how to make this book related? Well, there's the whole Lovecraft thing. And the show is put together by Commonplace Books.

I also don't have a book read to review so yeah, it's going to be some time before I get to that point. In the meantime, here are the top ten characters I would never want to change places with.\r\n\r\n1. Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins: Because OBVIOUSLY. I'm pretty sure this won't be an original selection but also, do not want to play the Hunger Games kthxbai.\r\n\r\n2. Dana Franklin from Kindred by Octavia Butler: Dana is a black woman that gets sent back to antebellum Maryland and could things be shittier than that? Not really. In this case I would need to become Dana, or at least a black lady, for the terribleness to be at max levels.\r\n\r\n3. Eddie Russett from Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde: Anytime you're dealing with a dystopia you know it's not somewhere you want to be. This is a place I might be able to handle but all the Leapbacks, the strict social structure, the attack swans. No thank you.\r\n\r\n4. Anyone from 1984 by George Orwell: Actually, I guess being Big Brother wouldn't be so bad, but anyone else NO THANK YOU. I haven't read this book since high school (which means I'm probably due for a re-read) but that book scarred me.\r\n\r\n5. Offred from The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood: Another one that's probably on a lot of lists but yeah, dystopian (again) world where women have no rights. At all.\r\n\r\n6. Jack's Ma from Room by Emma Donoghue: Woman kidnapped and raped for YEARS while trying to make a normal world for her son. Yeah, no.\r\n\r\n7. Anyone in the Lamberts family from The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen: Not a dystopia, but I think I'd rather take my chances in the Hunger Games. I don't even want to be a distant cousin of these guys.\r\n\r\n8. Anyone in Dreamcatcher by Stephen King: Fart aliens. Do you need more? Sure there are lots of terrifying King worlds, but this one is scary and horrible.\r\n\r\n9. Kathy H. from Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro: It's hard to talk about this one without spoilers so I'm just going to say...reasons.\r\n\r\n10. Piggy from Lord of the Flies by William Golding: This book. This book about how terrible little English boys are, apparently. I don't like camping in good, non-murdery conditions.  So this would just be a double whammy.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:48:56+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T18:48:56+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-28T12:09:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532ddb185dde2289f6000081","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532ddb185dde2289f6000082","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532ddb185dde2289f6000080","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"532ddad35dde22143d00035d","title":"Wedding Update: Big decisions *DONE!*","slug":"wedding-update-big-decisions-done","url":"/articles/wedding-update-big-decisions-done","body":"![ring book-1](/assets/ring book-1.jpg) \r\n\r\nI always forget how much time has passed since my last wedding update. Of course I also forget how much time has passed on this engagement (over a year) so I'm bad at keeping track of dates and time in general. I did mention in a comment to Emily that I had a wedding post coming up. And then I forgot to write one. I'm going to blame Tumblr since I have been spending way too much time on there this past week. But I'm sitting around procrastinating on some chores while watching that TLC show Four Weddings`1` and realized I should probably write that update.\r\n\r\nANYWAY, I think I now have all of the big wedding decisions done, which is pretty exciting. Update on the last post where I went over shit we had figured out.\r\n\r\nVenue: Still figured out! I want to go see it again cos apparently they've done a lot of renovations to the room we're in. Everyone we've talked to says the changes are awesome and it still pretty much looks the same, only better. The venue includes food AND the wedding cake AND the ceremony space so BAM! So much finished right here.\r\n\r\nWedding dress: Also still figured out, and should be coming in soon. Which will be cool cos it's been over a year since I saw the thing. Apparently these things take 9 months to make if you order it. But if you're not getting married for like a year and a half from the time you order it they figure they have some time to make it. And they're right. It's way better that they take their time with it rather than putting it into my hands where there's a good chance something will go wrong. I even have the shoes already and I've been sporadically wearing them around the house to break them in.\r\n\r\nBridesmaids dresses: Done! And everyone ordered them. And one of the girls even got theirs already so that's fun.\r\n\r\nPhotographer: Done! Found a company we really really liked. They did a great job showing us their whole set up (they do all of the work in house) and I loved what they do. Fun story from one of the photographers we didn't go with.\r\nThe photographer showed us an album of their work. As we're flipping through the album we notice one of the big pictures where both the groom and a groomsman both had their eyes closed. When Boyfriend+ pointed this out the answer was \"Well, we let you pick whatever photo you want, even if someone has their eyes closed.\" His response: \"Yes, that's great. But you don't have to show ME this picture when trying to sell me on your service.\" A week or so later they called me to follow up. Now, I didn't have the number saved to my phone so when I saw this number come up I didn't recognize it. Apparently they weren't sure who they were calling since they responded to my \"Hello?\" with a \"Hi, who am I speaking to?\" I think I actually made a scoffing noise and said \"Well, you called me. So who are you?\" At which point Boyfriend+ started laughing, they sounded taken aback, and once they announced themselves I felt even better about going with someone else. I won't name names cos that'd be mean but yeah.\r\n\r\nDJ: Done! This was a pretty hard choice cos we really liked everyone we talked to but I'm happy with who we decided to go with. Now I need to work on the list of \"Must Play\" and \"Must Avoid\" songs. We already figured out the first dance song but I guess I'm supposed to figure out a Father/Daughter dance (assuming my dad wants to do that). Maybe I should farm that out to him...\r\n\r\nFlorist: Done! My mom came out last weekend and we went to see three florists in one day. After the first place she was ready to sign on but I need to know I'm making the right choice. I was. We ended up going with the first place, which does the flowers for our venue anyway. The venue comes with ceremony flowers (win!) which this place provides. Normally you sort of take what they give you, but now that we signed with them for all the other stuff they said they'd work with us a bit more on the ceremony flowers.\r\n\r\nInvitations: Ordered AND delivered. Which was insanely fast. I think it was 2 days. I assumed this would be weeks but yeah, that was pretty sweet. Plus it means if we need to order more (man, I hope not) then at least I know it's a quick turn around.\r\n\r\nHoneymoon: Booked! And I (finally) send my passport out for renewal. Getting that photograph taken is a real hassle. Hopefully there won't be any problems. But really, I got all of the measurements and despite what guy at CVS said, I'm pretty sure I can do just as good of a job as he can. It's not like he's an expert passport-photo-taker. The second problem is my inability to go to the post office even when I walk by it several times a week. But ugh, I really need to psych myself up anytime I need to go there.\r\n\r\nI think now we just have the details to figure out. Wedding favors have been decided, I just need to poke some people to make things happen. I'm still deciding if I want to do literary couples or fav books as the table names. I'm thinking literary couples and I sort of don't care if people at the wedding don't already know who Eleanor and Park are. THEY CAN LEARN. Boyfriend+ still needs to pick out a suit. We need to get the wedding bands. Oh, and we still need an officiant. You know, details.\r\n\r\nBut I think we're in a pretty good place with everything. And things haven't actually been that stressful which is amazing. Hopefully it stays that way right up to the wedding day.\r\n\r\n`1` Apparently my mom saw some casting call asking for brides in my area getting married when I am if they want to be on the show. And I laughed and laughed and laughed cos oh GOD no. No. I don't need strangers, both in person and on TV, judging my wedding. Besides I'd probably be there as the clueless bride who is like \"Our theme is...umm...well I liked this thing so yeah, I went with that. That's a theme right?\" If your curious our theme is \"wedding,\" and I think we are NAILING IT. Also the prize is a honeymoon, which is awesome cos I heart free vacations but we already have our honeymoon booked so yeah. This was a long ramble to say you won't be seeing me on TV.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:47:47+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T18:47:47+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-26T19:37:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532ddad35dde22143d00035f","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532ddad35dde22143d000360","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532ddad35dde22143d00035e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"532dda655dde2289f6000079","title":"You guys want to go see a *dead body?*","slug":"you-guys-want-to-go-see-a-dead-body","url":"/articles/you-guys-want-to-go-see-a-dead-body","body":"My reading slump from December is continuing into January. Well, not so much slump as slog? I'm reading, just slower than normal. No reason. I'm enjoying the books I'm reading, so it's not like I struggling through these books. I'm just easily distracted and there's a lot of Sherlock to watch (and then re-watch).\r\n\r\n![Different Seasons cover](/assets/Different Seasons cover.jpeg) \r\n\r\nThe minithon helped me a bit with the reading (and a lot with the eating-mini-things and coming-up-with-mini-justifications) and after finishing up with Bryson's In A Sunburned Country I picked up Different Seasons by Stephen King. Laura got it for me for Christmas and since it's a collection of King novellas, it counted as mini. I mean, sort of mini. By King standards. By other author standards it's a bunch of novels. Figure the book is over 600 pages and there's only 4 stories in here. Not long novels, but still, you could call them novels and people wouldn't call you a liar.\r\n\r\nYou probably already know 3 of the stories. They've been made into movies, and that's not to say you only know them cos of their movie-ness, but you know...if you know them, it's likely because MOVIES. I've seen 2 out of the 3 movies, and know of the third, so I'll just assume you're all in the same boat as me.\r\n\r\nRight, maybe I should get to the stories. And since this is 4 short novels, I'll give you a brief review of each.\r\n\r\n![Shawshank cover](/assets/Shawshank cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nSo the first one is Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, which was my favorite. The other stories are good but I almost wish this was the last story because it's hard for the other ones to compete. If you don't already know the story, how'd you manage that? Because I'm pretty sure that movie is playing on TV on some channel right now. Andy Dufresne is in Shawshank prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. Long-timer Red tells the story of Andy, who seems to confound the prisoners and guards alike. He has a confidence about him, even in these dark circumstances. There are no surprises going from the movie to the book. What you see on film is essentially what you get in the story, so good job, filmmakers. This isn't a horror story. There's nothing supernatural here, although there is some violence. I highly recommend this one. Probably one of King's bests.\r\n\r\nI know I said that I wish this story came at the end because the other stories had a hell of an act to follow. But the other novellas did a good job. I mean, I still like Shawshank best, but the others are excellent in their own right.\r\n\r\n![Apt Pupil cover](/assets/Apt Pupil cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nThe second story is Apt Pupil which is the second movie I saw and I can't even remember why I saw it. But I'm pretty sure I not only saw it but went out of my way to to rent it. Possibly on VHS. Unlike Shawshank and the other stories in this collection, this is the closest to a horror story in this collection. Again, there's nothing supernatural here but it's scary. Scary and disturbing and gave me stress headaches. Which I guess is sort of a good thing cos this is a story about Nazis so I think being deeply disturbed is the correct response. Thirteen year old Todd Bowden discovers there's a fugitive Nazi living in his neighborhood and decides to blackmail the guy into telling him everything he can about the concentration camps and the general shittery that was the Nazis. The Nazi Arthur Denker/Kurt Dussander at first doesn't want to reminisce but eventually something awakens in him. It's a messed up story that gets more and more violent and more and more hopeless. It was very well written, but not one I think I'll be re-reading anytime soon. Which is vaguely how I remember the movie so while I'm pretty sure the movie changed a lot, it did at least keep that spirit.\r\n\r\n![Body cover](/assets/Body cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nThe third story is The Body, which was made into the film Stand By Me, which is the movie I haven't seen. Which is silly because I hear excellent things about it and I should probably fix that. ANYWAY, this is another story you probably already know the plot of, but I'll share anyway. Four twelve-year-olds find out there's a dead body and decide to go see it. OK, well that's the basic plot and what puts the story in motion. The story is a coming of age story about these four boys, Gordie (who is narrating the story as an adult), Chris, Vern, and Teddy. None of them are coming from great home lives. Gordie's parents have never really paid attention to him and the death of his older brother made things worse. Chris comes from a family of criminals and is branded a delinquent by the town. Teddy idolizes his father who has severe PTSD after coming home from Vietnam and caused permanent damage to the boy before being taken away. Everyone, including his family, picks on Vern (with possible beatings, but I kept mixing up Chris and Vern so it could be possible Vern didn't get beaten at home. Or they both did. I could try to skim through and see if I can find evidence one way or another but laaaaazy). The boys go on a journey to find this dead body, face down bullies, learn about themselves, all the things you expect from a coming of age story. Again, not a horror story but not exactly a happy story either. Very well done though.\r\n\r\n![Breathing Method cover](/assets/Breathing Method cover.jpg) \r\n\r\nThe final story is movie-less. For now. And probably forever since I don't know if it would work on the screen. It's sort of a quiet story about a club where people tell stories. There's sort of something magical about this club, which on the surface seems like a stuffy, wood-paneled, old man's club. No one really explains what's going on, but there seem to be lots of books to read by authors that can't be found anywhere else, published by companies that don't seem to exist outside this home. And people tell stories. Sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're sad, sometimes they're scary. We hear little bits of a few of the stories but the main one we focus on is the Christmas story \"The Breathing Method\". Now, this isn't a story about Christmas, but the Thursday before Christmas is when people tell the most...off-putting tale. I won't go into it but to let you know that I really liked this story. The whole story (frame & main) have the same feeling and in the end nothing is really explained, which works for it.\r\n\r\nOverall good times. If you want to try out King, I recommend his short works. And if you want something a bit longer than his short stories but aren't quite ready to commit to one of his full novels (which, I mean, can drag on) this is a great place to try. Really, if nothing else, try to find Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:45:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T18:46:20+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-24T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dda655dde2289f600007b","key":"books","value":"39662 | 39664 | 10618 | 11574 | 10580"},{"id":"532dda655dde2289f600007c","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 393 | King, Stephen.

At least when the conversation makes me go \"WTF is going on.\" I was on NJ Transit (lest you think all the crazy happens on the subway or LIRR) when the person behind me started a phone call that included a conspiracy between Hollywood and Wall St to control what museum galleries are allowed to show and that terrorist are going to try to take down the new WTC building because it's ugly. (Terrorists HATE ugly things. All about beauty, those guys.) One of the things she said that I felt needed to be shared was this:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2014-01-20 at 5.45.28 PM](/assets/Screen Shot 2014-01-20 at 5.45.28 PM.png) \r\n\r\nUnfortunately she didn't elaborate on what these \"new fangled reading styles\" are. Not exactly. She started ranting about text message language and how if you're going to go on the internet you need to learn a whole new language. She just didn't address how this new language changed the whole \"read a page, turn page, read next page\" thing. I imagine she thinks people are now learning to read a sentence, skip ahead 30 pages, read a third of a paragraph, back to that first page to read only the LAST sentence, etc. You know, those new fangled styles. \r\n\r\nThis clearly isn't a real post. This is more a \"I really want to write some post but I'm not done with Different Seasons yet and I don't like the Tuesday Top Ten prompt so I'll just ramble about something else.\" This also gives you the opportunity to see what you're missing if you don't follow me on Twitter.\r\n\r\nI also started a Tumblr because I give into peer pressure, even if it's really weak peer pressure. And really more pressure that people are having fun somewhere without me and I don't want to be left out. I wouldn't recommend following me on Tumblr because at the moment all I'm doing is reblogging random gif sets about Sherlock, Parks & Rec, and Pushing Daisies.

I'm not sure what it was. Probably the holidays coupled with the fact that I wasn't working (or at least I wasn't riding the train) just meant that instead of doing any reading I mostly watched stupid TV. (Also Sherlock. Lots of Sherlock.) So I picked up Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country to help get me out of the slump because 1) Bryson is great and his books are always a fun read 2) it was cold out and I wanted to read about somewhere warm 3) I had recently met up with Kayleigh and she's from Australia so hey, seems like a good choice.\r\n\r\n![In a Sunburned Country cover](/assets/In a Sunburned Country cover.jpeg) \r\n\r\nSunburned Country (or Down Under which is the British title) is about Bryson traveling around Australia, both the cities and the outback. There are a few topics he touches on again and again:\r\n\r\nAustralia is full of things, animals and environment, that are actively trying to kill you. At all times.\r\nAustralia is BIG.\r\nAustralia is far away and most of the rest of the world seems to forget it's there. Which is stupid of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nBryson describes Australia as a fusion of American and British culture.\r\n[Australia] had a casualness and vivacity - a lack of reserve, comfortableness with strangers - that felt distinctly American, but hung on a British framework. In their optimism and informality, Australians could pass for a glance as Americans, but they drove on the left, drank tea, played cricket, adorned their public places with statues of Queen Victoria, dressed their children in the sort of school uniform that only a Britannic people could wear without conspicuous regret.\r\n\r\nOverall Bryson loves Australia. Even when he was almost murdered by some dogs in Canberra (or not since you never actually SEE the dogs) he still likes the place. He has nothing but nice things to say about the people, the cities, the deserts, sometimes even the animals. Well maybe not the ones that want him dead, but some of the others. He gets drunk at strange bars in the middle of no where on his way to see the outback, the part of Australia many Australians never even get to visit. He listens to a lot of cricket on the radio. And of course there are lots of historical anecdotes about people who have died horribly trying to cross the huge country. Really everything you'd expect from a Bryson book.\r\n\r\nOh and I feel I should point out that Bryson acknowledges that the (American) title of his book is taken from a poem, except it's changed from \"sunburnt\" to \"sunburned\". As he says, it should be called In a Sunburnt Country. But it isn't.\r\n\r\nI can't say this is my favorite Bryson BUT this did make me want to visit Australia. Dammit, why are you so far away from me? Really though, you can't go wrong with Bryson. Now I just need to get my hands on his new book.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:38:16+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:47:43+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-16T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd8985dde22fdb2000340","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 288 | Bryson, Bill.

Because if you're not, you should probably go check that out right now. I'll wait. Or I mean, I won't just sit here while you're reading it, but my website won't self destruct or something if you leave it open in a different tab while you go read H&H.\r\n\r\nBrosh wrote a book. Illustrated a book. Both. It's stories about her life, told mostly through her MS Paint drawings, which means they're both crude and AMAZING. Even if you're not already familiar with her work, if you've spent a significant amount of time on the internet I'm sure you've seen this\r\n\r\n![allthethings](/assets/allthethings.jpg) \r\n\r\nShe shares stories about her childhood, her life with her (now) husband and their dogs, and her battles with depression. The stories are mostly ridiculous and absurd and had me crying laughing, even though I knew a fair amount of them already. Even her more serious stories are funny. Or at least have funny elements, while still being poignant.\r\n\r\nA lot of the book is made up of stories that are on her blog. Which normally I'd think \"Well, then I don't need to buy your book cos the content is free online.\" And honestly, if you decide to go that route it's understandable. But I've read her entire blog (which I recommend but she has posts going back to 2009 so it may take some time) so when I heard about her book I knew I would be getting it, even if there are only a couple new stories. And then it ended up that about half the book is made up of new stories so WIN. And a lot of the new stories are some of the best ones, so another good reasons to pick up the book.\r\n\r\nThere's no real theme to the book, other than they're stories about Brosh. They don't go in order, which is nice because I don't know that reading all of her childhood stories followed later by all of her depression stories would have been good choice. So you jump around from This Is Why I'll Never Be An Adult (my favorite, and has lines like \"For a little while, I actually feel grown-up and responsible. I strut around with my head held high, looking the other responsible people in the eye with that knowing glance that says 'I understand. I'm responsible now too. Just look at my groceries.'\"), The God of Cake, and Depression Part Two. It's a quick read too. I read most of it on the train ride coming home after I bought it and then finished it the next morning. Oh and her dedication page reads:\r\n\r\nFor Scott.\r\nWhat now, fucker?\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Brosh, well, you probably already have her book.  But if you haven't picked it up yet, you should. And I would recommend a physical copy as opposed to an ecopy. I don't know how the images show up but they're important so big color illustrations are the way to go. If you're not sure about Brosh, check out her blog. The first post of hers I ever read was The Awkward Situation Survival Guide and while it's not the best story, it did hook me in enough to read ALL THE BLOG (see what I did there? meta). If you're not a fan of Brosh well, I don't know why you're reading a review for this book. You already know you don't want this. I'm not going to change your mind. Not matter how much I love it.\r\n\r\nI realize this review is a mess. I'm sorry. You should probably read Kayleight @ Nylon Admiral and Laura @ Devouring Texts reviews. They're far more coherent.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:34:55+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:47:14+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-13T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd7cf5dde2289f6000072","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 227 | Brosh, Allie.

Thus was born the mini-readathon where we'll read/tweet for 8 hours and eat lots of snacks. And the theme is mini, but the more you can stretch that definition to fit what you are going to eat/read, the better.\r\n\r\nLet's see what I have\r\n\r\nBooks\r\nI have three titles right now that may or may not be changed as the day goes on/I think of other mini excuses.\r\n\r\nIn A Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson - mini because I'm juuuust about done with it.\r\nThe Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa - mini because it's only 180 pages\r\nDifferent Seasons by Stephen King - mini because they're short stories.\r\n\r\n![IMG_5444](/assets/IMG_5444.JPG) \r\n\r\nFood\r\nI was going to start with eggs (little chicken fetuses) but then I decided to make something both Boyfriend+ and I could enjoy, so I'm going with silver dollar (TINY) pancakes. Except he's not down yet so I don't have completed pancakes to show you. But the batter is in that blue bowl behind the books so I'm on my way.\r\n\r\nI'll share my other snacks throughout the day/as I figure out what they'll be. Because I am terrible at planning but I'm pretty good at bullshitting so I should be able to come up with some more mini foods.\r\n\r\nMINITHON UPDATE 1:\r\n\r\nHere we are, about half way through this mini-readathon. How's everyone's reading/eating going?\r\n\r\nI finished 1 book, except that book is the Sunburned Country one and I only had about 50 pages left. STILL COUNTS. Plus I've been reading it since before the holidays which is silly that it's taken me so long. I love Bryson. I love the book. The holidays just made me reading lazy. Hence why this readalong has come at such a great time.\r\n\r\nI have been eating though, because priorities. First up, here are those pancakes in their finished form.\r\n\r\n![minipancakes](/assets/minipancakes.jpg) \r\n\r\nWe also had some blueberry jam with them that my mom made. It counts towards this cos it's in a tiny mason jar. I put another mason jar with OJ in the picture for comparison.\r\n\r\n![Masonjarjam](/assets/Masonjarjam.JPG) \r\n\r\nTHEN I also found a couple snacks. I was scrounging through our pantry and realized we bought a Costco sized thing of Welch's fruit snacks. While Costco is definitely not mini-sized, the bags themselves are. PLUS these are really snacks for children, a.k.a. mini-people, so COUNTS\r\n\r\n![minifruitsnacks](/assets/minifruitsnacks.jpg) \r\n\r\nThen I wanted some chocolate and we have this espresso bean dark chocolate bar, which is delicious. The chocolate breaks off into small pieces so mini. PLUS the profits from this candy bar go towards saving endangered animals. Which are endangered cos there are only a tiny amount of them left. BOOM, MINI AGAIN\r\n\r\n![candybar](/assets/candybar.JPG) \r\n\r\nI was about to start King's Different Seasons but then my mom called and we were discussing wedding centerpieces. It was still sort of bookish since I'm trying to figure a way to insert books/literary couples into the table numbers.\r\n\r\nI hope everyone is eating lots of delicious mini things. Oh, and also reading. See you on Twitter!\r\n\r\nThoning update the second and final:\r\nI'm about at the end of my minithon time. A friend's birthday celebration is this evening so Boyfriend+ and I will be heading out to celebrate and play some drinking bingo. I'm going to do a bit more reading now so I will still be following along on Twitter till the end.\r\n\r\nI managed roughly another 50 pages in Different Seasons (starting with Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption) and then got distracted by internet things. Like Alice live tweeting episodes of 19 Kids and Counting.\r\n\r\nI did manage to eat more mini snacks! Or snack rather. I made a small plate of nachos. And since I'm at the bottom of the bag, pretty much all of the tortilla chips were tiny. AND shredded cheese is pretty much just really tiny slices of cheese SO THERE.\r\n\r\n![nachos](/assets/nachos.jpg) \r\n\r\nTika, thank you for hosting this minithon which as been super fun, even if I have to cut out a bit early.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:32:32+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:46:49+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-11T16:14:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd7405dde2289f600006d","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532dd7405dde2289f600006e","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532dd7405dde2289f600006c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"mini things","slug":"mini-things","url":"/articles/tags/mini-things"},{"value":"Readathon","slug":"readathon","url":"/articles/tags/readathon"}]}]},{"id":"532dd53f5dde22fdb2000334","title":"December and 2013 *Reading Wrap Up*","slug":"december-and-2013-reading-wrap-up","url":"/articles/december-and-2013-reading-wrap-up","body":"[december-calendar-1](/assets/december-calendar-1.jpg) \r\n\r\n2013 is done.

Read more ladies - In 2012 31% of the books I read had a female author. This year...49%. I haven't been making a conscious effort to read more women, but look how nicely that worked out.\r\n\r\n2. Read more non-white people - Last year 93% of the books I read were by white people. This year...93%. Dammit. Apparently that is my sweet spot. I need to work on this.\r\n\r\n3. Read more non-US authors - Last year 69% of the authors were from the US. This year...73%. Whoops. Also the only other nationality I read was British. So. I failed here.\r\n\r\n4. Go to more author signings - Didn't do this at all. Which is sad, but I can't say I came across any author signings that really got me excited. The local bookstore in town has lots of \"author\" signings and while I love the store itself, I put author in quotes for a reason, since most of these authors are actually reality stars that \"wrote\" books. I'm sure they have these people come because they draw bigger crowds but PLEASE throw an actual author in every once in a while.\r\n\r\n5. Get my review of The Parable of the Sower just written already - Hey, I did this. I mean, it was sort of clear that was going to happen. Still proud.\r\n\r\n6. Finish the Harry Potter readalong - Did this too, and it was AMAZING. I was actually going through some of the old HP posts when I found this goal one.\r\n\r\n7. Do a better job answering review requests - Worse. I have gotten much much worse at this.\r\n\r\n8. Read The Corrections - BAM! Completed. Take that, Franzy-pants.\r\n\r\n9. Listen to more audiobooks - I did this, but not so much with the whole running dealy. But I did a lot of the HP readalong via audiobooks and I've listened to the World War Z audiobook at least twice this year. Because yes, it's that good. I've also started listening to Welcome To Night Vale and if you guys haven't started listening to this as well, you're doing it wrong. I haven't started the running part at all, BUT we did get a stationary bike that I have been awesome at *pats self on back*. So I completed both parts of this goal, just separately.\r\n\r\n10. Do a better job reading the newspaper - Eh, I need to work on this one some more. I get the NYTimes on my iPad and iPhone in addition to getting it delivered every weekend, and yet I still usually focus on the magazine, real estate, and book reviews. I've gotten better at at least browsing through the other headlines.\r\n\r\nSo let's see. Overall I've done a worse job at reading more non-US people, going to more author signings, and answering review requests; stayed the same when it came to reading non-white people, listening to audiobooks, and reading the newspaper; got better at reading more ladies; managed to finish my Parable review, completed the HP readalong, AND read The Corrections, thanks to another readalong. Even though I failed or stayed the same at more than 1/2 of them, I'm not too upset. Probably because I'm (clearly) terrible at resolutions so I didn't really expect things to improve dramatically.\r\n\r\nShould I bother coming up with more resolutions/goals for 2014? Sure, why not?\r\n\r\n1. Keep reading female authors: I'm pretty happy with my stats from last year and I'll be happy to keep that up.\r\n\r\n2. Read more non-white people: ...yeah\r\n\r\n3. Read more non-US people: Again...yeah\r\n\r\n4. Post more often: I'd like to aim for about 3 posts a week. I haven't bee doing a great job with that the last...well for a good amount of 2013. So let's get better at that.\r\n\r\n4b. Not let so much time go by between reading and reviewing: Part of posting more would be not letting so much time (like a month+) go between reading and reviewing. Because while it's not a bad thing to let some time go between when I read and when I post to let the ideas stew, there's also the issue that I forget everything that happened in the book. Which makes for a pretty crappy review.\r\n\r\n5. Meet up with more book bloggers: I got a chance to meet up with Alice, Rayna, Emily, Amanda, and Kayleigh M. this year, which was awesome. More of that would be excellent.\r\n\r\nDo you have any bookish resolutions/goals for 2014?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:22:39+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:46:11+00:00","published_at":"2014-01-01T15:30:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd4ef5dde22fdb2000332","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532dd4ef5dde22fdb2000333","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532dd4ef5dde22fdb2000331","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Reading Goals","slug":"reading-goals","url":"/articles/tags/reading-goals"}]}]},{"id":"532d82945dde22aa7600017e","title":"End Of Year *Book Survey*","slug":"end-of-year-book-survey","url":"/articles/end-of-year-book-survey","body":"I saw a couple people doing the end of year book surveys (recently Loni, who got it from Jaimie) and decided hooray for surveys that allow me to get a post up without too much thought!\r\n\r\n![best-books-2013](/assets/best-books-2013.jpg) \r\n\r\n**Number of books read in 2013**: \r\n58. Unless I can finish re-reading Bryson's In A Sunburned Country before the end of year.\r\n\r\n**1. Best Book You Read In 2013?** \r\nThere were a lot of amazing books I read this year. I re-read Lamb by Christopher Moore and that's a favorite of mine so always good. But for new-to-me books of 2013 it would have to be Where'd You Go, Bernadette? by Maria Semple and I'm thinking even though I just read it a couple months ago, I need to read it again.\r\n\r\n**2. Book You Were Excited About & Thought You Were Going To Love More But Didn\u2019t?** \r\nThis is a toss up between Michael Cunningham's The Hours and Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I thought they'd be books that were right up my alley (haha, pun) and they didn't do it for me.\r\n\r\n**3. Most surprising (in a good way!) book of 2013? Where'd You Go, Bernadette?** \r\nBecause I didn't think I'd love it like I did. I don't know why I got it in my head this was going to be some pretentious book and instead it was SO GOOD\r\n\r\n**4. Book you read in 2013 that you recommended to people most in 2013?** \r\nI know I've tried to shove World War Z by Max Brooks down a lot of people's throats, but I first read that a few years ago so that isn't anything new. Bernadette was another one I kept telling people about, except most people already knew about it so breath wasted.\r\n\r\n**5. Best series you discovered in 2013?** \r\nOther than Harry Potter I don't think I read any series this year. And I had discovered HP awhile before. I guess Bridget Jones's Diary and Confessions of a Shopaholic are both the first in their respective series, but while I enjoyed those books \"eh\" to the series as a whole. Pre-emptive \"eh\" at least, since I haven't read them.\r\n\r\n**6. Favorite new author you discovered in 2013? This is a tough one. Joe Hill?** \r\nI read his book Horns and the book he wrote with his dad In the Tall Grass and those were awesome so I'm looking forward to reading more of his stuff. I don't know if he's a favorite author, but one I'm excited to read more of.\r\n\r\n**7. Best book that was out of your comfort zone or was a new genre for you?** \r\nI liked Breakfast at Tiffany's more than I was anticipating, although I was not a fan of the other short stories. Maybe True Grit as another book I enjoyed that is outside of my normal genres.\r\n\r\n**8. Most thrilling, unputdownable book in 2013?** \r\nThe Harry Potter books kept me enthralled. Of course, that's to be expected. Otherwise Alif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson had some good thrills in it.\r\n\r\n**9. Book You Read In 2013 That You Are Most Likely To Re-Read Next Year?** \r\nWhere'd You Go, Bernadette? since I already said I want to re-read it. I expect I'll probably re-read some more HP and perhaps Eleanor & Park. \r\n\r\n**10. Favorite cover of a book you read in 2013?** \r\nChuck Wendig's Blackbirds. I LOVE this cover. The book is very good as well.\r\n\r\n**11. Most memorable character in 2013?** \r\nCoraline from Coraline by Neil Gaiman. Or maybe Bernadette (I know, I'm talking a lot about it. Only because it's so great.)\r\n\r\n**12. Most beautifully written book read in 2013?** \r\nI think I'll have to go with The Kings and Queens of Roam by Daniel Wallace. That book had some beautiful imagery in it.\r\n\r\n**13. Book that had the greatest impact on you in 2013?** \r\nPossibly We Need To Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver, and not necessarily in a good way. The book is very good and well-written and gave me stress headaches while I was reading it because it's very upsetting. So yeah, impactful.\r\n\r\n**14. Book you can\u2019t believe you waited UNTIL 2013 to finally read?** \r\nBridget Jones's Diary because it seems like one a lot of people had already read. Or Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett which I'm sure teenage me would have loved.\r\n\r\n**15. Favorite Passage/Quote From A Book You Read In 2013?** \r\n[so, I have a lot of great passages highlighted in my Kindle. Which is not with me at the moment. So I'll fill this in later. Or more likely I'll forget, but know that I had intentions to fix this.]\r\n\r\n**16.Shortest and Longest Book You Read In 2013?** \r\nShortest: In The Tall Grass by Joe Hill and Stephen King at 62 pages.\r\nLongest: Under the Dome by Stephen King at 1,062 pages. Surprisingly Rowling was second longest, beating out George R.R. Martin. I also appreciate that King is both the shortest and longest book I read.\r\n\r\n**17. Book That Had A Scene In It That Had You Reeling And Dying To Talk To Somebody About It?** \r\nI'm thinking mostly the HP books, except since we did our SUPER EPIC READALONG I did get to talk to people about all the scenes. So that was sweet.\r\n\r\n**18. Favorite Relationship From A Book You Read In 2013 (be it romantic, friendship, etc).** \r\nI love Joshua & Biff's bromance from Lamb. Also Cath and Reagan from Fangirl (yeah yeah or Cath and Levi but whatever, I heart Reagan)\r\n\r\n**19. Favorite Book You Read in 2013 From An Author You\u2019ve Read Previously** \r\nNot counting re-reading books I had read before I guess I'll have to go with both Eleanor & Park and Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell, because I can never decide which Rowell I like best. (All of them. The answer is all of them.)\r\n\r\n**20. Best Book You Read In 2013 That You Read Based SOLELY on a Recommendation From Somebody Else:** \r\nTell the Wolves I'm Home by Carol Rifka Brunt. Once I get at least three recommendations from this group, I must read the book and they have excellent taste so this works out. Next is that time travel River something book that I'm sure I will fall in love with.\r\n\r\n**21. Genre You Read The Most From in 2013?** \r\nUmm. I dunno. I don't categorize my stuff into genres because it's too easy for something to fall into a bunch of genres and then I don't know what to do with it. So let's say the genre was \"excellent books\" and in which case, I read a lot of that.\r\n\r\n**22. Newest fictional crush from a book you read in 2013?** \r\nNone? Or Sirius still? I still love him.\r\n\r\n**23. Best debut book you read?** \r\nIs Bernadette the debut novel? Cos if so, that one.\r\n\r\n**24. Most vivid world/imagery in a book you read in 2013?** \r\nHP. Rowling wins at creating this world, even if she didn't quite figure out the details of wizarding plumbing.\r\n\r\n**25. Book That Was the Most Fun To Read in 2013?** \r\nMost of them. HP for the readalong. WWZ I loved listening to. Bernadette was hilarious.\r\n\r\n**26. Book That Made You Cry Or Nearly Cry in 2013?** \r\nI swear, I cry so much more easily now and I cried a lot. HP, Eleanor & Park, Tell The Wolves I'm Home. So amazing, even if it's a little soul destroying. But in a good way.\r\n\r\n**27. Book You Read in 2013 That You Think Got Overlooked This Year Or When It Came Out?** \r\nI read a lot of big name books so I'm not sure. Maybe Fledgling because Octavia Butler is in general overlooked\r\n\r\n**28. Did you complete any reading challenges or goals that you had set for yourself at the beginning of this year?** \r\nI don't set concrete challenges or goals because when I do that I fail. I am no good at forcing myself to read something. I guess a goal for the last few years has been to read The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen and with the help of a readalong I finally got that done. So hooray! Take that, Franzeeeeehhh.\r\n\r\n**29. Bookish Events on your blog in 2013?** \r\nThe HP and Corrections readalongs. Those were pretty great. I'd include the readathong but I'm pretty sure I managed like 20 pages so that didn't go so well.\r\n\r\n**30. One Book You Didn\u2019t Get To In 2013 But Will Be Your Number 1 Priority in 2014?** \r\nThat River book I mentioned above as one that I'm sure I'll like, even if I can't remember the name right now.\r\n\r\n**31. Book You Are Most Anticipating For 2014 (non-debut)?** \r\nRowell has a new book, Landline coming out, and I think 2014. So that will be fun.\r\n\r\n**32. One Thing You Hope To Accomplish Or Do In Your Reading/Blogging In 2014?** \r\nGet more consistent with my blogging. I've fallen behind a bit and I want to fix that. Of course my old laptop was a pain to use (overheated very easily, took about 20 min to start up, froze a lot) and Boyfriend+ got me a new computer because HE IS THE BEST EVERRRRR so I'm hoping this will help me blog some more.\r\n\r\n(P.S. I keep having on-and-off issues with the comments showing up. Not sure why, but there you go. They came back before and were around this morning so I'm hoping they'll just come back again.)","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T12:31:16+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:45:39+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-27T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532d82945dde22aa76000180","key":"book1","value":""},{"id":"532d82945dde22aa76000181","key":"citation","value":""}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532d82945dde22aa7600017f","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish survey","slug":"bookish-survey","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-survey"}]}]},{"id":"532d81485dde22aa76000176","title":"Pride and Prejudice: *Movie Battle*","slug":"pride-and-prejudice-movie-battle","url":"/articles/pride-and-prejudice-movie-battle","body":"After reading Bridget Jones's Diary I thought I'd give Pride and Prejudice a re-read. I'm not going to bother to review P&P here because I've already done it. And while that normally won't stop me from rehashing old points, but instead I figured I'd ask you guys a question.\r\n\r\nMy BJD post I mentioned I had recently watched the 2005 Kiera Knightly Pride & Prejudice and I figured this wouldn't be popular with people. But some people really don't like it. Or alternatively, some people just really like the 1995 Firth BBC mini-series Pride and Prejudice. So enlighten me\r\n\r\n![p&pf](/assets/p&pf.gif) \r\n\r\n1. Why is the Kiera Knightly one so awful?\r\n2. Why is the Colin Firth one the best thing ever?\r\n\r\nNot necessarily compared to one another, just separately, as their own movies, why do you think the mini-series is so much better? I mentioned this in my last post, but I haven't seen the mini-series one for a couple reasons. One being that it's loooooooong cos of the whole mini-series aspect and I have a short attention span. The second being a big draw for the '95 one seems to be \"Colin Firth, he's so dreamy\" and no. Sorry. Not that that is a bad reason to watch that one (I will totally watch the 2011 Jane Eyre even though that story makes me eye-rolly if only for Fassbender) but just because Firth = eh. Not as an actor. He's fine. But nothing there makes me want to go out of my way to see something he's been in.\r\n\r\nWhy do I like the 2005 one? I think it does a good job with the story. I think Kierna Knightly makes a good Lizzie one who knows and understands and (for the most part) follows the rules of propriety but she doesn't come off as stuffy or so overly formal that I don't believe her as a character. Brenda Bethyn's Mrs. Bennet is ridiculous in the right amounts, Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet tolerates his family with general amusement, which seems the only way to do it. Kelly Rielly's Caroline Bingly is manipulative and bitchy. Matthew Macfayden's Darcy is pompous and adorably awkward. Tom Hallander's Mr. Colin's is hilariously awkward and oblivious. And OF COURSE, Judi Dench nails Catherine de Bourg as pretentious and intimidating and terrible. The shots are pretty, it has humor, and it is true to the original text. I mean, almost down to many of the exact lines. Maybe the 2005 version is more modern in some senses but I'm not seeing that as a downside.\r\n\r\nSo tell me your answers to questions 1 and 2 up there. Or if you have any other points or movie versions I should mention. I'll updated this post to keep up with people's responses. And since a number of you already left thoughts on my last post, here are some of those:\r\n\r\n**Why is the Kiera Knightly one so awful?**\r\nMr. Darcy's head looks like a toe.\r\nSO MANY THINGS WRONG. Too much focus on the romance between Lizzie & Darcy instead of everything else. NO TO SWEEPING VIEWS OF NATURE AND DRAMATIC SCENES IN THE RAIN\r\nJena Malone (Kitty) is terrible. Knightly is fine. (Counterpoint comment: JENA MALONE IS GREAT WTF PEOPLE?)\r\n\r\n**Why is the Kiera Knightly one maybe not so bad?**\r\nThe family seems to actually act like a family. Feels natural.\r\n\r\n**Why is the Colin Firth one the best thing ever?**\r\nIt's longer so the characters are more developed.\r\nIt's focused on more than just the Lizzie/Darcy romance\r\nFirth had more personality than Macfayden.\r\nIt's the one I saw first so it's the definitive one in my head","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T12:25:44+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:45:13+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-23T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532d81485dde22aa76000179","key":"citation","value":""},{"id":"532de8495dde22143d000392","key":"books","value":"1885"}],"taxonomy":[{"id":"532d81485dde22aa76000177","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Jane Austen","slug":"jane-austen","url":"/articles/tags/jane-austen"},{"value":"movies","slug":"movies","url":"/articles/tags/movies"},{"value":"Pride and Prejudice","slug":"pride-and-prejudice","url":"/articles/tags/pride-and-prejudice"}]}]},{"id":"532d80ab5dde22143d000326","title":"How's your *love life*, anyway?","slug":"hows-your-love-life-anyway","url":"/articles/hows-your-love-life-anyway","body":"As I started to write this review I realized wow, I am way behind.

That's just taunting me to now take 3 months before I write a review.)\r\n\r\n![Bridget-Joness-Diary](/assets/Bridget-Joness-Diary.jpg) \r\n\r\nI picked up Bridget Jones's Diary on my way down to South Carolina for Thanksgiving. After re-reading Attachments and even Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? with it's section on how much Kaling likes rom-coms, I thought it was a good opportunity to check out this...I'll say classic rom-com. Plus I had recently re-watched Pride & Prejudice`1` so this seemed like a good choice. And hey guess what? It was. Good job, me.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that haven't read the book yet, or seen the movie, or somehow learned the plot via osmosis since it's been sort of a big deal for awhile, here's a plot synopsis.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of Pride and Prejudice but today.\r\n\r\nFine, a little more. Bridget Jones is keeping a diary (oh, you guessed that from the title? Well, good for you. Quit interrupting). She starts the book with her New Years resolutions. It's the typical stuff: drink less, quit smoking, lose weight, find a boyfriend. Or more accurately \"Form a functional relationship with a responsible adult.\" She starts each of her diary entries with how much she drank, ate, and smoked. She does as well as you'd assume one would do with New Years resolutions, which I liked because if she actually did a good job with her resolutions, especially long-term, I would side-eye her a lot. Her parents and their friends keep trying to set her up with Mr. Darcy (SEE, P&P) a super rich lawyer guy who wears bad sweaters. They don't really connect and instead Jones starts hooking up with her boss.\r\n\r\nThe novel is Bridget being a single woman over the age of thirty in London, which is apparently a BIG DEAL. Not so much to her, but MAN everyone in her family and their friends are constantly asking her why she's not married yet and she better hurry up (\"'You career girls! I don't know! Can't put it off forever, you know. Tick-tock-tick-tock.' 'Yes. How does a woman manage to get to your age without being married?'\") and I wanted to kick people for her. Of course then she complains about being a 130lbs and the \"terrifying slide into obesity\" so then I want to kick her too. SHIN KICKS FOR EVERYONE. But they're shin kicks out of love. She has her friends and embarrassing mishaps, like going to a thing called a \"tarts and vicars\" party (Which, what? This is a thing?) so she dresses as a tart and then turns out they decided last minute that it will just be a normal party, but my Bridget, what lovely dominatrix outfit.\r\n\r\nI know I said this in my Attachments review already, but rom-coms aren't typically my thing. But Bridget doesn't act by rom-com logic. She struggling through life in a general I-haven't-quite-figured-out-how-to-adult-yet way and she makes bad decisions, but they're hilarious. Especially her dinner party which might possibly be my favorite part, even when I was yelling 'No, you fool!! Not like that!\" Overall there are a lot of funny moments, without it being Sex in the City pun fiesta. Stuff like:\r\n\r\n> Tom has a theory that homosexuals and single women in their thirties have natural bonding: both being accustomed to disappointing their parents and being treated as freaks by society.\r\n\r\n> I have been waging a campaign on our street against car burglar alarms which are intolerable and counterproductive since you are more likely to get your car broken into by an angry neighbor.\r\n\r\nI liked this book and it was the perfect quick read that didn't require too much deep thinking. I know this is an obvious comparison, but it's along the lines of Confessions of a Shopaholic. I don't plan on rushing out and reading the other Bridget Jones books, but this was the perfect airport read.\r\n\r\n`1` The Kiera Knightly one and I KNOW some of you out there think this is blasphemous compared to the Colin Firth one except 1) I don't know why everyone has Knightly. She's fine. 2) I do not get the sexual attraction to Firth. Perhaps that would change if I did see his P&P (I didn't understand the wonder that is Benedict Cumberbatch until I finally watched Sherlock so it's possible). I'm sticking with my P&P thankyouverymuch.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T12:23:07+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:44:46+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-20T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532d80ab5dde22143d000329","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 11, location 149 | Fielding, Helen.

I was so excited to see the package and I sort of guessed it was her since it had the fancy Royal Mail stamp on the package.

AND a King book I don't have but have had in my sights for awhile so excited! I can always use more King in my life.\r\n\r\nNext up is some English chocolate because Laura taught me that it's not that I dislike milk chocolate, it's that I dislike American milk chocolate. I'm sorry for all of you who have fond memories of Hershey bars, but they taste terrible. This stuff however is delicious. I actually ate one of the chocolate coins before I even took this picture. Because it didn't fit nicely on the book or something.\r\n\r\nLastly is the \"Her?\" button. Laura included a note with the package and I started reading the note first, but each time she got to one of the items in the package, I had to open it.

Hooray for deals. One of those was Mindy Kaling's book Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? which I've wanted to read for awhile. Pretty much since I read Fey's Bossypants and thought \"Hell YES, I would like some more memoirs by hilarious ladies.\" But then I heard \"Kaling's book is good, but not as good as Fey's.\" Don't worry, Kaling heard this too:\r\n\r\n> This sounds okay, but not as good as Tina Fey's book. Why isn't this more like Tina Fey's book? \r\n\r\n> I know, man. Tina's awesome...Unfortunately I can't be Tina, because it's very difficult to lure her into a Freaky Friday-type situation where we could switch bodies, even though in the movies they make it look so easy. Believe me, I've tried.\r\n\r\nI can't tell if my version is updated to include this in the intro after the book came out, or if Kaling heard this so often when the book was in the early stages that it's been in here since the beginning. But really, it's unfair to try to go up against Tina Fey. But I was impressed because Kaling does a good job. Maybe because it's been years since I first read Bossypants so I didn't spend the whole time comparing them.\r\n\r\nJust like Fey's book, Kaling's is a memoir about her life growing up and when she eventually became a writer/actor/director(!) on The Office. It's what you expect in a memoir: she talks about growing up and being close with her parents, no matter how nerdy that made her, going to college (\"I went to Dartmouth to pursue my love of white people and North Face parkas\"), living in NYC and later LA, and throughout how much she looooooooooooves comedy.\r\n\r\nKaling is hilarious and I found myself thinking \"Kaling, be my FRIEEEEEEND\" a lot while reading this. Which I didn't expect just because Kaling is a lot peppier than I see myself. Even when I was reading about how much she loves romantic comedies, which are generally not my jam, I was thinking that she made some good points and I would be all for it hanging out and watching rom coms with her, even if I spent a large portion of the time making snarky remarks. But then she reveals how terrible she is with children and YUP, I hear you.\r\n\r\nI think my favorite parts came from when she was living in NYC, after college and before she started on The Office. I loved her talking about her friends, and the apartment they had (\"The staircase in our third-floor walk-up was the steepest, hardest, metal-est staircase I have ever encountered in my life. It was a staircase for killing someone and making it seem like an accident\"), and her trying to break into showbiz. She talks about when she tried out for a Broadway show called Bombay Dreams. Since she's Indian-American she fit their very-narrow demographic they were looking for. Except for the \"can dance\" part. She sums up the dancing part of her audition: \"It remains the single most embarrassing performance of my life, and it's on tape somewhere. I like to think Andrew Lloyd Webber watches it whenever he's feeling down.\" Plus the NYC section provides hilarious lines, like what it was like for her to live in the city in October 2001where you're torn between 9/11 and Sex and the City anxiety:\r\n\r\n> Should I keep a gas mask in my kitchen? Am I supposed to be able to afford Manolo Blahnik shoes? What is Barneys New York? You're trying to tell me a place called \"Barneys\" is fancy? Where are the fabulous gay friends I was promised? Gay guys hate me! Is this anthrax or powdered sugar? Help! Help!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this book more than I was expecting to. I mean, I was assuming I'd like it but I didn't think I'd laugh so much. I knew she was funny but I'd really only see Kaling on The Office. I wish I could see her stage show and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (where she and her friend played Matt and Ben and YES, DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE THAT?) This was a really funny, light, quick read. If I had to compare them, I still like Bossypants more but this isn't far behind.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T12:14:32+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:43:42+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-16T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532d7ea85dde22aa76000175","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from location 926 | Kaling, Mindy.

At least the start of a cold. Anyway I was up a good portion of the night with a sore throat that kept waking me up and this was after not getting a great night's sleep the night before so I'm at that fun point where lack of sleep turns into delirium. But since I'm writing a second review of a book I already reviewed on here awhile ago, I figured that's fine. \r\n\r\n![Attachments cover-1](/assets/Attachments cover-1.jpg) \r\n\r\nAfter finishing The Hours I needed something else to read but wasn't on the mood for anything on my TBR pile. I turned to a standby: Attachments by Rainbow Rowell. I have it on my Kindle so it's one of those books I tend to re-read bits and pieces of cos I often have a copy with me`1`. I hadn't so much be slowly re-reading this story as I was reading bits and pieces of it here and there. Jennifer and Beth's email exchanges are the best and you don't need a lot of context to enjoy them. But this time I decided I would actually re-read the whole thing. Hey, did you know the ENTIRE story is amazing and not just the email exchanges?\r\n\r\nI knew the whole story was great. But I knew it on the logical level. But whenever I would think back on the book it was the email exchanges I would remember the best with the rest of the story fading a bit. Which was stupid on me because I love all parts of this book. I love Lincoln's story, which before I liked but whenever there would be a Lincoln chapter all I could think was this meant I wouldn't be getting a Beth/Jennifer chapter. This time I knew the stories, I knew their email exchanges so I could focus on Lincoln and the larger story at hand. And it is so good. I forgot just how good it is and how much I love it and how this is a romantic comedy and even though I'm not usually crazy about those I LOVE THIS ONE. I think I figured out why this time around. The characters never do something incredibly stupid for the sake of moving the plot along.\r\n\r\n*some spoilers but you probably should have read this book already. You're lucky I'm even bothering with this spoiler message*\r\n\r\nMindy Kaling talks about romantic comedy logic and essentially how there isn't any but you sort of just have to go with it. But where she loves it (\"I simply regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which the world created therein has different rules than my regular human word.\")`2` I hate just going with it. One of the biggest things I hate is when there's a love triangle and one of the guys is CLEARLY AN ASSHOLE and the hero is who the girl should end up with but there's all this fake tension about who she'll choose. Except no, there is no tension, the choice is obvious. \r\n\r\nAttachments has a love triangle and it almost fits into this basic structure. Lincoln is the main character so we're on his side. Beth's boyfriend seems like kind of a douche and Lincoln seems like he would make a great boyfriend so OBVIOUSLY they should be together. Except we see moments where Beth's boyfriend isn't a raging douche. And we understand why Beth is with him and why he's with Beth. And also we have no idea what the chemistry would be between Beth and Lincoln because they don't talk to one another until the very end of the book. I mean we KNOW they're going to be awesome together, and we want them to get together, but I didn't spend the whole time rolling my eyes going \"No, you know what lady? Just stay with your obviously terrible boyfriend who even you can't come up with redeeming qualities for.\" Instead I spent my time going \"YES, THIS IS GREAT! HOW DID I FORGET HOW GREAT THIS IS?\"\r\n*spoilers contained. But you should probably just read the book. and hang your head in shame for not having read it yet.*\r\n\r\nThis is the joy of re-reading. I can go back and focus on new parts of the story that I skipped the first time around. Of course I still LOOOOOOVED the email exchanges because while I have come to appreciate the awesomeness of the whole book, these are still the best and if Rowell felt like writing an entire book about just these two, I would be for it.  \r\n\r\nOne thing Rowell hasn't made any easier is helping me decide which of her books I like best. Everything I think \"Attachments is my favorite\" I remember something awesome that happens in Eleanor & Park and Fangirl and I continue to go round and round in circles. So to be safe you should probably just read them all. Clearly. \r\n\r\n`1` Moranthology by Caitlin Moran is another good \"pick up whenever\" book.\r\n`2` I realize I've included a quote from a book I haven't even reviewed yet but 1) Kaling's book is awesome and 2) it works so well right here.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T12:00:29+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:43:12+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-12T15:31:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532d7d9c5dde2289f6000001","key":"citation","value":"Rowell, Rainbow.

Of course that happened long before I started this blog, and thus long before I was on top of new books coming out, so it sort of makes sense. For awhile now the book has been in my periphery. It was a gook that I wanted to try and figured I would like, but never enough to go out looking for it. Then it was on sale and I love those.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's been awhile since I read this (I am real far behind on reviews) which means I can't remember a lot of the book. On the other hand, that's a good indication on how I felt about the book.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you probably know the plot, but just in case, it's about three different women all connected in some way by Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. The first is Virginia Woolf who is writing the book, the second is Laura Brown, a 1950s suburban housewife who is reading the book, and Clarissa Vaughn, nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway, who is throwing a party for her friend/living out the story. The three women aren't completely happy with their lives. We know what happened to Virginia Woolf. And even if you didn't, the book starts with her suicide, so now you know. Spoiler, I guess. Laura feels trapped by her life and is possibly in love with a neighbor. Clarissa's best friend and dear love is dying of AIDS.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing about the story. I liked it enough while I was reading it. For the most part it kept me engaged. For the most part. But when I put the story down, it was an effort to pick it back up again. Because overall, I didn't care too much. There were nice moments. The writing was beautiful. I really wanted to like it. And I didn't dislike the story. I just nothing-ed it. Perhaps if I had written this not long after I finished reading it I'd have more to say. Maybe. But it's been awhile and I got nothing.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the movie. I have hope that I'll like the movie more than the book. I don't really know why I think that. That's not true. Both Meryl Streep and Allison Janney are in the movie, so already we're starting in a good place.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T11:29:40+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:41:53+00:00","published_at":"2013-12-09T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532de7815dde22143d00038f","key":"books","value":"11899"},{"id":"532de7815dde22143d000390","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 9 | Cunningham, Michael.

Puccini is a terror, but an adorable terror so he gets away with a lot. Clyde could get away with a lot too, if he tried, cos he's sort of the favorite (and the oldest and THE BEST ONE). But he's pretty well behaved. As long as you're not a squirrel, cat, or bird. If you're an animal smaller than him, you better be faster cos otherwise you'll be a snack. There are also 3 cats (one of them saved from the outside and the wrath of Clyde) but I only saw them briefly (they mostly hide in the master bed room) so I have no pictures of them.

She discusses the history of the U.S. during the time right before and after the murders. I realize this sounds like a downer of a topic, but if you're already familiar with Vowell you know this is not the case. If you're not already familiar with her, know that she refers to Robert Todd Lincoln as Jinxy McDeath, as he was present in some capacity at all three assassinations.<br /><br />I think my favorite way to learn is to be tricked into it. Bill Bryson does a good job with this. So does Vowell, who I would consider very similar to Bryson, albeit in different topics and she cites more sources. AV focused more on her travels around the country to visit the various sites of the assassinations, see the relics leftover, etc. I think this is why I enjoyed this one more than WS, because her talking about her travels are the funniest parts. Besides, this means her young nephew Owen gets to be a character, and he's adorable. I mean, he calls cemeteries \"Halloween parks\" because adorable. Also because he's a small child whose aunt keeps bringing him to \"Halloween parks\" so she can visit the graves of various famous historical figures. Plus we get lots of awkward stories about her traveling like when she's at a B&amp;B sitting at breakfast with a bunch of strangers and suddenly starts going on about presidential assassins and the musical she recently saw. As she describes:<br /><br />Now, a person with sharper social skills than I might have noticed that as these folks ate their freshly baked blueberry muffins and admired the bed-and-breakfast's teapot collection, they probably didn't want to think about presidential gunshot wounds. But when I'm around strangers, I turn into a conversational Mount St. Helens. I'm dormant, dormant, quiet, quiet, old-guy loners build log cabins on the slopes of my silence and then, boom, it's 1980. Once I erupt, they'll be wiping my verbal ashes off their windshields as far away as North Dakota.<br /><br />It's her humor that gets me through a topic I can't imagine I would read about otherwise. Not unless forced anyway. I feel like just typing that pains certain friends of mine, but American history is not exactly my favorite subject. Hence needing tricked into learning. Vowell brings a human element to a subject that I've mostly experienced through textbooks. She describes how Booth timed his shot during a joke in the play, so at least \"the bullet hit Lincoln mid-guffaw\". She describes the man who tended to Booth's ankle, broken when he jumped down to the stage after shooting Lincoln, Mudd and even goes to visit the Caribbean prison he was kept in for his part in the assassination. See, now that's dedication.<br /><br />She spends the most time on Lincoln, but of course there's the most information there. Garfield and McKinley weren't really considered martyrs at their deaths the way Lincoln was at his. Of course it could also be the matter that I know more of Lincoln anyway, so I'm just remembering there being more of that. However I do like the knowledge that Garfield was sort of a slacker, or at least preferred reading to most other things, including running the country. Maybe not the greatest trait in a president, but still.<br /><br />When I look back over all the sections I highlighted, I realize the majority of them aren't about the presidents. A few are about Owen (cos adorable) and the others are mostly things like \"You know you've reached a new plateau of group mediocrity when even a Canadian is alarmed by your lack of individuality.\" OK, so maybe I didn't learn all that much. I'm sure I'd still fail a test on the topic, but that's fine. It would just give me an excuse to read this again.<br /><br />I'll need to give Unfamiliar Fishes a try now.<br /><br />And I just looked at that post and realized I said pretty much the same thing about knowing of Sarah Vowell because I am repetitive. Let's consider it a quirk instead of a fault so I don't have to go back and rewrite those first sentences. <br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I said this in the last review too. Quirk, remember?<br /><br />Title quote from page 1, location 100","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:41+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:41+00:00","published_at":"2013-11-25T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ded5dde22fdcf00048e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Sarah Vowell","slug":"sarah-vowell","url":"/articles/tags/sarah-vowell"},{"value":"Assassination Vacation","slug":"assassination-vacation","url":"/articles/tags/assassination-vacation"}]}]},{"id":"53224ded5dde226419000561","title":"We say motherhood is important, but we sure don't act that way","slug":"we-say-motherhood-is-important-but-we-sure-dont-act-that-way","url":"/articles/we-say-motherhood-is-important-but-we-sure-dont-act-that-way","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Why-Have-Kids_300dpi.jpg\" />I've wanted to check out some more Jessica Valenti since I read her book <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/boston-book-festival-full-frontal\">Full Frontal Feminism</a> a zillion years ago.g I have a few of her books on my TBR list and it turned out Why Have Kids was on sale one day, so I went with that one. Many of my reading choices are based on what's cheap at the moment.<br /><br />I only somewhat remember Full Frontal Feminism at this point, but I'm still pretty confident in saying Why Have Kids is better.<br /><br />Despite the title of this book, it isn't really a discussion on why one should or shouldn't have kids. The subtitle A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness is much more accurate. But it's less of an attention-grabby title, so I understand why they went with what they did. Valenti talks about her experiences being a mother and how the culture of motherhood is deeply flawed. Not that being a mother is a bad thing or a negative thing but the deification of mothers is bad for women because it suggests the ONLY way a woman can be worthy is if she's a mother.<br /><br />She argues this isn't only a problem for women who have no interest in becoming a mother and having society pity them and tell them \"you'll change your mind\" and other very patronizing things, because man, society can be terrible.<br /><br />She talks about how the whole idea that \"mothers have the hardest, most rewarding, most important job in the world\" is a way to tell women \"the most important thing you can do is be a mother, so maybe don't worry so much about having a different career. Or at least don't worry about being paid so little for other work. I mean, that's not your true calling anyway.\"<br /><br />She also talks about how the problem extends even to those women who want to be mothers, who are mothers, and who discover that being a mother isn't the key to ultimate happiness that they were promised.<br /><br />She talks about how many laws do everything possible to protect the rights of the fetus while simultaneously ignoring the rights of the woman. How sometimes the woman is ignored as a person even when she's not pregnant because she could possibly become pregnant.<br /><br />The book talks about a lot of things that make me rage-y, but that's sort of the point going into this book. You know with Valenti you're going to get feminist rants. That's why you're reading the book to begin with. The biggest argument Valenti makes is that motherhood is not the end-all-be-all. It's not necessarily going to be the most important thing you do. And that's OK, and it doesn't mean you love your kids any less, and the fact that this even needs to be affirmed shows how much of a problem this is.<br /><br />I highlighted a lot of this book and in what seems to be a theme here, I'm going to share a few of these quotes with you.<br /><br />Parents expect their children to be their soul mates in the same way they expect of their spouse-they want children to make their lives and families complete. When these sweet little beings who are supposed to be the center of parents' universe don't manage to fulfill their lives completely, we come back to the most overwhelming sentiment of mothers across America: guilt.<br /><br />The sentiment that women overwhelmingly hear is that if we don't think parenting is the most difficult thing we've ever done, if we don't find it exhausting and draining and killing our sex lives...well, we're doing it wrong.<br /><br />How insulting is it to suggest that the best thing women can do is raise other people to do incredible things? I'm betting some of those women would like to do some great things of their own.<br /><br />Overall a book I really enjoyed, despite the rage-y-ness. Because of the rage-y-ness? Both. I've been trying to figure out who I'd recommend this book to: women who want to have kids? are unsure if they want to have kids? know they don't want kids? I dunno, all of that, plus guys? Yeah, I think that last one works. It's an interesting take on the concept of motherhood in current American (and mostly Western) society.<br /><br />OK, it was like 3 years ago. But in internet years that's roughly a zillion. Also I apologize that my review for it isn't really a review but like 3 sentences mentioning that I read it and that I like the quote \"Keepers of the all-powerful hymen.\" It really is a good quote, so not a total waste.<br /><br />There was recently a Guardian article titled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/18/sorry-but-being-a-mother-is-not-the-most-important-job-in-the-world\">\"Sorry, but being a mother is not the most important job in the world\"</a> which goes over many of the same ideas, and you should probably read this as well.<br /><br />Title quote from page 65, location 1044<br /><br />Valenti, Jessica.

Laura reviewed not this book but a <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2013/07/fifth-avenue-5-am-audrey-hepburn-and.html\">book sort of about this book,</a> which at least reminded me BoT was something I wanted to check out at some point. Then it was on sale. I'm sure that's what did it.<br /><br />Going into this book I knew pretty much nothing about it. Or I guess actually I knew this<br /><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F64eiQBRjSQ/UomBPC8xCqI/AAAAAAAADNo/1a2EEyEQmqQ/s1600/AHBoT.jpeg\" />And nothing else. Not the context of this image, nothing other than \"Hey, I've seen this image forty million times before and know it's from Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" And according to Laura's post this image barely has anything to do with the movie but was mostly promotional stuff that Tiffany's made her do in exchange for letting them film in their store. Oh, and I know that song by Deep Blue Something. Neither of these things really give you any clue what the story is about. Not that I think that's necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/breakfast_at_tiffanys.large.jpg\" />In case you'd like to know what it's about, here's the plot. Narrator (Holly just calls him Fred after her brother and we never learn his actual name) and the bartender Joe are talking about a picture they've found in a newspaper. A man in Africa has created a sculpture of a woman that looks just like Holly Golightly, whom neither of them have seen in years. And then \"Fred\" tells us about meeting and befriending Holly, who I am pretty sure is the first manic-pixie dream girl. Except she actually has some depth, so that's fun.<br /><br />Holly is...I think just calling her a prostitute isn't quite right. I suppose she's closer to an escort. She's a society girl who entertains wealthy men, who buy her things and give her money. Her goal is to marry one of them some day. Sex is implied, it's certainly not shied away from, but it's never discussed outright.<br /><br />There isn't too much that happens, now that I think about it. She and \"Fred\" hang out, she throws parties, another society girl/escort moves in with her for awhile, she and \"Fred\" fight, she disappears. There's slightly more that happens, but really, it seems so secondary to the point of the novella, which is just learning about Holly Golightly. Except Holly really doesn't want you to know who she is or where she came from.<br /><br />What really makes the story is the language. The only other Capote I've ever read is In Cold Blood, which has a very different subject in mind. Here are some of the quotes I particularly enjoyed<br /><br />She was never without dark glasses, she was always well groomed, there was a consequential good taste in the plainness of her clothes, the blues and grays and lack of luster that made her, herself, shine so. <br /><br />I knew damn well I'd never be a movie star. It's too hard; and if you're intelligent, it's too embarrassing.<br /><br />\"You know those days when you've got the mean reds?\"<br />\"Same as the blues?\"<br />\"No,\" she said slowly. \"No, the blues are because you're getting fat or maybe it's been raining too long. You're sad, that's all. But the mean reds are horrible. You're afraid and you sweat like hell, but you don't know what you're afraid of. except something bad is going to happen, only you don't know what it is.\"<br />(\"Fred\" calls this angst. And he says it in a really dismissive way, because \"Fred\" kind of sucks.)<br /><br />\"Everybody has to feel superior to somebody,\" she said. \"But it's customary to present a little proof before you take the privilege.\"<br /><br />There was a plot point in the novella I was not expecting. It is sort of a spoiler so if you haven't read the book, I would recommend avoiding this section. I haven't seen the movie so I have no idea how they handle it, if at all.<br />gspoilers<br />This mysterious man seems to be stalking Holly and when \"Fred\" confronts him he tells \"Fred\" that he's actually her husband and her name is Lulamae and they got married when she was going on fourteen and oh, he was a middle aged man then with children just about her age and WHAT THE FUCK? And you know what \"Fred\" does? He BRINGS THIS GUY RIGHT TO HOLLY. Because \"Fred\" sucks. Holly ran away from this guy when she was little, the guy tells \"Fred\" this, and instead of thinking \"Hmm this middle aged guy married a child. That's messed up\" he thinks \"I must return this man to his wife\" or some other bullshit.<br /><br />THEN later Holly says something about how she's only ever had eleven lovers not counting anything that happened before she was thirteen and OMG HOLLY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? You never find out. Which I think is better cos if they really delved into that this would be a very different book. So I'm sort of torn between really wishing there was a prequel or something about Holly, and then just wanting there to be more hints in the text but nothing official.<br />spoilers over<br /><br />There were three other stories included with Breakfast at Tiffany's but they're...eh. I read them because I wanted to say I finished the book but I can hardly remember two of them and the last one I can't remember at all. But that's ok because Breakfast at Tiffany's was worth it over the other stories. Now I just need to see the movie.<br /><br />Title quote from page 17, location 210<br /><br />Capote, Truman.

Of course a few of the nights so far I have done things, which also gets in the way of doing blog stuff as I am out doing things and not home.

It's taking me awhile to get around and review things which means while I read the scary books during October, I'm not posting stuff about them until November. And now is the time to be talking about turkey stuff or something. Though since this would involve selecting books I'm going to read ahead of time, this probably won't happen.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/in-the-tall-grass-ebook.jpg\" />So anyway. Review. October was nearing the end and I didn't feel I'd read enough season-appropriate books so I was on the lookout when <a href=\"http://kfmurphy.blogspot.com/2013/10/short-story-reviews-ur-by-stephen-king.html\">Kayleigh wrote a post</a> that included a review for a Stephen King/Joe Hill collaboration. I had read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/the-language-of-sin-was-universal\">Horns</a> not long before (again, see the planning thing and that was from Kayleigh cos she dictates my Hill reading, apparently) and was happy to try out some more. Besides this sounded extra creepy and I really wanted to see what these two could come up with when they join forces. I was not disappointed. Well, there was a little disappointment. See this is a short story, which I knew going into it, BUT STILL, when I got to the end I was like \"OK, so could you guys go back and make that a full novel, kthxbai.\"<br /><br />Siblings Cal and Becky are driving through the middle of no where somewhere in Kansas. While passing through what looks like a sea of grass they hear a little boy yelling for help. Being the good people that they are they decide to wade into this tall grass and try to find the kid. Of course there's also a second voice telling them to stay away, telling the kid to quit calling to them, that he'll hear them.<br /><br />It seemed so simple. Go into the grass, find the little boy, get back out. But is it that simple? It's so easy to lose your way in this grass that is well over 6 feet tall. And it seems like someone you thought was right next to you one minute turns out to be several meters away the next. And who's this person that second voice is afraid will find them?<br /><br />I plowed through this story. I didn't realize until I went to write this that I hadn't even highlighted any lines I liked. And it's not that there weren't good lines, it was just that there was no time to stop and highlight something. THINGS ARE HAPPENING!<br /><br />I can't say too much because I don't want to spoil anything. But you should read this. I mean, it's short so even if it ends up not being your thing you haven't wasted much time. Unless you don't like scary things. Maybe stay away from it then. But otherwise, yeah, check it out.<br /><br />I'm going to get all of you to start watching this channel. Just wait.<br /><br />Title quote from location 50<br /><br />Hill, Joe and Stephen King.

I thought I should fix that and people have been saying lots of good things about Coraline AND it's a children's story so it's on the short side so it seemed like a good choice. Bookish internet, you have such good taste.<br /><br />I know I've called it a children's story, but it is a seriously creepy story. Coraline recently moved with her parents to a new home in a once mansion/now apartment building. There are no other children around and only so much entertainment she can get from the elderly (and slightly crazy) neighbors. Her parents work from home but they both work from home and are too busy to play with her. One day she finds a door in the drawing room, but when her mother opens it it just leads to a brick wall. Until one day Coraline opens the door herself and there's a hallway that leads to a replica of her family's apartment. It's complete with Other Mother, a woman who seems to be just like Coraline's mother except she has big black buttons instead of eyes. She and other father want Coraline to say with them.<br /><br />Things in the Other Flat seem nice at first. I mean, except for the fact that everyone has buttons instead of eyes. But things moved from unsettling to creepy to sinister pretty quickly. Ghosts and monsters and of course Other Mother wants Coraline to stay with her. Forever.<br /><br />It's a modern fairy tale. In a way. There are no princesses but there are quests to complete and monsters to overcome. And Coraline is just the right heroine. She's a child, but not a precocious one. She seems like a real child. She's brave and she's scared. She wants to go exploring. There's a quote early on that sums up Coraline nicely<br />There was also a well. On the first day Coraline's family moved in, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made a point of telling Coraline how dangerous the well was, and they warned her to be sure she kept away from it. So Coraline set off to explore for it, so that she knew where it was, to keep away from it properly.<br /><br />I haven't (yet) seen the movie version of this, but just from reading it I'm pretty sure they picked the perfect medium. This feels like it was made for stop-motion animation, especially done by the same team that did Nightmare Before Christmas. Even when it's about cheerful things stop motion has an eerie quality to it.<br /><br />This was the perfect Halloween read and it was short enough to finish in about an hour. I've had mixed feelings about Gaiman. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/if-you-can-fake-sincerity-youve-got-it\">American Gods</a> was not my thing but I loved <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/thats-how-it-goes-you-think-youre-on\">Good Omens</a>. So I went into Coraline unsure of what I'd be getting. I knew people had very good things to say about it. But so far the only Gaiman work I liked involved having Terry Pratchett at the wheel as well. After this book I trust Gaiman if a) he's writing with someone else or b) if he's writing a children's story.<br /><br />In <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/top-character-names-i-love-and-few\">the names post</a> I mentioned I liked the name Coraline so much because it's like Caroline except twisted. It's a simple change that makes the name so fresh. And guess what? Gaiman came up with the name because he mistyped Caroline, and what a lovely mistake.<br /><br />Title quote from page 3<br /><br />Gaiman, Neil. Coraline.

It's still a book I'm confident I could mention in a crowded room and most people would give me blank looks. It's a strange feeling. I know there is talk about the internet world versus the real world, but whenever I'm actually smack dab in an example of it I realize how true it is. Which segues nicelyg into the plot of Alif.<br /><br />Alif is a hacker of sorts. He's a programmer who is happy to work with anyone online to hide their identity and keep their business safe. He'll work with revolutionaries from all sides of the political spectrum. This does not make him especially popular with the local government who want to find him and his friends and shut them down. He lives...somewhere in the middle east. The city is unnamed so it's just not me being oblivious (thought I forgive you for thinking that as I had to confirm it myself). Alif has a failed relationship with a rich lady and in an attempt to completely cut her out of his life he writes a program that will recognize her. Not just her handle or her IP address, something that  seems to go even beyond recognition in how she writes so he can make sure he will never accidentally run into her online and she will never have to \"see\" him. Of course this software is powerful and when the antagonist know as The Hand gets ahold of it, Alif's online friends are in danger. So first we have a techno thriller set in a dystopian (though set in the real world present) city.<br /><br />But the book doesn't open with Alif. It opens thousands of years ago as a man takes down the stories from a captured jinn to wrote the Alf Yeom. This book is supposed to have strange powers, though it's considered no more than a legend in modern day. So we have these supernatural elements. I was thrown at first by the opening of the book because I was expecting the story above. What is this about genies and jinn and ancient texts? But when I shut up and just went with it, it worked so well.<br /><br />There are also scenes where the characters discuss religion and spirituality and morality and modern technology that work well within what's really a face paced story. I never felt bogged down by these moments or like someone was getting on a soap box. If nothing else it made me rethink my opinions and assumptions on the hijab.<br /><br />And the book is funny. Or, OK, it's not exactly a laugh out loud riot but it has a lot of funny moments.<br /><br />I'm struggling with what else to say about this book without spoiling anything. Also it's been awhile since I read it. I can't believe I forgot to review Alif the Unseen. Or, I guess I didn't forget to review it so much as I had written down notes for Quiet and then when I was like \"Hmm I should probably write a review\" I saw those notes and figured that's where I last left off. But please, do not take my lack of organization to mean anything bad about Alif. I was sucked into the story, worried for the characters, if they would get out of this peril while also moved by some of the stories and discussions they had.<br /><br />To make up for the fact that this review is short, and due to the fact that looking through my highlights makes me realize how many great quotes there are, here's a few of them for you to enjoy<br /><br />\"She can't quite see me as I am,\" [Vikram, a jinn] said. \"It's an American quirk. Half in, half out. A very spiritual people, but in their hearts they feel there is something shameful about the unseen.<br /><br />\"All translations are made up,\" opined Vikram, \"Languages are different for a reason. You can't move ideas between them without losing something. The Arabs are the only ones who've figured this out. They have the sense to call non-Arabic versions of the Criterion interpretations, not translations.\"<br /><br />\"For God also tells us that when you perform an action you believe to be a sin, it still counts as a sin even if it is proven to be permissible. Conscience. Conscience is the ultimate measure of man.\"<br /><br />And totally unintentionally. I'm not that clever.<br /><br />Title quote from page 108, location 1616<br /><br />Wilson, G. Willow.

The cos it's October there was the demand for Halloween style books. Except I realized I didn't have too many I hadn't re-read recently so...I just re-read some more. I also got all thrown off at some point and forgot to review a book, so the Alif the Unseen review will becoming eventually.

This is it. The final Corrections readalong post. We did it! Even when it wasn't that fun or when there was talking poo or Chip (and Gary and Caroline) being the worst. But that's OK, because if nothing else, we didn't let Franzypants beat us. WE WIN<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/confettiface.gif\" />OK, notes from this final section. Here we go<br /><br />We are getting our Christmas. Enid isn't quite getting the Christmas she wanted because Caroline is terrible. Just the worst. First she refuses to see her in-laws. Then she convinces the two older kids not to go. When the youngest Jonah wants to go and is all excited, she and the older siblings spend the weeks leading up to Christmas talking about how stupid and lame St. Jude is. THEN, the coup d'etat, she buys tickets to see The Lion King on Broadway for Christmas. But you know, Jonah can't go if he's in St. Jude and OMG CAROLINE, WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PERSON.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jstewangry.gif\" /><br />I started to feel bad for Gary in this section. I already pitied him from his other section and when we learn just how awful Caroline is, I felt it again for the guy. He was nice enough to tell Enid Jonah was sick instead of how his mother is a manipulative bitch. And that was officially the last nice thing Gary did during his visit to St. Jude and shit, Gary, you're making Chip look good. His shit about how illness is low-class (whatnow?), him making a big deal about installing the handle in the shower for his dadg, demanding his mom pay him back for the $4 bolts he had to buy, him going on about how trains are his hobby and not a hobby someone else picked out for him, except he picked the darkroom hobby and got bored with it when Caroline got him his own darkroom because he's a child, just like his kids, his fight Christmas morning.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/canteven.gif\" />Gary, shut up. You're terrible. Now I'm glad you're stuck with Caroline.<br /><br />Denise is still hovering somewhere on the terrible-fence. She's being a bitch to Robin in part to drive Robin away, in part because she knows Robin won't leave no matter how badly she treats her. So obviously that's Denise being terrible and fitting in with everyone else. But she also really cares about her parents. She's patient with them. She helps her father with his stretches and deals with his incontinence. She's even patient with Enid. And we learn that the reason Alfred quit his job right before getting the bigger pension was because he found out about her and Don however many years before and wasn't going to let Don drag Denise's name through the mud. That was the most (only?) touching moment in the whole book. Denise ends this being in limbo. She does some really awful things but overall she's not the terrible-person-to-the-core like her siblings seem to be.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/lowerexpectations.gif\" /><br />I skimmed Chip's Lithuania pages. I don't try to but I just can't focus on it. I could however focus when the cops (or whatever) stole Chip's clothes cos he was head-to-toe in leather and haha Chip. But he does manage to make it to St. Jude for Christmas morning. Right when Gary is leaving which pisses Gary off but Gary has stolen the torch for worst Lambert child, so whatever. Gary can be pissed. Because it turns out Chip has stopped being all that terrible. Not completely redeemed but he stays in St. Jude to help take care of his dad after he's moved to the nursing home. OK, so Denise sort of makes him do this at first, but he seems to keep doing it of his own volition. Then he moves to Chicago and even gets married. I hope he doesn't ruin her computer keyboards. And I hope he leaves his stupid vaginal-tang chair behind in NYC. He at least seems to have failed to replace his leather pants so we're moving in the right direction.<br /><br />We see a little bit more how difficult life is for Enid having to take care of Alfred. Once Alfred is in the nursing home, and then later dead, we see how much more relaxed Enid is. She refuses to pay Gary back for those bolts on principle (the principle being Gary is an asshole) and anytime he brings them up she points to his various expensive toys. Not in a \"you've spent so much on your watch\", but in a \"My, what a lovely new watch you have Gary\" and BAM, SHUT THAT DOWN.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/what-boom.gif\" />She even decided her friend Bea sucks and she doesn't want to be friends with her anymore and even stands up for gay rights. Enid gets her happy ending.<br /><br />The story pretty much ends with Alfred dies and everyone is much happier. You know, end this on a high note.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/lifeispointless.gif\" /><br />I'm not going to run out and read more Franzen right away, but I'm very happy that I didn't hate this. And more than that I'm happy we did this as a readalong, cos there is no way I would have made it through without everyone else. And the gifs. Always the gifs.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/franzeeeeeh.jpg\" /><br /><br /><link href=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/styles/default.css\" media=\"all\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/loc_en.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/opt_defaults.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/misterlinky.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/autolink.php?mode=standard&amp;owner=whatredread&amp;postid=01Nov2013\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script> <br />Which by the way is TOTALLY an easy thing to do.

Not in an obnoxious \"Oh I don't even SEE book covers. I really go for what's in the story\" because that's lame, and people who say they're color blind to race are lying liars.g It's more like \"I am pretty oblivious so unless the cover really wows me I have already forgotten it\". BUT I still wanted a Halloween post and I figured this would be a good opportunity to link to a bunch of old posts I wrote about horror stories. It's like the blogger equivalent of a clip show.

Think of how bad Twilight was. This is the exact opposite of that.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/he-realized-with-no-little-sense-of\">A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore</a> What happens if a beta male becomes death (not big d Death, but sort of a worker for the guy)? I like Moore's books. A lot. And this is one of his best ones. PLUS it takes place in the same universe as the vampire stories. There's even a scene that shows up in both books, but from different points of view. So yeah, you should probably just read them all and be covered.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/im-dead-but-its-not-so-bad-ive-learned\">Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion</a> It's all about zombies BUT it's not a scary story.

It's written straight. BUT I mean, it's still Lincoln, the president, slaying vampires. So yeah, I'm gonna keep it in this category.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/survival-is-key-word-to-remember\">The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks</a> Another borderline book is this survival guide. Again, it's written straight and there is some actual general survival tips here. But still, bookstores categorize it as humor, so I will as well. Though I know in an interview Brooks said he disagrees with this organization.<br /><br /><u>Classic horror stories </u><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/releasethebutterfly.gif\" /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/world-is-full-of-obvious-things-which\">The House of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> This one is all about atmosphere.

It's a collection of short stories, and even if you don't find yourself a short story fan, give King's a try. Some in here are very scary, some will keep you on the edge of your seat, some will make you laugh. If you can only pick one, \"1408\" is one of my favorite short stories ever. So yeah, I recommend it.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/you-might-understand-that-all-joy-has\">Full Dark, No Stars by Stephen King</a> Another collection of King short stories. Not quite as good as the Everything's Eventual group, but still good. And like EE it's a mixture.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/couldnt-plant-nothing-here-but-corpses\">Pet Semetary by Stephen King</a> Horror. Straight horror, done well.

I've read it twice. I've listened to the audiobook twice. I just finished listening to it for the second time this year, and I was very tempted to start it over again when the last track played. I had more zombie nightmares when I read it. Not sure if reading is a more personal experience or if by the time I listened to it I already knew the stories so well they didn't affect me in the same way.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/a-true-zombie-would-be-mine-forever\">Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates</a> This goes in the same pile as American Psycho for \"books I wish I could Eternal Sunshine out of my head\".

JCO can get under your skin.<br /><br />So there you go. Halloween reads that probably would have made better suggestions if I had made them before Halloween. So just keep them in mind for next year.<br /><br />Not actual color blind people. They're probably not lying. <br />I'm sure I've made this joke before too. This whole post is full of recycled bits.

I wanted to learn more about introverts and extroverts. I was intrigued by the idea of outgoing introverts and shy extroverts. I'd seen a number of positive reviews and it's one of those books I kept seeing people reading on the subway, so it seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />The book opens with a story about a lawyer named Laura. Laura is an introvert and as a typical introvert, she isn't comfortable in confrontational situations. But as a lawyer she's sometimes has to deal with these. She's leading a negotiation for her client and the lawyer she's up against is confrontational. She's loud, she makes demands, and she won't back down. At first Laura thinks she can't do this, but then she remembers her strengths and she's able to remain calm and she's well-prepared, while the other side is blustering and arrogant (and probably kind of stupid, though this is only implied).  Eventually they're able to come to an agreement and everyone is super impressed with Laura. Her clients are very happy with her, the opposing lawyer is so impressed she offers her a job with her firm, and the other clients decided Laura was the best lawyer ever and want HER firm to represent them. See how great introverts are? Then, in a Shymalanian twist, the Laura in this story is actually Susan Cain, author of the book. WHAAAA? I hear you saying. And then I eye-rolled hard. It's not that I disbelieve her (though I'm a bit skeptical with how awesome everyone thought Laura/Susan was) or that this is so untrue cos no one would think this of an introvert. I think it could happen and I do believe an introvert could be powerful and the best person for this job. But maybe if she started it saying this was a story about her. Or if she just kept calling the person Laura and never told me it was her. Whatever the case, that reveal at the end of the intro sort of colored the rest of my reading. Well that, and the extrovert hate.<br /><br />I think she does a good job pointing out the strengths introverts have, even when the assumption is these features are weaknesses. It talks about how to get the most out of introverted employees, how to best teach introverted students, what you're missing by only working with extroverts, and how even some people you may think are extroverts are actually introverts that have learned to fake it. There are a lot of interesting points, she quotes a lot of studies, and she brings up points that I hadn't considered before. Like the idea that not all introverts are shy (though many are) or that all extroverts are outgoing (though again, many are). She looks at how the emphasis on extroversion is a Western culture thing and with most Eastern cultures the opposite is true, and those that are quiet are more highly thought of.<br /><br />The focus is on introverts in the US, a society she notes is the most extroverted. Or at least places the most value on extroverts. There are a few mentions of extroversion in Europe and a little bit about introversion in China, although it's told through stories of people that now live in the US.<br /><br />I think there are a lot of good points about how important it is to not see introversion as a problem to be corrected but just a personality type and how introverts are needed. This is really an introvert's manifesto. And because of this, extroverts are sort of given the short stick. I didn't assume there would be a lot about extroverts, because why should there be. I didn't expect there to be so much focus on how extroverts are shallow, materialistic, and stupid. OK, she didn't come out and call extroverts stupid (though materialistic and shallow do come up multiple times). She just talks about how introverts are \"deep thinkers\" and how they really pay attention and prepare for things. She doesn't say extroverts don't do this, but the implication is there. I get this is coming from point where we assume extroverts are the awesomestg so there is no need to point out the good things extroverts bring to the table. Therefore she can just focus on the negative aspects. Except this comes off at times as a bit extrovert bashing. I don't think this needs to be a love note to extroverts as it is to introverts, but I think a little more about the positive things both types of people bring to the table would have been nice.<br /><br />Oh there was also another bit that irked me. This wasn't Cain, but a study she discussed where a scientist Kagan was testing how babies reacted to different stimuli and how highly reactive infants tended to be more sensitive and introverted, while those that didn't react tended to be more outgoing as adults. This part is fine. The next part, about how Kagan said that his findings even allowed him to identify physical features of introverts vs extroverts and then says introverts were more likely to have blue eyes. Which, I guess, if the only people you're including in your study are white people. Though at least Cain says these physical attribute findings are speculative, but she doesn't point out that they cut out non-white people.<br /><br />I'm not sure where I stand on the introvert/extrovert scale. Whenever I take those Myers-Briggs personality tests I get a different answer. Probably because I only ever take them online to see which <a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/harry-potter-personalities-large.jpg\">Harry Potter character I'm most like</a> (I apparently fall somewhere between Neville and Ginny, with some Snape thrown in) so I realize this isn't the most scientifically accurate way to see what my personality is, but there you go. I guess I'm somewhere in the middle. I honestly don't mind public speaking all that much, but I'm not great if I got to parties or something where I don't know a lot of people. I stay quite and will talk to one or two people. Given the choice I tend to prefer being with people (I know) than being on my own, but I also hate confrontation. I make Boyfriend+ do most of the talking when we go to look at wedding vendors.<br /><br />Overall I thought this book was interested, but I would have preferred if it talked a little bit less about all of the awful things extroverts are and all the amazing features introverts have. Maybe something a bit more balanced. But overall it's an interesting read and I do hope this helps people realize the power of introverts.<br /><br />Oh also, you should check out this video from PBS Idea Channel about introverts. And then you should check out all of the other PBS Idea Channel videos because they're pretty great.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/KtGscT3l-bs\"></iframe> <br />There are so many words Blogger doesn't recognize as real. Awesomest, however, is acceptable.<br />I should point out here that in <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2013/02/devouring-books-quiet-power-of.html\">Laura's review</a> (which is great and you should check out) she got the feeling more that Cain was saying extroverts and introverts are both great and work well together. So I could have just be overly sensitive to this. For reasons I don't really know, since I can't say I think of myself as that extroverted, but there you go. Also I think she may have called me racist for thinking this. THANKS A LOT, LAURA.<br /><br />Title quote from page 2<br /><br />Cain, Susan.

Now seems to be a good time.<br /><br />See, I'm not really sure what I'd like to do regarding my last name.<br /><br />Should I keep it? I am lazy, and this route means I don't have to change anything. I've had people tell me it's really not that hard to change your name on things, but you know what? I don't believe any of you. I'm sure these places make it as easy as possible, except I STILL have to go to the DMV. And the passport office. How much time do YOU like spending at these places? It would also mean time off work because their hours always seemed to be from 11 to 3, minus an hour for lunch break. Plus I have the added bonus of the fact that I have a bunch of stuff due to expire riiiight when we're getting married. Such as said passport. Which means I before the wedding I need to get a new one so I have it for the honeymoon, and THEN I'll need to get another one with the new name. That's lame. Plus, beyond the laziness stuff, I like my last name.<br /><br />Should I change it? On the other hand, I do like the idea of changing it. At least a little. But then what do I change it to?<br /><br />Do I go hyphenated? I could do this. Neither of our last names are particularly long so I wouldn't have a super unwieldy name. But I'm not crazy about hyphenated names. This is mostly coming from having to set up usernames for people in our systems at work and the hypenation always gives us trouble.g And while the name wouldn't be too long, it would still be sort of pain to sign on things. But these are stupid reasons to write this off as an option, which is why I haven't yet. I have a bunch of friends that have gone this route. Besides, as I said above, I like my last name. But I like his name too.<br /><br />Do I just change the name? This is certainly the expected path. And this is the one that would be the most amusing. See, I'm a little red-headed white girl. Boyfriend+ is part Chinese and his last name is Chen. Which means I would be Alley Chen, which means I could <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKpShq2X6s\">Donna Chang</a> people. And confusing strangers seems like an equally good use of a name change as the whole \"so we have the same last name\" thing. I should also point out I have a bunch of friends that just changed their name as well.<br /><br />I would throw out the options that he could change his name, or we could both hyphenate, but those have already been vetoed. I blame society. (I actually have a friend, or really a sibling of a friend, where both she and her husband hyphenated their names and I want to give them both big high fives for that.)<br /><br />So I haven't come to any decisions yet. I'll probably make them when we're actually getting the marriage license. Or maybe after that, because I'm pretty great at procrastination. And I should point out here that, outside of changing his own name, Boyfriend+ said he's cool with whatever I'd decide. He said he'd like me to change my name to his, but ultimately it's up to me what I want to do and he's not going to be mad or disappointed if I don't change my name.<br /><br />I also have a couple links I found regarding name changes, that I feel I should share cos they're pretty great.<br /><br />The first one is from Jezebel's Lindy West who wrote \"<a href=\"http://jezebel.com/men-who-insist-you-change-your-name-make-terrible-husba-1446543344\">Men Who Insist You Change Your Name Make Terrible Husbands</a>\" and she pretty much nails every thought I've had on the subject cos West is pretty great. I don't like the whole idea and basis behind a woman taking a man's name BUT I do sort of like the idea of taking his name (beyond just the Donna Chang thing).<br /><br />The second one is from the Vagenda titled \"<a href=\"http://vagendamag.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-penis-perspective-wife-by-any-other.html\">The Penis Perspective: A Wife By Any Other Name...</a>\" which is a guy's point of view on the whole name changing thing. Now it's a guy's point of view on a feminist website, so this isn't going to be the average \"I want her to take my last name FOR REASONS\" as I'm sure you'd get if this were to show up on a typical site. Or you know, in those Men's Health responses West quoted in her piece. I should say for the most part people have been asking me if I'd take his name, rather than assuming I would. So that's nice. Though the part that most hit me here was about the kids' name. The fact that many women would want to change their name so they would have the same name as any future kids, because OF COURSE the kids would take the father's last name. No question there. Which got me angry because I didn't even think of it until it was pointed out. Then I was mad that I hadn't thought of it. Or that I also assumed kids would just take the dad's name and while I'm not saying they couldn't, I'm angry that's the ingrained assumption.<br /><br />Also, the part about how invitations were being addressed to Mr. and Mrs. His Full Name. No. That shit will not fly. I already got into a (sort of) fight with my mom about this with our wedding invitations. I told her I wouldn't be addressing invitations this way, and each person is getting their own name spelled out. This is mostly an issue with her friends that are invited, and she said they wouldn't care and would expect it to be written Mr. and Mrs. His Name. I said I knew the women better, and also they are their own people, and they're my invitations so this is how it's going. They may not care, but I do.<br /><br />What do you think? For those of you who are married why did you or didn't you change your name? Did you get a lot of shit for your decision?<br /><br />Those and apostrophes in names. You O'Rourkes and O'Tooles are really messing things up. And by that I mean, we didn't program the system to do know what do with an apostrophe in a name. So I guess our fault, but I'm still going to blame you a little.<br /><br />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:45+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:45+00:00","published_at":"2013-10-27T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df15dde22fdcf000492","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"},{"value":"name change","slug":"name-change","url":"/articles/tags/name-change"}]}]},{"id":"53224df15dde2223b600009a","title":"Beauty or excellence...could redeem almost any humiliation","slug":"beauty-or-excellence-dot-dot-dot-could-redeem-almost-any-humiliation","url":"/articles/beauty-or-excellence-dot-dot-dot-could-redeem-almost-any-humiliation","body":"Happy Franzy Friday everyone!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/corrections-readalong.gif\" /><br />We finally get to meet Denise, not just through her brothers' stories. And guess what, I don't hate her! I mean, she makes not the best choices, but I'm so happy that she is more like a Gary than a Chip. My standards have obviously been lowered.<br /><br />I don't quite know why we needed the whole Robin bit in the beginning. Why is it important we learn so much about her and her family and where her money comes from? I get that we eventually get the connection to Denise because of the whole funding-her-restaurant-and-then-she-sleeps-with-both-Robin-and-Brian thing. But I don't see why that means we needed their whole back story. We don't even learn that much about Caroline, and she's actually a Lambert (through marriage, but still).<br /><br />OK, so Denise. Why do we need to start with her as a teen? We just get Chip and Gary in the present but for Denise we first have to go through the Robin's-brother-is-an-asshole story. Then we see her as a teen and her first sexual encounter(s) before we can see her in the present and why? Is it because these are the things that defined her later, where for Gary and Chip it was more them as small children? And why are these the things that defined her later? Ugh Franzen, what are you trying to say?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/goaway.gif\" /><br />And then Franzen, you really need to add sexual assault to her first time? Really? Things were creepy enough, what with Denise sleeping with one of her dad's co-workers (employees?) who's at least twice her age. Perhaps it's to make a connection to her mom and the rape scene we read last section? I don't really know what Franzen's saying here, but that's also because I'm not 100% sure he realizes he wrote two sexual assault scenes. Both options make me sad.<br /><br />So we learn that Brian made lots and lots of money and they never have to work again, so he decides he's going to open his own restaurant and he hires Denise to be the chef. She gets to run the kitchen and make the decisions about the food and get paid way too much. And she gets to go to Europe for awhile to eat and be inspired. Look how good things are going for Denise? So obviously we know this won't last. At least I like that she's a cook. I know we already knew this from the earlier Chip &amp; Gary chapters, but still. I'm just happy she's actually a cook and apparently a very good one. So see, Denise makes good decisions in one part of her life. Not so much with the trying to sleep with Brian stuff though. Of course, she seemed almost like she didn't want to do it. That she was going to have to. Not that Brian was forcing her but that that was what was expected based on the way he was acting and that's just how things work.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/weepanddie.gif\" /><br />Let's talk about something happier. Brian and Robin's kids are annoying and pretentious. This is happier for me, because making fun of small, fictional children is fun. But seriously, \"you be a pathogen...and I'll be a leukocyte\" and no. No. Shut up.<br /><br />I like that Denise was so focused at getting Robin to like her, not because she really wanted to be Robin's friend, but because she wanted to deny her the satisfaction of disliking her. All I could think was<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bemyfriend.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"></a>Of course then they become more than just friends, because TWIST. You think Denise will have an affair with Brian, but turns out she's going to have one with his wife! And then with him because why not. I wasn't crazy about the affair with Robin, but mostly because of how the restaurant was suffering by her not being there, because I have messed up priorities. But dammit, Denise, this is a kick ass opportunity and you're sort of throwing it away. I'm not saying STOP sleeping with Robin. I'm just saying, maybe quit sneaking away from the restaurant during the dinner rush.<br /><br />Now you've lost both Robin and Brian AAAND the restaurant. Dammit. I knew that was going to happen.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/blam.gif\" /><br />And we learn that Alfred didn't die. Which...what? How? <br />Then there's some stuff about Chip and he was in Lithuania but now the country is falling apart and he's trying to get back to the States but doesn't really want to and blah blah blah. I tried to pay attention to this section, but really didn't care. Maybe Chip will end up just stuck at the airport in Lithuania. Or he'll be shot there. Whatever.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dontcare.gif\" /><br />Sorry this was all over the place, but really, you know what you're getting into. Next week, we finish this thing! Will everyone stop being terrible? (Probably not.) Will Alfred be visited by more talking poo? (Thinking 50/50 chance.) Will Jonah find out he was actually adopted, and his real parents are loving and normal people who have come to take him back with him and give him lots of books to read? Also he's actually a wizard and he'll get to go to Hogwarts. But Hogwarts after the HP stories, so he doesn't have to deal with ever year of school getting ruined by Voldemort. I assume Jonah would appreciate really getting a full education. (Yeah, so this won't be happening, but oh man, how great would that be? You'd never see it coming. [Except if it does happen, I clearly just called it. I don't really know where I'm going with this, but it's been a long day.])<br /><br />Till next week!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/franzeeeeeh.jpg\" /><br /><br /><link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"all\" href=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/styles/default.css\" /><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/loc_en.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/opt_defaults.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/misterlinky.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/autolink.php?mode=standard&owner=whatredread&postid=25Oct2013\"></script><br/>Title quote from page 377","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:45+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:45+00:00","published_at":"2013-10-25T04:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df15dde2223b600009b","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Jonathan Franzen","slug":"jonathan-franzen","url":"/articles/tags/jonathan-franzen"},{"value":"Corrections","slug":"corrections","url":"/articles/tags/corrections"},{"value":"Corrections readalong","slug":"corrections-readalong","url":"/articles/tags/corrections-readalong"}]}]},{"id":"53224df25dde2223b600009c","title":"Top Character Names I Love and a Few Terrible Ones","slug":"top-character-names-i-love-and-a-few-terrible-ones","url":"/articles/top-character-names-i-love-and-a-few-terrible-ones","body":"I'm going to be upfront with you.

Thursday Next from the Thursday Next series - I don't like names that are ridiculous or unusual just for the sake of being unusual. Thursday's name is just unique enough to be interesting, but not so out of the blue that I think \"You poor dear. Your childhood must have sucked.\"<br /><br />2. Coraline from Coraline - As with Thursday, it's juuuust this side of unusual. I mean, it's really just Caroline with two of the letters switched but I LOVE THE NAME CORALINE. (Did I mention I read this not long ago and very much enjoyed it so I'm still in internet-shouty mode?)<br /><br />3. Rosalind from As You Like It - I just think this is a pretty name.<br /><br />4. Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird - I supposed technically this is a nickname, but still. it's so much more her than \"Jean Louise\" is.<br /><br />Top Character Names That Make My Eyes Roll So Far Back I Actually Give Myself A Headache<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/lemon-eyeroll.gif\" /><br />5. Jaime Lannister from The Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones series - The name itself isn't bad. The fact that this is a character in an epic fantasy series and his nickname his \"Kingslayer\" but his real name is Jaime, and I'm sorry. No. That makes me laugh every time. A fantasy name with lots of consonants would have made more sense. But Jaime is not a name that instills fear in my heart. Updated to fix the fact that it's  Jaime and not Jamie. Neither name is scary<br /><br />6. Bella Swan from the Twilight series - Really? Bella Swan? Not even going to try the whole \"subtly\" thing, huh?<br /><br />7. Renesmme from the Twilight series - Oh Meyer, you made it here twice. Congrats. At least she seemed to realize, at least on some level, that this name is ridiculous given she had characters make fun of it. I mean, she also later had a teenager fall in love with a new born, so I guess that was his punishment.<br /><br />8. Anastasia Rose Steel Grey from the 50 Shades of Grey series - Ladies and gentlemen, we have our champion. I think 8 year old me would have put this in the other category, because 8 year old me had terrible tastes. (Have you read J<a href=\"http://jennytrout.wordpress.com/jenny-reads-50-shades-of-grey/\">ennifer's 50 Shades recaps</a>?

It's another Franzy Friday!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/franzeeeeeh.jpg\" />Now we've made it through section 2, which was the longest section in this readalong. AND Goodreads tells me we're more than 50% of the way done. Which really just means I didn't split this up very well but what are you gonna do? Let's just enjoy the moment.<br /><br />I did a lot of this reading during the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/reeeaaaaaadathooooonnn\">Dewey's Readathon</a> which meant it was easy for me to take notes. While for some this may mean a coherent and well thought out post, please instead expect there to be more random thoughts than usual since instead of having to just remember the stuff that happened, I wrote down a whooole bunch of stuff that is probably not that important. My note taking did take a nosedive near the end of this section, but that's because I spent a lot of time going \"wait...what just happened?\" Because, seriously, whatnow? To my random thoughts!<br /><br />We get to meet Gary, the final member of the Lambert clan. I want to applaud Franzen's ability to make me hear the cacophony in his house. When Gary's trying to talk to Enid and everyone is just loud and yelling and needs something and OMG just shut up for 10 minutes, please.<br /><br />Of course, Gary didn't exactly win me any sympathy points when we first meet him. He complains about the awesome dark room his wife had built for him because he really didn't want it anymore and he'd rather do his photo stuff on computers and now it's this gift he feels he HAS to use. And I get it, that would suck and be awkward. But you know what I get more? Your wife got you a super kick ass gift, and something YOU HAD BEEN SAYING you wanted to shut up and be grateful.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/wambulance.gif\" />(Also I would like a darkroom, pleaseandthankyou.)<br /><br />Gary's wife Caroline had some sympathy points with me at first. I mean, the darkroom, she's a mom that actually wants to spend time with her kids, and she gets hurt and Gary won't help her cos she didn't hurt her back inside but hurt it running around and WHO CARES, YOUR WIFE IS HURT. STOP BEING AN ASS. But then she does shit like wants to be her kids' best friend and totally not their mom and UGH<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/coolmom.gif\" />But even that I could let slide. Then she says this:<br /><blockquote>Basically, I think your brother's got the right idea. Here's a sweet, smart, funny man who's honest enough to say what he can and can't tolerate in the way of get-togethers.</blockquote>And I'm sorry no. We're done. Chip is sweet and smart and funny and honest? AHAHAHAHA. No you lose. You lose everything.<br /><br />Gary won back all his sympathy points plus Caroline's when I realized how terrible she is. I mean, her being an idiot about Chip is one thing. But what is this absolute refusal to go to St. Jude's and spend time with Enid and Alfred for one last Christmas. Oh I'm sorry, one time you went out there and had a bad time? A kid got sick and you fell down? Yeah, those are reasons to NEVER VISIT YOUR IN-LAWS AGAIN. God, you suck.<br /><br />Man, I didn't realize how ragey this section made me.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/prstabs.gif\" /><br />I still like Denise best, Chip is an ass and needs punched, and I'm starting to pity Gary. I don't like him, but I see he's really trying to do the right thing. He's trying to get the money from his dad's patent, even though his dad doesn't want it. It doesn't seem like he wants the money for himself, so the motivations don't seem entirely selfish. He's sort of a dick to Caroline, but she's a zillion times worse and is working on turning the two oldest sons against him, so who cares. He seems like he was told that if he had this type of life, he would be happy. And he's not, so he's falling apart but he really wants to keep it together. Meanwhile, he's sort of<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/screamsinternally.gif\" /><br />Plus we see some childhood flashbacks where Alfred is terrible and mean and I'm starting to actually feel bad for Enid having to put up with him. It's difficult to connect the Alfred who has trouble sitting on Chip's weird sex couch and hallucinates a Mr. Hankey as being such a dick when he was all there. But wtf him smashing all of the jars because Enid hadn't gotten around to moving them. Chip's reactions to him are starting to make sense.<br /><br />Speaking of those flashbacks, we see how Enid ended up with Alfred. Well, kind of. But we see Enid was trying to make a good choice and find a good husband, and that sort of backfired, didn't it? She was hoping his personality would change and nope. I guess at least she did get someone that's a good earner, since that's what she wanted.<br /><br />The cruise part. Pretty much all of that. I have no idea what's going on. So like I mentioned above, Alfred hallucinates some talking poop, but also Enid meets a lady whose daughter was raped and murdered and whose husband has decided the way to deal with things is to pretend it didn't happen, and then some crazy ship doctor guy gives Enid a bunch of \"Aslan\" pills, and Alfred possibly falls off the side of the boat.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/waitwhut.gif\" />Can someone explain this whole section to me because I'm not even sure if anything I just typed above happened. It's all a weird blur, which I think is the feeling you're supposed to get when reading this section (and if so, again, kudos Mr. Franzy) but I don't really know what we're going to get when we start the next section. Which I suppose is a good thing. It'll keep us reading.<br /><br />Next week we'll read up to the section One Last Christmas. Hopefully we'll learn more about Denise and we'll figure out if Alfred actually did fall of the boat and maybe that Chip was really beat up by that Lithuanian guy<br /><link href=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/styles/default.css\" media=\"all\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"></link><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/loc_en.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/opt_defaults.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/misterlinky.js\"></script><script src=\"http://www.blenza.com/linkies/autolink.php?mode=standard&amp;owner=whatredread&amp;postid=17Oct2013\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script> Title quote from page 171<br /><br />Franzen, Jonathan.

And also about how sitting around and reading all day is not really how I'd choose to spend my time. Which I feel is a sort of blasphemy for a bookish person.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jim-head-shake.gif\" /><br />I get the feeling the point of the readathon is to give ourselves the excuse to spend the whole day reading. The idea is almost that this is what we'd like to do anyway, but real life gets in the way. So this day is more to tell other people to leave us readers be more than it is a challenge for us to spend the day just reading. You know, for most participants anyway.<br /><br />I was talking to a friend last Friday and I told her my weekend plans included doing a readathon. She paused and said \"Huh. I don't think I could do that. I'd get too restless.\" My first instinct was to defend it. But then I thought about it and honestly, I don't do that much reading just sitting around at home, not unless I have something to compel me to read: a story I'm especially sucked into (this doesn't happen all that often, even when I do enjoy a book), I have to read to meet a deadline (like for a readalong), a readathon. Otherwise if I'm just hanging out at home I'm messing around online or playing Plants vs Zombies 2, or watching TV. Or honestly, a mix of those 3 things. On the one hand, reading requires too much focus, so I can't do it while doing other things. On the other hand, reading is always immersive enough. I can start reading, but I can also get easily distracted by pretty much everything around me.<br /><br />But it can't just be things around me are distracting. I do the majority of my reading on the LIRR and subway, which are not exactly bastions of peacefulness. But the distractions on public transportation are the sort I'm actively trying to ignore (the weird smell of the guy next to me, the fact that this lady and I are currently sharing 2sq feet of personal space, the crazy man screaming that he's not short even though no one told him he's short and he is really of average height) while the things at home are vying for my attention in a positive way (I need to kill more zombies so I can get more keys and get better plants to kill more zombies). OK, maybe not positive. But just \"things I'd like to ignore\" and \"things I like to pay attention to, even if maybe I should do less of it\". <br /><br />In this case a readathon, be it the Dewey 24 hour one or <a href=\"http://readingthebricks.blogspot.com/2013/07/its-mini-readathon-time-again.html\">Tika's mini-readathon</a>, gives me the push to do something I enjoy doing but don't usually do if I'm just hanging around the house. Even then I have to remind myself, \"No! Do not go online. Stop that. Sit down and read.\" I'm not hating my time reading. But I do have to work to stay focused on reading instead of doing anything else.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/trieddontcriticize.gif\" />Am I alone in this? OK, I don't actually believe I'm alone in this, but I guess how many other people have to make themselves read, even when it's something they want to be doing, and that they enjoy doing?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:46+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:46+00:00","published_at":"2013-10-17T13:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df25dde22fdcf000494","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"},{"value":"Readathon","slug":"readathon","url":"/articles/tags/readathon"}]}]},{"id":"53224df35dde223867000230","title":"Readathon Update Another!","slug":"readathon-update-another","url":"/articles/readathon-update-another","body":"The reading is continuing!<br /><br />Let's give an update shall we?<br /><br />Books read<br />~100 pages of Corrections<br />~20% of Alif the Unseen<br />~3 and 1/2 discs from World War Z<br /><br />So yeah, I have no idea how much I've actually read.

I don't plan on reading most of what's here. This is just the TBR pile I have sitting near me and that seems like a good place to start. Top to bottom<br /><br />World War Z by Max Brooks - This is the audiobook I mentioned before. I figured I needed something Halloween-y and also it's fantastic. I don't care if I've read the book twice before and listened to the audiobook earlier this year.<br />The Corrections by Franzey - You all know I'm doing <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/you-could-feel-it-something-terrible\">that readalong</a> right? You should joooin in.<br />Alif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson - OK, so this is actually my Kindle, but it has Alif on it. It has a lot of stuff on it so there's a good chance I'll pick up Attachments where I last left off for this readathon too.<br />Quiet by Susan Cain - I bought this about a month ago and keep saying I should read it. So hopefully I'll actually start it now<br />The Hours by Michael Cunningham - I believe I bought this right around the time of Quiet. Hooray sales racks.<br />Shakespeare's Insults by W.F. Hill and C.J. Ottchen - Who doesn't like some good Shakespearian insults?<br />The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat by Oliver Sacks - Yes, let's laugh at people seeking psychological help<br /><br />At this point we get to my TBR books that I want to read, but they've been on the pile for over a year. Actually, I think I won a couple of them during a readathon I did 2 years ago...<br /><br />The Ladies of Grace Adieu by Susanna Clarke - I loved Strange &amp; Norrell so I thought I should try this. I haven't yet...<br />With My Body by Nikki Gemmell - Not really sure what this one is about. Won it in a set of 5 mystery books.<br />When We Argued All Night by Aliuce Mattison - Another won book<br />The Given Day by Dennis Lehane - This one I do want to read cos I heart me some Lehane, it's just so big. My shoulders weep if they see me putting it near my purse.<br /><br />Oh and question time!<br /><br />1. What fine part of the world are you reading from today? <br />I'm in NY for now and will be hopping over to NJ later. Then back in NY.<br /><br />2. Which book in your stack are you most looking forward to? <br />I actually really want to get through this week's Franzen section. And Quiet has been on my radar for awhile now. And there's a chance I may go to a bookstore later and try to find a copy of Coraline...<br /><br />3. Which snacks are you most looking forward to? <br />Hmm haven't really planned those. I have these coconut bar things that are pretty great. It's pretty much a mounds bar without the chocolate. And some carrots if I need to be healthy<br /><br />4. Tell us a little something about yourself.<br />I am terrible at planning and assume things will just get figured out on their own. Hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />5. If you participated in the last readathon, what will you do differently? Or if this is your first, what are you most looking forward to?<br />I participated a few years ago and I think that was a last minute decision too. But it was fun. I think I'll try to do things mostly the same, except this time around I'll have to be in a few locations, so we'll see how things go.<br /><br />I haven't decided how I'll update (keep it all in one post? separate posts?) So we'll see. For now I'm going to start with some Franzen and maybe ride the bike while reading.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:48+00:00","published_at":"2013-10-12T13:01:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df45dde22641900056a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Readathon","slug":"readathon","url":"/articles/tags/readathon"}]}]},{"id":"53224df45dde22fdcf000497","title":"You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen","slug":"you-could-feel-it-something-terrible-was-going-to-happen","url":"/articles/you-could-feel-it-something-terrible-was-going-to-happen","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/corrections-readalong.gif\" />Welcome to Friday and our first Corrections post. Well first one where we actually talk about the book. And you know what? I actually enjoyed it.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/prdoubletake.gif\" />I know, right? What? I thought it was going to be very dense and difficult to get through. The beginning, before we get to Chip's story, was a little bit difficult to start. I didn't just fall into the rhythm. I had to learn it. But once I did, the reading went really fast.<br /><br />Before we get into the post I have something to share. There was some talk of how Franzey is sort of like Fonzie and hey, wouldn't it be great if that was a thing? I mentioned it to Boyfriend+, and look what he has given us:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/franzen-fonz.jpg\" />We have our mascot. Now, TO THE POST<br /><br />gBeware, for thar be spoilers. Also this isn't going to be anything coherent but instead a bunch of random thoughts I had while reading. I figured that structure worked out during the HP readalong.<br /><br />Even though I said I'm actually enjoying the book doesn't mean I LIKE the characters. I mean at this point I don't think enough people are punching Chip. This should be a every-time-he-shows-up type of thing. He's just so terrible and pathetic and pretentious and yes, I do think we're seeing some Franzen in there. But I think it's safe to say there is no issue with Mary Sue-ing here.<br /><br />Since so much of this first chapter focused on Chip, let's see what notes I took:<br /><br />Chip wore leather pants to go pick his parents up from the airport. CHIP WORE LEATHER PANTS.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/umsureok.gif\" />Chip is watching Cent Ans de Cinema Erotique. Dammit, even your porn is pretentious. You are terrible. And you're going to be pissed after throwing your pretentio-porn in the dishwasher, because you are totally going to want that VHS back. I feel like he'd still be watching VHS porn even in the internet age. You know, because Chip is Franzen and they both hate technology.<br /><br />Of course, Chip had weird sex with an undergrad. Because he's creepy. But then the whole humping the chaise searching for remnants of vaginal tang? That's moving into new and special levels of creepiness<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/eww.gif\" />Chip gets so angry at his sister for wearing a tank top in a photo in the magazine. At first I was on his side. \"Yeah, why are they doing this girl-as-object thing??\" But then I thought about it some more and thought \"She's just wearing a fucking tank top? What's the answer? There can't be any photos of women? Or they have to be totally covered up? I hate you Chip.\" I don't know how much of that is actual anger or how much of it is because Chip sucks so much.<br /><br />So did Chip end up in Lithuania? I sort of lost the plot at this point.<br /><br />Now some non-Chip stuff. I am undecided on if I like Enid or not. I think she's a bit racist, from a different time, very concerned with appearances and what the neighbors think and a bit manipulative. Maybe it's more than a bit. I'm hoping to see some more of her. I sort of picture her as a light-weight, Midwestern version of Lucille Bluth. She doesn't seem as conniving as Lucille but I don't think she's as naive as she'd like people to think. Her repeatedly telling Denise the story about Norma? Yeah, she's not as sharp as Lucille, but she knows what she's doing.<br /><br />We've seen Alfred and Denise, but I feel like we've really only been introduced to Chip and to a slightly lesser extent Enid. I feel like I have opinions about those characters. Al and Denise we have a sketch of them, but we haven't filled in the shading just yet. Then there's Gary who we haven't even met yet.<br /><br />I hope we get more Denise and Enid in the next section. And Al. I guess.  Oh, and since this opening wasn't nearly as painful as I assumed, I'm thinking we'll be fine to read some extra pages. So read until you get to The Generator chapter break.

Then there's <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/she-looked-liked-art-and-art-wasnt\">Eleanor &amp; Park</a> which is wonderful and makes me wish I had enough money to buy everyone in the <a href=\"http://bookriot.com/2013/09/19/dont-ban-books-like-eleanor-park-teens-need/\">Minnesota Anoka-Hennepin district a copy of this book</a>. Fangirl did not disappoint. You know, if the fact that I almost missed my stop wasn't obvious enough. I really can't decide which one I like best. Every time I make a decision, I change my mind and remember the other 2 exist. So just know they're all wonderful and you should probably read them all right away if you haven't already. Even if you have, maybe read them again.<br /><br />Cath is, I believe, a classic introvert.g She and her identical twin sister Wren are starting college in the fall and to Cath's disappointment, Wren doesn't want to room with her. She thinks it's about time they meet other people. She doesn't want to go exploring, not even to find the cafeteria, which means she spends a lot of time eating granola bars in her room. She doesn't want to meet new people, not even her roommate Reagan, who can be a bit intimidating but is also sharing a tiny space with you so maybe say hi. Cath is out of her comfort zone all the time. Except when she's writing fanfic about Simon Snow, which is Harry Potter (except HP is also a thing in this world). I don't know what else to say about the plot without giving things away but there's so much good stuff with Levi, Reagan's friend that is always hanging out in their room and seems unnaturally nice, and Cath's writing classmate Nick, and Cath's dad, and Wren with her more \"traditional\" I guess collect experience. I'm trying really hard not to start rambling and how much I like this, and it's not going all that well.<br /><br />Rowell makes me happy because first she makes Eleanor a redhead BUT she's not Irish, and she has brown eyes which is so nice to see (because seriously, not every redhead has green eyes). THEN this time she writes this:<br /><br />\"I can't decide what color [Cath's eyes] are. What does it say on your driver's license?\"<br />\"Blue.\"<br />\"They're not blue.\"<br />\"They are on the outside.\"<br />\"And brown in the middle,\" [Levi] said. \"And gray on the edge and green in between.\"<br /><br />And TOTALLY nails what my brother's eyes look like. Maybe I have a doppelganger family living somewhere in Nebraska.<br /><br />What's that? You'd like some more example quotes. Well, if you insist.<br /><br />In new situations, all the trickiest rules are the ones nobody bothers to explain to you. (And the ones you can't google.) Like, where does the line start? What food can you take? Where are you supposed to stand, then where are you supposed to sit? Where do you go when you're done, why is everyone watching you?...Bah.<br />(I go through this pretty much anytime I'm in a new situation and it's why I end up getting lunch at the same few places. New things are stressful.)<br /><br />\"I feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend.\"<br />\"I don't want to be your friend,\" Cath said as sternly as she could. \"I like that we're not friends.\"<br />\"Me, too,\" Reagan said. \"I'm sorry you ruined it by being so pathetic.\"<br /><br />\"It makes me feel like the Ugly One.\"<br />\"You're not the ugly one.\" Levi grinned. \"You're just the Clark Kent.\"<br /><br />\"I don't like hello. It makes me sound like I have dementia, like I've never heard a phone ring before and I don't know what's supposed to happen next. Hello?\"<br /><br />I'll stop now, but know I could keep going.<br /><br />I really liked this book. I liked Levi, I loved Reagan (and would like to add her to the list of fictional people I would like to be BFFs with), I like Cath's dad, I even grew to like Cath and it didn't even take that long. Which is good goes she's the main character so you spend a lot of time with her. I can't say the Simon Snow and Carry On chapters were my favorite thing, but I liked them more than I expected to. Not as much as I like the \"real world\" chapters, but still.<br /><br />If this was a different author and you told me to read a sort of YA, sort of love story that centers around a very shy girl who writes fan fiction, I would smile and nod at you while thinking that I will never be getting around to this. But as soon as you say Rainbow Rowell wrote it, well I am there. And I love it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to continue reading all of those lines I highlighted.<br /><br />I haven't read Quiet yet but it's on my radar. And I assume once I get to it I'll be an expert.<br />I really have no idea what is and isn't YA. This is why I never organize my books by genre. Or at all.<br /><br />Title quote from page 299, location 4721<br /><br />Rowell, Rainbow. Fangirl. St. Martin's Griffin, 2013.

And I don't mean \"I wish I'd read it sooner because I think I missed my window, like with A Wrinkle in Time.\" I mean it like \"Dammit, high school me would have really liked this book, as does present day me, and had I read it back in high school I'd have more time to read and enjoy it.\" Which I know is a little When Harry Met Sally-esque, but still. True.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/GoodOmens+cover.jpg\" />Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch is the story of the Apocalypse, which is due to happen next Saturday. In preparation Satan sent his son up to earth to be born, but there was a bit of a mix up in the Satanist Nun run hospital and little Adam was raised as a normal human. Of course he still has a very confused hellhound. Best friends Aziraphale and Crowley, and angel and demon respectively, have grown to enjoy (or are at least amused by) Earth and the people on it and aren't so keen for everything to end. The Four Horsemen, War, Famine, Pollution (Pestilence retired once penicillin was invented), and Death are gathering. Then there's Anathema Device, descendant of the titular prophet and witch Agnes Nutter, who has the only copy of Agnes's totally accurate prophesies and knows the end is coming. She joins forces with Newton Pulsifer, descendant of the man that orchestrated Agnes's burning at the stake, to try to find the Antichrist.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/if-you-can-fake-sincerity-youve-got-it\">My first Gaiman experience</a> didn't go so well but I heard there was a connection between this book and the movie Dogma which I was (am) a big big fan of. Hence the reason why high school me probably would have loved this book. After this I'm thinking Gaiman needs to team up with Prachett all the time, pleaseandthankyou. This was great. It was hilarious and surprisingly easy to keep track of all of the characters and story lines that all come together to try to stop the impending Apocalypse.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is that the book went by too quickly. I couldn't help by blow through it. I wanted to know what happened next. I wanted to see if Adam ever realized the powers he had. I wanted to see if Asiraphale and Crowley would be able to find Adam and stop the Final Judgement. The Four Horsemen are dealt with so cleverly. Pollution is a little heavy handed and I could see him as a Captain Planet villain, but Famine is so great (he owns restaurants that serve insanely small portions and creates diet food so even people in developed nations are literally starving to death) that it all evens out.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what to say. Anytime I write a review of a book I enjoy I never really know what to say to really convince you that you should read this. Guess it's a good thing I don't write book reviews or anything. So yeah, if you liked Dogma you should read this cos you'll probably enjoy it too. It's not the same and it's not a movie version or interpretation of the book, but you can tell the book influenced the movie (and I believe Smith even thanked Gaiman in the credits. Which seems mean to leave Pratchett out...) If you haven't seen Dogma, you should do that. Then you should go ahead and read this. Or read this first and then see the movie. Either order is fine, really. As long as you've got both covered.<br /><br />Title quote from page 22<br /><br />Gaiman, Neil and Terry Pratchett.

Except we sort of already all know each other so that's probably a waste of time. Instead, let's talk about Franzen and why we're doing this. Or hesitations we may have about the book. It's almost like an AA meeting.<br /><br />I'm reading The Corrections because I bought it almost 3 full years ago (October 10, 2010) on my way back home from a friend's wedding. I had finished whatever book I brought with me and was browsing one of the airport bookshops. I didn't know much about Franzen. This was still early in my book blogging days. I just knew I'd seen the cover, and the summary looked like something I'd be into. Then for whatever reason, I ended up not starting the book during my flight home. Probably cos of the massive hangover I was also nursing. I got about 5 pages in before I quit. I tried again last year for the Smooth Criminals reading challenge and yeah, that worked out just as well. I'm hoping the readalong is the thing.<br /><br />I'm hosting it because Laura said it's my turn.<br /><br />As for my hesitations. Well...<br /><br />Is it possible to enjoy a novel if the author is a doucheface? <br /><br />Short answer: Yes<br />Long answer: Well, most of the time...<br /><br />The way I see it there are 2 general types of douchefaces: <br />Douchefaces who just seem like they'd be unpleasant to hang out with but aren't necessarily terrible people<br />Douchefaces who are racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic various other -ists and -phobics and overall seem like just awful people<br /><br />This can be further broken down into 2 groups:<br />Douchefaces who are alive<br />Douchefaces who are dead<br /><br />And because seeing Tina Fey host SNL made me realize how much I miss Liz Lemon, I'll let her demonstrate my emotions towards these different doucheface authors<br /><br />Unpleasant &amp; Dead<br />Let's say we have a doucheface who isn't awful, merely unpleasant, and they're dead. Well, that's pretty easy. There are lots of people I don't really want to hang out with. I'm pretty sure that's the majority of the world, so you'd be very busy if you constantly let it get to you. And they're dead so you won't have to listen to them being obnoxious in any new interviews. Think of this as Charles Dickens. He (as I learned from Alice) was very openly an ass to his wife. But he's not getting into any new family abandonment shenanigans what with being dead and all, and you can read his stuff with a clear conscious.<br /><br />Liz Lemon Level:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LLrude.gif\" /><br />Unpleasant &amp; Alive<br />Next, what if we have the merely-unpleasant doucheface and s/he's also still hanging around? Other than causing spontaneous eye-rolls whenever you read their latest complaint about whatever is pissing them off at the moment or maybe they're the Lindsay Lohan/Charlie Sheen of the literary world and you just watch them make new and exciting bad decisions while you continue to enjoy their early work. Maybe you don't want to encourage their behavior and buying their new books/keeping them relevant is, in a long distance kind of way, encouraging this. But whatever. This is where Franzyg falls. He may <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2013/09/16/rage-jonathan-franzen/\">bitch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/jonathan-franzen-wrong-modern-world\">moan</a> about how <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/jonathan-franzen-still-doesnt-like-the-internet.html\">terrible Twitter</a> is or how he <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114762/jennifer-weiner-responds-jonathan-franzen\">can't stand</a> TV and <a href=\"http://bookriot.com/2013/09/18/live-blogging-franzen-guardian-essay/\">doesn't even OWN</a> one but that doesn't really affect his writing. We're still in no harm/no foul territory. <br /><br />Liz Lemon Level:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LL_eyeroll.gif\" /><br />Awful &amp; Dead<br />Now we get into more complicated territory. What if the doucheface author in question was an awful person? But the key word there is WAS cos now they're dead. Perhaps they were horrible racists. And vocal ones at that. Maybe they were some of the original \"make me a sandwich\" sexists, or whatever some historical equivalent of that would be. But the bad (wo)man is gone now and can't hurt you any more. Think of this as Flannery O'Connor. She apparently loved her some racist jokes and had no problem pissing off her Civil Rights Activists friends with them. It may be uncomfortable cos you want to love the authors as much as you love their work. But you know what, it's fine. You can hate what the person stood for, but they aren't around to keep being terrible so you don't have to worry about supporting their hatred.<br /><br />Liz Lemon Level:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LLlastnerve.gif\" /><br />Awful &amp; Alive<br />Finally we have the worst of them. The awful doucheface who is still alive and keeps being awful. They let you know how much they hate X type of person. And they support foundations that make the world a terrible place. This is noted homophobe Orson Scott Card. Is it possible to separate the author completely from their work? Yeah. Will I yell at people if I see them reading his stuff? Nope. Am I happy that I read Ender's Game before knowing about all his doucheface-ness? So happy. Will I be reading any more of his stuff or seeing the Ender's Game movie? Probably not till he's dead. Or if he does a 180. <a href=\"http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/07/09/tolerance-for-intolerance-boycotting-enders-game/\">Chuck Wendig puts it much better than I ever could</a>, but look, I don't want to support this guy. I don't want to support him financially so he can (again, in a very long distance sort of way) spend that money I gave him on groups I hate.<br /><br />Liz Lemon Level:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LL_dealbreaker.gif\" /><br />SO.

(I've since acquired As You Like It and Hamlet as well)<br /><br />2 copies of The Great Gatsby<br />Or 3 if you consider we also have a poster made up of the text of the book.

I started it by apologizing for not posting more last week and blamed Franzen for itg. And then I realized I should probably give some thought into a readalong schedule cos I hadn't done that yet. Then I was exhausted after putting that together and decided instead of finishing up (or really starting) this review my time would be better spent with a West Wing marathon. Which I now realize sort of gives the impression that I didn't enjoy Horns and the opposite is true. I'm just very easily distracted.<br /><br />I won a copy of <a href=\"http://kfmurphy.blogspot.com/2013/08/book-review-horns-by-joe-hill-and-very.html\">Horns from Kayleigh</a> which is awesome and thank you for that! I really didn't know anything about it before her review (which you should check out) except that Harry Potter was going to be in this weird movie where he plays a guy that has horns. It's also written by Stephen King's son, but I guess he doesn't want you to know that cos he changed his name. Of course if it was really a sekrit he wouldn't have done that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/magazine/stephen-kings-family-business.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">NYT article</a>. I don't know if I would have figured it out had I not known they were related before I started reading it, but I kept getting the feeling that if you told me this was a Stephen King book, I wouldn't have even questioned you.<br /><br />So, right, the plot. Ignatius Perrish wakes up one morning with a particularly heinous hangover and, oh yeah, he's grown horns. Things had already been pretty shitty for Ig. His long-time girlfriend Merrin had been found raped and murdered a year earlier and even though charges were never brought up against him everyone in town assumes Ig did it, and he got away with it because of his families money and connections.<br /><br />Ig's still trying to get a handle on the whole horns thing when he wanders out to the living room and he sees his roommate/fuck buddy Glenna sitting on the couch. She doesn't seem to notice the horns. She does start telling him weird things. Not just telling him things, like how she gave a friend of theirs a blog job the other day, but asking permission from Ig to do things she knows she shouldn't. It seems these horns make people want to confess their deepest desires and are just looking for an excuse to act on these impulses. Ig's become a devil-on-the-shoulder for everyone he goes near, even though Ig isn't a particularly devilish character. But he's been given an opportunity to perhaps find out the truth and perhaps move on. And now the book becomes a whodunnit/revenge thriller.<br /><br />I really loved Ig's character. He's not what I expected, which is good, because the character I was expecting would have been boring. Ig is tortured by Merrin's death and by the fact that everyone has turned on him. He's so hurt and he has no one. And he has no idea what happened to Merrin. He only knows that he's innocent, despite what everyone may believe.<br /><br />The book is a lot of things. Like I said above, it's a whodunnit and a revenge story and a thriller. It also provides some interesting insights to \"the devil inside\" and there's some dark humor there. Oh and supernatural, you know, what with the horns and all. But it does a good job keeping everything from getting too muddled.<br /><br />I agree with Kayleigh that I liked present day Ig and that story more than the flashbacks. I liked the flashbacks and thought they were interesting and they added some good twists and motivations to the present day story. But then went on for a long time and I kept glancing ahead to see how long before we got back to horned Ig. Maybe if those sections had been broken up more I wouldn't have minded them as much.<br /><br />Overall this was a great book. If you like King (Laaaaura) you should give Hill a try. If you're not a fan of horror maaaybe give this a pass, although I wouldn't say this is necessarily a scary book. It's a very good book. I realize I only mentioned Ig and obviously as the main character you spend the most time with him. The others are...it seems wrong to say \"fun\" to watch but I was invested in their stories. Even when at times I wanted to turn away.<br /><br />Expect to see me blaming Franzen for a lot of things over the next month. Subway delays? Dammit, Franzen.<br />She also sent me these crazy chocolate candy bars that have pop rocks and jelly beans in them. I'm pretty sure we have no equivalent of them over here and I think this just means I'm going to need to make a trip to her land to stock up.<br /><br />Title quote from page 255<br /><br />Hill, Joe.

What can I say, just the thought of hosting this Corrections readalong is exhausting.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/corrections-readalong.gif\" />I was actually in the middle of writing a review of Horns (to be posted later this week...hopefully) when I realized I should probably at least start to figure out the reading schedule for Corrections. I determined roughly how many pages we should read and then I thought I'd find a chapter break around there. Hey, guess what this book doesn't have many of. Chapters! God, Franzen, you're such an asshole.<br /><br />I now understand why my professors would beg us to all buy the same copy of the book, this way they could just say \"read through page 250\" and page 250 would be the same for everyone. But I'm going to assume we all have our own copies and just using page numbers won't work. So here's what I figured, but please, if anyone has a better idea, speak up. Because this is already a mess and we haven't even started yet.<br /><br />October 4th - Intro post! I'd say introduce yourself but I'm pretty sure we all know each other so maybe write a little something about Franzen or this book or why you're doing this<br /><br />October 11th - Luckily this first chapter break sort of works. Read up to the section titled The More He Thought About It, The Angrier He Got. Plus this title captures my feelings of trying to put this schedule together<br /><br />October 18th - Here's where things get messy. So I was trying to do roughly 140 pages between each week. Except there is NOTHING, no chapter break, no section breaks, nothing, around this point. Because Franzen is a jerk. So, two options. We can go with more like 200 pages for this section and make it to the next section called The Generator which is on page 336 (in my copy anyway, which is the trade paperback from Picador).<br /><br />If we think that will be too much Franzen for 1 week, at around page 300 there's a big text block that starts with \"Some mysteries of her obsession, Sylvia said, were that she'd been raised as a Quaker...\" so we could stop there. I have no idea if that is in the middle of some big important action sequence so if it is, sorry about that. And again, please speak up if anyone has any better ideas.<br /><br />October 25th - Let's read up to the section called One Last Christmas. That looks like it will work with either Oct 18th section break we go with.<br /><br />Nov 1st - FINISH HIM! So I realize we're no longer in October but it's ONE DAY later and I thought it better to finish in November than try to cram in the Franzen to just 3 weeks. This can also be our wrap up post for any final thoughts and perhaps plans about how we'll pretentiously work in some Franzen quotes at our next party.<br /><br />Let's see how many times this readalong makes me feel like this<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/wantanap.gif\" /><br />I'm guessing at least 6.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:51+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:51+00:00","published_at":"2013-09-23T13:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df75dde22fdcf00049c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Corrections readalong","slug":"corrections-readalong","url":"/articles/tags/corrections-readalong"}]}]},{"id":"53224df75dde22641900056f","title":"Corrections readalong: Wanna play?","slug":"corrections-readalong-wanna-play","url":"/articles/corrections-readalong-wanna-play","body":"I have had The Corrections sitting on my shelf for years now and it seems pretty clear there's no way I'm reading this unless I have some additional incentive.

This book is a collection of humorous short stories (on average 5-7 pages long) about dating, based on every negative stereotype about women you can think of. Not in a subversive way. In a \"all women are irrational, needy, jealous, gold diggers and being in a relationship with one is akin to being in prison ISN'T THIS HILARIOUS?\" type way. <br /><br />I don't really know what to say beyond this. I wanted to like the book. I even found a couple of the stories funny. But then as it went on they started to get meaner and meaner and I got angrier and angrier. But I finished it because I wanted to write about it. And it was a super quick read. So how's this. Instead of me writing down a coherent review I'll just write down some quotes I highlighted and my notes I took (heart you, Kindle) with a brief description of the story.<br /><br />Boy Meets Girl section<br />From \"Unprotected\"<br />It's the story of a condom that spends its life in his wallet.<br /><br />Other than the way the condom talks (\"I born in factory. They put me in wrapper. They seal me in box. Three of us in box.\") this story was pretty funny. Except I spent a good amount of time going \"Are you mad? You can't keep a condom in a wallet! That is going to be unusable. This is why we need better sex ed.\"<br /><br />From \"Magical Mr. Goat\"<br />OK, this is one of the few stories I liked. A little girl conjures up an imaginary friend who goes on adventure with her. But eventually Mr. Goat wants to be more than just friends and is hurt the little girl doesn't feel the same way and just sees him as a friend. Even if I think the \"friendzone\" is the stupidest thing ever, this was still pretty funny.<br /><br />From \"Occupy Jen's Street\"<br />\"It's outrageous,\" he muttered through gritted teeth. \"She refuses to go on a single date with me. Meanwhile, the fat cats on Wall Street just sit there, getting richer and richer.\"<br />I was confused.<br />\"What do the fat cats have to do with Jen?\"<br />\"It's all connected,\" he said vaguely.<br /><br />This was around the point I started to get worried about this book. This story is still pretty funny, but in a bit of a creepy way. It's about how this guy who is GREAT at leading protests decides to lead a full-scale protest outside of Jen's apartment until she agrees to go on a date with him. Overall the story is pretty funny, although you sorta just go with the idea that the woman in this story (and the women in ALL the stories) aren't actual characters. They're demonized or idolized. Cos then you get lines like this from the same story<br /><br />\"Ninety-nine percent of men are in love with the top one percent of women. And yet they often refuse to date us. It's a complete injustice.\"<br /><br />...ugh<br /><br />Boy Gets Girl section<br />I pretty much hated every story in this section and got angrier and angrier as I read on.<br /><br />From \"Scared Straight\"<br />\"His name is Dan Greenbaum. And he's been in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah, for seven years.\"<br />For the first time all day, Kyle felt his shoulders tensing up. He'd never actually met a real inmate before.<br /><br />My note:<br />\"ahaha yes, I get it. Relationships are a prison. And these boys are being shown what horrors could be in their future if they don't change their ways, a la Scared Straight. HILARIOUS. We're breaking some new ground now.\"<br /><br />From \"Center of the Universe\"<br />The story is about God having a needy girlfriend that gets annoyed with him for not showering her with enough attention cos he's busy making the world.<br /><br />My note:<br />\"ahaha, look at women being so demanding. Even God is whipped by them. If you try to have a relationship with them they will cut off your nuts. Why, this is even more hilarious than the last story\"<br /><br />From \"Girlfriend Repair Shop\"<br />His girlfriend would be diagnosed with some mental problem: depression, possibly, or something menstruation-related\"<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/oitnbpiper.gif\" /><br />My note, immediately after that quote:<br />This fucking guy<br /><br />This story is about a guy that goes to couples counseling with his girlfriend, but DON'T WORRY, he's fine. See all women are actually robots and she's not unhappy. She's just malfunctioning slightly. Tighten a couple screws and she'll forget all about her feelings. Hmm women as robots so they'll be perfect wives/girlfriends. Well isn't that just a TOTALLY ORIGINAL IDEA.<br /><br />From \"The Adventure of the Spotted Tie\"<br />Sherlock Holmes has a gold digging girlfriend that's cheating on him (AS WOMEN DO) and even though he's a genius he can't see that she's obviously just using him for his money. This fucking guy.<br /><br />From \"The Last Girlfriend on Earth\"<br />A disease wipes out all women on the planet except this one woman. Now all these guys want to hang out with her and her boyfriend is jealous because they all want to sleep with her and she is surprised these guys don't want to just hang out with her. Then it turns out there's a second girl and the first girl gets super catty and jealous LIKE WOMEN DO.<br /><br />OK, at this point I pretty much just started writing \"This fucking guy\" after every story. So maybe these quotes thing won't work anymore. But I'm sure you get the point.<br /><br />There's a final section called Boy Loses Girl with stories like the one about the secret agent that who uses the invisibility serum he's supposed to be using to track and take out a terrorist to spy on his ex girlfriend and fun stuff like that. There was one other story I liked called \"Man Seeking Woman\" that is funny and is also something like 50 words long. But it was too little, too late.<br /><br />I don't think all the stories should have nice to women or couldn't play off stereotypes (offensive and not) for the plot. But all of them? They all had to? Just...no. <br /><br />Title quote from page 52, location 488<br /><br />Rich, Simon. The Last Girlfriend On Earth and Other Love Stories. Regan Arthur Books, 2012. Kindle edition.

And then on my way home that night the train in front of me hit...somethingg and we were delayed. Which mean I had loads of time to do nothing but read and my phone was almost dead so I couldn't keep screwing around on there. And that's how I ended up crying on the train and DAMMIT, IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THAT WAY.<br /><br /><br />I would like to start this review by directing you over to <a href=\"http://theterribledesire.blogspot.com/2013/07/tell-wolves-im-home-hits-you-right-in.html\">Megs' review</a> because it says everything I want to say only better, and also is the main reason I picked up this book in the first place. Or at least the reason I added it to my TBR. Finding it on sale at Costco is why it got picked up.<br /><br />I know I already told you about how this book hits you in the feels, but it's in a good way. And that's not all there is to it. June is a misunderstood teen. I know what you're thinking, aren't they all? But June is. She's awkward and a loner, she used to be close with her sister but at some point they've grown apart. she wishes she lived in another time, specifically Renaissance time. She likes to wander into the woods behind the school, wear the special boots her uncle gave her and a Renaissance dress that's far too small and pretend she's actually a Renaissance maiden. So yeah, she doesn't have too many friends. But she has her Uncle Finn, so she's good. He understands her, lets her be who she is, and is always there for her. Until he isn't.<br /><br />Don't worry, that isn't a spoiler. It's the set up. Because when Finn is no longer there for June she finds someone else she'd never before met who misses Finn as much as she does.<br /><br />I know Megs did this too but it is really hard to talk about this book without some mild spoilers. They're spoilers that I don't think will mess up the book AT ALL if you haven't read it yet but in case you want to go in without knowing anything you should prob stop now. And then go read the book right now because it's really good. Really, really good.<br /><br />Really minor spoilers that you're probably safe to read but fair warning<br />June is torn by this stranger Toby turning up, because here is someone that knows all about a Finn she never knew. But it also means that she wasn't everything to Finn like Finn was to her. There were many times I wanted to yell at June for being so mean, but then again her angry, her defensiveness, her frustration, is understandable. Learning that she isn't the only one who misses Finn so much is both a blessing and a curse.<br /><br />The story isn't just about June and Toby. It's also June's family and their relationships. Particularly June and Greta, her great-at-everything older sister. And then there's June's mother and her relationship both with June and with her brother Finn. Everyone in the family is dealing with loss in different ways. And different losses.<br /><br />This book made me angry at the '80s. I guess it's hard to blame them. AIDS was a new disease and no one really knew much about it or how it was spread but just that if you got it, it wasn't good. And also you probably deserved what you got because you brought it on yourself because did I mention people are terrible? Because they can be. Especially when they're scared and confused. I have vague memories of a Sesame Street telling you all the ways you couldn't catch AIDS, like giving someone a hug.<br /><br />There's so much more I want to say but to do that will get into larger spoilers that I don't think would mess up the story if you already knew them but then again, who knows they might. So I'll stop talking about the plot.<br /><br />I already told you about the sads. I mean, it's a book about AIDS and death so of course it's sad but even these sads aren't the focus. It's about more than that. I wasn't angry at the book for making me cry. I was angry at the book for making me cry on the train, but that was really the fault with the book being so good that even though I knew the sads would be coming I had to read in, public be damned.<br /><br />I didn't realize this was YA while I was reading it. I really don't think I can pick out YA if asked to. It has a teenage protagonist but that's about it. Maybe that's enough? I guess I don't know enough about the genre, but yeah, if you're avoiding this one because you don't read YA you're doing yourself a disservice. It's also a quick read. Because you can't put it down. Even if you're now crying on the train.<br /><br />They originally thought it was a someone, which is happening with surprising frequency, but I'm guessing since we were only stuck for around 30 min that it was a something. They didn't say.<br />And apparently this is specifically a \"for Costco\" copy of the book. It even has a \"Dear Costco Readers\" thing from the author at the beginning.<br /><br />Title quote from page 354<br /><br />Brunt, Carol Rifka. Tell The Wolves I'm Home.

Not one about last names <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/wedding-plan-update-ramble\">like I mentioned last week</a> cos I need to give that more thought.

Except I just realized the show Cutthroat Kitchen is on OnDemand, so yeah, that's what I'm doing instead.<br /><br />Instead, here's another mashup of random thoughts!<br /><br />Vendor contracts<br />Whenever I google questions to ask various wedding vendors one of the questions that keeps popping up is \"Will I have a written contract?\" which...what? Yeah, I better get a written contract. I want everything in writing with both parties signatures that maps out everything: what's included, what's the cost, what are additional fees, what are the contingency plans. Who wouldn't provide this? Who wouldn't expect this?<br /><br />Asking about contingency plans is apparently also an unusual question. But seriously vendor, what's your plan if things don't go well? And no, I'm not talking about between me and Boyfriend+. What will you do if your equipment fails? If you get sick? I think we're like the buzzkills of this process. I mean these aren't the only questions we're asking, but are they really that out of the blue?<br /><br />Wedding albums<br /><a href=\"http://www.loniseye.blogspot.com/\">Loni</a> and I were going back and forth in the comments of the last post about wedding albums, so I figured I'd open this up to anyone else who may know. So wedding albums. Is this a normal thing? And I don't mean albums like you'd get for scrapbooking, where you just slide pictures in those plastic sleeves or pasted on pages. Everything I've seen so far in this wedding process has included these wedding albums where the pages themselves are the photos. You work with a photographer to design the album (picking photos, backgrounds, format) and then the thing is all bound. Is this a new trend? Maybe it's specific to Long Island?<br /><br />I also realized when thinking about these albums that I've never seen a friends wedding album. Not that I expect there to be a slideshow or anything, but I realized when I was trying to figure out if these wedding albums I've been seeing are a new thing that I've never seen a friend's album to compare.<br /><br />The most important wedding vendor<br />Obviously every vendor we talk to says they're the most important part of the night. Of course they do. They say \"Oh I'm not saying this because it's my business\" but yes, yes you are.<br /><br />Really in my mind, food &amp; drink is number one. Well that and the venue cos you have to have somewhere to do the drinking and the eating.<br />Then comes photography cos that's the part you're going to have forever.<br /><br />After those two, I'm less sure of what would come next. DJ? Maybe. I do think the music is important. Of course I've been to a wedding that was a lot of fun where they just used an iPod.<br /><br />The dress? Sure, I love my dress, but that's sort of something just for me. Or mostly for me. Given the popularity of all the TLC dress shopping shows other people like to look at it too. Of course the photography is pretty much just for me too, so I guess that's not a great reason. The dress is the first thing I got, so that says something to the importance.<br /><br />Flowers? I like flowers. If I couldn't use flowers at the wedding or something I'd be OK. It helps that there's a lot of flowers at the venue.<br /><br />Bridesmaids dresses? I want people to be comfortable,  I want them to look good, I want them to look like they're part of the wedding, but top importance? eeehhh<br /><br />What do you think?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:53+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:53+00:00","published_at":"2013-09-08T14:30:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224df95dde223867000239","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224df95dde2223b60000a6","title":"In a country that doesn't discriminate between fame and infamy, the latter presents itself as plainly more achievable","slug":"in-a-country-that-doesnt-discriminate-between-fame-and-infamy-the-latter-presents-itself-as-plainly-more-achievable","url":"/articles/in-a-country-that-doesnt-discriminate-between-fame-and-infamy-the-latter-presents-itself-as-plainly-more-achievable","body":"We Need To Talk About Kevin gave me stress headaches.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WNTTAKevin+cover.jpg\" />Or maybe it was the changing of the seasons since everyone around me seems to be getting sick and hit pretty hard with allergies. But since seasonal allergies have never bugged me before, I think the book is to blame.<br /><br />For those that don't know, We Need To Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriverg is about a school shooting, a la Columbine. Actually Columbine takes place not long after Kevin's attack on his school, and he's very upset to be overshadowed by those boys. And I suppose the story itself isn't really about the school shooting, although that is what happens and is the Kevin's mother Eva begins writing the letters to her husband. She talks about what it was like before they had Kevin, Kevin's childhood, and that Thursday, as well as stories set in present day when she goes to visit Kevin in prison.<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2012/09/we-need-to-talk-about-we-need-to-talk.html\">Laura</a> sent me her copy of WNTTAK and I had started to read it last December. Hey, do you remember what happened last December? So yeah, I put the took down and it took 8 months before I wanted to pick it up again.It's a disturbing disturbing book. Plus it reminded me what it was like to be in high school when all of those shootings were happening (and more than that the No Tolerance responses right after) since I was a freshman in high school when Columbine happened. As for the No Tolerance stuff, I remember telling a friend I had a dream she got sucked into an escalator. A teacher overheard and told me to be careful talking about stuff like that cos it could get me into trouble. This was a teacher that liked me so I guess she wouldn't rat me out for dreaming about sentient escalators, but yeah, it was a weird time.<br /><br />Sorry there are a lot of tangents in here. Back to the book.<br /><br />At first I was annoyed at the format of the book. Eva is writing letters  to her husband Franklin, but she's describing things that clearly he would know about. Except after the first couple letters I stopped  thinking about these being letters and realized even if Eva was  addressing these to someone, they were a journal for her. \"Talking\" to  Franklin gave her a way to try and come to terms with what Kevin did. <br /><br />So a big thing is the unreliable narrator. We're seeing things through her eyes, and they're her memories. And of course memories are unreliable (no matter what JK Rowling and the Pensieve may suggest) and Eva isn't the easiest person to like. That being said, I was expecting to HATE Eva cos, well, Laura did. And she wasn't expecting to. Perhaps it's those expectations that colored the book but really, anytime I started to think Eva was such a bad person, or that maybe she was lying about all these horrible things she saw in Kevin that Franklin missed I'd remember, but Kevin did end up committing this massacre. Maybe Eva was mistaken but then again, we saw what Kevin ultimately did so maybe she was right. Maybe she did see something that Franklin missed. And of course there were the stories of the neighbors accusing Kevin of terrible things. But again, we're seeing all of this from Eva's point of view, from her memories and what she's choosing to write down and share, so all interactions could be colored.<br /><br />There is of course the issue that Eva is not an affectionate mother. Not with Kevin anyway, though she describes her relationship with her daughter Celia as loving. But from the moment Kevin is born she never connects with him. I think this is what makes everyone really hate Eva. How could she NOT love her son right from the beginning? But then again, what if you don't? What if you have a kid and you don't feel all of the euphoria that you're supposed to feel? She tries to fake enthusiasm and maybe fake love for Kevin, but even Eva says Kevin sees right through it. Did this cause him to do what he did? Was Kevin a sociopath anyway, regardless of the type of mother Eva could have been? Or was Kevin a normal kid and it was Eva who saw all of these sociopathic tendencies and thus Kevin became what his mother always assumed he was? I think it was all of these questions that caused the stress headache. And of course we only ever see the story from Eva's point of view without much indication of what may or may not have actually happened.<br /><br />In the end, I don't really know how I feel about the book. I think it's extremely well-written. I was hooked. I was horrified. I couldn't look away. This was also a book that people stopped to ask me about. Right when I started it (I was something like 10 pages in) a woman on the subway asked me how I was liking the book. I think I gave her a blank look at first because \"EEKK why are people on the subway talking to me? Are my book and headphones not indication enough that I'm trying to ignore everyone?\" And also because I was like 10 pages in. So I told her I didn't know yet because, you know, 10 pages. She then told me how she had seen the movie because when she moved into her new home someone had left behind a copy (creepy) and that she thought the movie was very well done and she immediately gave it away cos she couldn't have it in the house with her. She also told me repeatedly how she had a son who was about 11 or so (she gave his actual age, I just don't remember) and how as a mother this really disturbed her. <br /><br />I don't know how to recommend this book. It's really well written but very disturbing. But not American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis or <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/a-true-zombie-would-be-mine-forever\">Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates</a> disturbing. It doesn't quite reach their \"I sorta wish I'd never read these books and not because their bad\" level of disturbing. But still, stress headaches. But I can't say that I'll never re-read this book again. So there you go. Real helpful review. \"Maybe read it or don't. Cos it's disturbing but kinda and also you may or may not hate the narrator.\"<br /><br />Who I had to look up to learn is a woman and not a guy. Which was pretty sweet because it made my monthly stats go up. Even though I spent some time going \"but I thought that's a guy's name. Like Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons or Lion-O from ThunderCats.\" Then I realized all of the Lionels I know come from cartoons and shut up, maybe it's a woman's name too. Then I finally read her Wikipedia page and it turns out she changed it to that cos she liked the more masculine sounding name. This clearly has nothing to do with the book.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\">Sandy Hook</a>. Sandy Hook is what happened<br /><br />Spoilers - all kinds of spoilers<br />And of course if you've read the book or maybe seen the movie (I dunno what the movie does) you know that she's not actually writing to her husband. Because Kevin killed him. So then you realize it really is just a journal. <br /> Spoilers over<br /><br /><br />I've only ever had someone stop me on the subway to ask what book I was reading and that was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban because Rowling brings people together.

I didn't realize just HOW long ago it was until I went through my posts. March 24 was the last wedding post, asking for help coming up with names for a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/bookish-centerpieces-i-need-your-help\">bookish centerpiece</a>. Well. Shit.<br /><br />In case anyone would like an update from that things are...well, not much further along than they were back in March. But now I'm at the point where the wedding is less than a year away, so I probably need to start making decisions. Something I am awful at.<br /><br />Here's what we have figured out so far:<br />Venue! - This is really the most important thing, at least in mind. Regardless of what else happens we have a location that will feed us and give us liquor. Everything else is a bonus.<br />Wedding dress - <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/wedding-dress-i-found-you\">Yup, that's done</a>. That one has been done for awhile. I think that should be coming in some time soon? Maybe? Probably something I should follow up on.<br />Bridesmaids' dresses - Hey, even this is done. Almost. I mean, I picked out one I liked and 2 out of the 3 bridesmaids were there to try it on. So we'll consider it 2/3rds done.<br /><strike>Officiant - All set!</strike> Unset. Did you know in the states of NY, FL, and VA a federal judge can't marry you? NY, do you really want to do the same thing Florida is doing? Think about that. No ship captains either. So I guess we need to figure this one out again. Dammit.<br /><br />So that's pretty much it. We're looking at photographers and DJs now. We went to this bridal showcase and...I just don't think I'm cut out for these things. There was a lot of eye rolling on my part. I can't help myself. We have appointments set up, people to be met with, and hopefully decisions will be done soon. Then it's onto the next thing which is...flowers, according to this wedding checklist. Also a lot of the items on this list tell me I should \"envision\" things, like the flowers and type of music and things like that. I think they put those on there so I can feel accomplished checking more things off. Nevermind all of the items on this to-do list that have big exclamation points next to them cos I haven't chosen the bridal party yet. (My side is done. Boyfriend+ is taking his time. I figure I'll find out who all is included on the wedding day.)<br /><br />I was going to ask those of you who have done the whole wedding thing about how long it took you to get your albumg, but actually I've been looking over the laws for getting a marriage license and holy hell, are there a lot of details. Here are some fun facts about getting married in NY state (NYC is a whole new can of worms that I'm not even going to bother with but let's just say, I'm happy NYC was out of my price range for a wedding)<br /><br />Did you know some states apparently require a physical before getting married? NY does not and that's good cos I'm not forking over a blood sample. Not for any reason that I think I'd fail, or that my DNA will show that I'm actually on the run after committing a series of bank robberies in Nevada or something. Just, screw you, you don't need my blood for this.<br /><br />Did you know you can get married at 14 in NY? Cos apparently, you can. You need written consent from parents plus a Supreme Court or family court judge, but still.<br /><br />You can't your marry a parent, sibling, aunt, or uncle. Cousins are cool though, apparently<br /><br />NY kicks ass in letting you choose what you want your last name to be Some states coughFloridacough say that only the lady can change her last name. And you can change your name whenever you feel like it, although your marriage license will say whatever you go with at the time. I plan on having a different post about figuring out last name, but I've already babbled about other things so I'll save that for it's own.<br /><br />No ship captains I don't really know what this means other than a ship captain can't officiate a wedding happening in NY state. If you were to get married not in NY (and thus have a license from somewhere else) and the captain officiated that, you'd be fine. I think.<br /><br />I apologize for the fact that this post is all over the place. Next time, I'll do a post about one wedding topic. Probably that name thing. And there will be less of a lag time between posts. Hell, these posts might pick up as I get closer and closer to the wedding and have stuff to report on.<br /><br />I sorta still asked that question, so if you have an answer, I'm all ears. I'm trying to figure out if the ranges people are telling us are totally reasonable or holy hell, what is taking so long?<br />I may have been watching too much Unsolved Mysteries lately","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:54+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:54+00:00","published_at":"2013-09-01T16:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224dfa5dde22386700023b","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224dfa5dde22fdcf00049d","title":"I've moved to a state the neighbors Idaho.

Because please, don't make the same mistake I did and just skip over this book. I don't know why. I mostly remember skimming blog posts when I saw they were talking about this book. Nothing against this book in particular. I skim past a lot of blog posts if the book isn't one I recognize or doesn't include something that catches my eye. I think it was also the Franzen blurb on the cover that made me shy away from it. So not only did I not pick up the book but I didn't really know anything about it. Then <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Alice</a> mentioned something about it taking place in Seattle and hey, I like Seattle. Plus I realized the whole I-don't-actually-know-anything-about-this-book bit and thought I'd look into it. And did you know the book is amazing? Because it is.<br /><br />Where'd You Go, Bernadette? is an epistolary novel for the most part. There are sections of straight narrative but for the most part the story unfolds through a series of emails and letters and magazine articles and invoices for a guy that does blackberry abatement. Sometimes I like this style. Other times I wonder why the person writing the letter would spell out a bunch of stuff that the recipient OBVIOUSLY knows and would never actually put in a letter. This falls into the successful bucket because Maria Semple knows what she's doing. Plus I love that we get to see the story, or at least specific events, unfold from lots of different perspectives. Not just what do different characters see, but also how are they telling their audience? A private email between two people is much different than a blast email going to all of the parents of Galer Street School. And Semple manages to make the characters sound different. I wouldn't mistake an email from Bernadette for a note from Ollie-O or a memo from Soo-Lin.<br /><br />So, the plot. Bernadette is mother to Bee, wife to Elgie, and that-crazy-lady to most of Seattle. She hates people and spends most of her time in the house, or better yet, in an airstream in the yard. She'd much rather have her virtual assistantg, Manjula located in India, do all of the basic day-to-day stuff. Since Bernadette and Elgie promised Bee she'd get whatever she wanted for her 8th grade graduation if she got straight A's (or straight S's for Surpasses Excellence because Galer St doesn't do traditional grades. I guess it's better than a crocodile for spelling.) she could have whatever she wanted. And she wants a trip to Antarctica. Bernadette may be dreading the trip with every inch of herself but she promised this to Bee, and Bernadette is nothing if not a devoted parent.<br /><br />But of course we have the title of the book so you probably realized things don't go as they were intended and Bernadette disappears. Again. I don't want to say too much. I don't want to spoil anything. I went into the book pretty much knowing it's told through letters and takes place in Seattle and that's it. I don't know if it would have made a difference to know more but I know I loved every new plot point. I don't think I could have anticipated a single one.<br /><br />Did I mention the book is funny? Because it's hilarious. I guess it helps that Semple was a writer for Mad About You and Arrested Development and, OK, the fact that she wrote for AD helped convince me that I should really pick this up. I started the book while I was at a beach house with some friends and I kept making them read a line here or there because Bernadette is the best. Even when she is railing on how much she HATES Seattle and Canadians. Her rambling emails to Manjula were some of my favorites.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book. As soon as I finished it I wanted to start it again. I may read it again soon. You should read it. Now. Right now. Are you reading it yet?<br /><br />These are totally a real thing. I would have laughed at the idea and assumed it was something made up because it's too ridiculous except I read about them in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/the-goal-is-that-youre-able-to-keep\">My Life as an Experiment by A.

How about a single plum, floating in perfume, served in a man's hat? Yes, that'll do.<br /><br /><u>Ereader or physical book:</u> It really doesn't matter. If it's a book I think I'll extra super special like, I try to get a physical copy. Or at least I did in the beginning. Considering I have both Attachments and Eleanor &amp; Park in ebooks I've given up that rule.<br /><br /><u>Fictional character that you probably would have dated in high school:</u> Sirius? Can I say Sirius even though that would have been a bit statuary. I don't think I read enough YA to give a non-illegal answer.<br /><br /><u>Glad you gave this book a chance:</u> Where'd You Go, Bernadette? by Maria Semple which for reasons I don't understand I was ready to pass on. Then <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Alice</a> mentioned something about it taking place in Seattle and I thought I GUESS I'll give this a chance AND THEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. Review coming and it will involve a lot of internet yelling.<br /><br /><u>Hidden gem book:</u> Fforde's Nursery Crime series because I feel like not enough of you realize how hilarious these books are. Or else Octavia Butler's Kindred. READ THEM ALL<br /><br /><u>Important moment in your reading life:</u> Starting this blog. It's been so wonderful and I've met so many great people and I am incredibly happy to have this little space.<br /><br /><u>Just finished:</u> Where'd You Go, Bernadette? and I kinda wanted to start it over again when I finished it because it's SO GOOD.<br /><br /><u>Kind of books you won't read:</u> text books? Not anymore anyway. There are genres I stay away from (romance...) but never say never<br /><br /><u>Longest book you read:</u> It's gotta be some Stephen King. IT was...well I was going to exaggerate and say 1000 pages but that exaggeration isn't great enough since I think it was closer to 1200 pages. Either IT or 11/22/63 since both of those books went on and on.<br /><br /><u>Major book hangover because of:</u> I'm blanking on a title. Probably because I was so traumatized. Let's go with Harry Potter, especially the end of this year's readalong.<br /><br /><u>Number of bookcases you own:</u> 9 and we need more. But some of those are small because Boyfriend+ was in denial of how many books I have and would acquire and we didn't just go with the full size ones to start with<br /><br /><u>One book you've read multiple times:</u> any of the Bryson books. I don't even know how many times I've re-read them<br /><br /><u>Preferred place to read:</u> might actually be the train, because it's good uninterrupted reading time. I love laying on my couch and reading but I'm easily distracted and my living room offers up many distractions.<br /><br /><u>Quote that inspires you</u>: I got nothing...<br /><br /><u>Reading regret:</u> That I get easily distracted and thus don't get more reading done. This isn't something I can blame on work or whatever. I mean, I could (I WILL) but really, a lot of the time I have some time to read and I end up doing something else, a lot of which is watch stupid TV.<br /><br /><u>Series you started and need to finish:</u> I don't read that many series so I dunno. I think there are some more books in the Thursday Next series but I haven't seen them in paperback yet. I'm still making my way through Game of Thrones but doing it slowly<br /><br /><u>Three of your all-time favorite books:</u> Lamb by Christopher Moore, The Well of Lost Plots by Jasper Fforde, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare abridged by the Reduced Shakespeare Company<br /><br /><u>Unapologetic fangirl for:</u> It's probably obvious by now but Fforde, Moore, Bryson. And also Rainbow Rowell. And some Caitlin Moran<br /><br /><u>Very excited for this release:</u> Ummm. Even though most of my reading is contemporary, I feel like I'm never anticipating a new title. They just sort of happen.<br /><br /><u>Worst bookish habit:</u> Feeling the need to finish a book even if I'm not liking it. I need to learn to let go<br /><br /><u>X marks the spot! start at the top left of your shelf and pick the 27th book:</u> You're saying I have to get up again? Which shelf? I went over before there are 9 of them. Fine, I'll just pick one. gets up again grumble/counts The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. I didn't try to pick a shelf that had fancy/impressive books. For example, another book on that shelf is Why Do Men Have Nipples? Also, there isn't too much logic to the organization of the books...<br /><br /><u>Your last bookish purchase:</u> Where'd You Go, Bernadette? Oh man, I feel like I'm talking this book up (even though this one is just asking which bookish thing did I most recently spend money on) my review better be worth it<br /><br /><u>Zzz-snatcher. Which book kept you up way late?:</u> I do very little reading late a night, instead spending my time watching TV or playing online. I have however spent a lot of time staying up late reading <a href=\"http://jennytrout.blogspot.com/p/jen-reads-50-shades-of-grey.html\">Jenny Trout's 50 Shades of Grey recaps</a> and they're hilarious.<br /><br />On a completely unrelated note, do you guys know the YouTube channel <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/pbsideachannel\">PBS Ideal Channel</a>?

First <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/he-rested-his-tired-head-against-steel\">Native Son</a> and now Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake. Don't worry, I've got all of the back-patting taken care of over here.<br /><br />But seriously, I am trying expand my reading horizons. And I was lucky enough to win a copy of The Namesake from Jennifer over at <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a> awhile agog and figured now was a good time to give it a try. I'd read Unaccustomed Earth a few years ago for my book/wine club and I'm like 90% sure I'd read an excerpt from Namesake in my American Lit II survey classes (cos the name Gogol rings a bell and yeah, bit of a unique name). So why not give the whole thing a try? It was excellent.<br /><br />There's no real plot to The Namesake. Gogol's parents have an arranged marriage and they come from Calcutta to Cambridge. They have Gogol and his younger sister Sonia and Gogol grows up and has some girlfriends and gets married and, seriously plot-wise, nothing happens. But that's cool because plot is not the point here. It's a character study, and I was sucked in.<br /><br />It's the story about being caught between two worlds, between too cultures and trying to fit in. It's about parents and children and families. It's about names.<br /><br />Tradition says that one of the family elders will name the children, in this case Gogol's maternal great-grandmother is given the task. When it's time to leave the hospital and Ashima's grandmother's letter has yet to arrive, the Ganguli's are forced to put something on their son's birth certificate. His father Ashoke picks Gogol, after his favorite author Nikolai Gogol. This name is never meant to be permanent. It's just his pet name, the name his family will call him. The plan is once the letter from Ashima's grandmother comes they will make the necessary updates and Gogol will have his \"good name\", the name he'll use outside the family. But the letter never arrives and come the first day of school Gogol won't answer to the good name his parents picked, Nikhil, and the school uses the name Gogol for all of his records.<br /><br />Gogol is obviously the main character here, but the story is not just about him. It's about his parents, before they came to America. It's about them clinging to old customs while at the same time embracing traditions of their new home. I loved the descriptions of the parties Ashima and Ashoke would throw, all of the food that they would make, their friends and their friends' families, other Bengali immigrants, everyone joined together by a common culture.<br /><br />I was surprised when I finished the book how much I enjoyed it. Especially now as I try to put it into words because there isn't much that happens, I can't say I particularly related to the characters, or even that I'd want to hang out with them. I always wanted to see what would happen next. I never found myself reading the same paragraph again and again because my mind kept wandering away from the story. When I realized I only had a few pages left I was sad to see it end. I don't know that it's a book I will return to again and again, but I enjoyed this journey through it.<br /><br />spoilers<br />One thing I wanted to mention that really has less to do with this book than it does with literary fiction in general is whyyy can't there be a relationship where the two people dating/married actually like each other? They are in love and sincerely want to be together. There are no affairs, there's no grand disappointment when the honeymoon period wears off and they realized they've made a mistake. This isn't to fault Namesake for having this happen, it's just when the affair did happen I couldn't be too surprised. Because no relationship can be happy in lit fic.<br />end spoilers and my rant<br /><br />Did I tell you I got the book? Because if I didn't, sorry about that.

At least when it's whimsy mixed with something strange. Christopher Moore said his first book was the result of someone telling him that you couldn't mix horror and whimsy, and he said \"Well, fuck that noise\" and wrote <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/are-you-sayingthat-human-race-was\">Practical Demonkeeping</a>. Or like Pushing Daisies which is bursting at the seams with whimsy, but there's also lots of strange stuff like a guy that can temporarily bring back the dead. So I guess I'm saying I don't like pure whimsy but instead whimsy cut with something dark. Can I tell you how much I liked the whimsy in Daniel Wallace's The Kings and Queens of Roam? Because it's a lot.<br /><br />In one way the story is about the McCallister sisters Helen and Rachel. The great-granddaughters of Elijah McCallister, founder of the city of Roam, Helen is the older homely sister, while Rachel is the beautiful but blind younger sister. The two sisters are never apart. Rachel relies on Helen for everything, which Helen simultaneously resets and requires. It began when they were small children and Helen switched faces with Rachel. Not literally, that would be a little too dark and not enough whimsy. Helen told Rachel that Helen was the great beauty of the family and it was Rachel who was ugly. People would tell her she was beautiful to make her feel better, because it's bad enough she's blind. This lie lead to a lifetimes of stories about how scary and dangerous the world is. When their parents die the sisters only have each other. Until that's not enough.<br /><br />But the story isn't just about the sisters. It's really about the dying city of Roam. It was once a prosperous city, a major manufacturer of silk. There's Elijah McCallister and his best friend/kidnap victim (SEE whimsy + something dark) Ming Kai. There's a lumberjack and his dog pack, the very-short-but-not-actually-a-midget bartender Digsby, the well-meaning but slow mechanic, Ming Kai's (great?) grandson Markus, and the town ghosts. It's about pasts, the stories we tell ourselves and others, about forgiveness and redemption. And did I mention the whimsy? I keep seeing people describe it as magical realism, but I really don't know much about that genre to say for sure if it is. It seems like it and these other people saying it seem smart, so let's go with that. This is magical realism.<br /><br />I've only ever read one other Daniel Wallace book, Big Fish. And I read that only after I saw the movie which I LOOOOOVED by the way. This is still the only movie I've seen where when it came time for the movie to end I got mad because I wanted more. I have been doing myself a disservice not reading more of his stuff, assuming it all has this whimsical quality. Because I really loved The Kings and Queens of Roam. It's sad and it's funny and I hated some characters but then I realized that the characters are too complex to just hate because there's so much more there. If any of those keywords I spouted out above (whimsy, magical realism, Big Fish, Pushing Daisies, loved, etc) connected with you, you should read this. Because it's so so good.<br /><br />Separate from the story, but I love the cover. Most of the time I honestly could care less about the book cover. Sometimes they draw me in but most of the time they really don't make a difference to me either way.g This cover though I love. I love the colors, I love the font, I love the silhouette, just the whole thing. I was going to say I don't know who did that but then I bothered to look at the fine print and read that it was Matt Curtius and while that name means nothing to me cos I don't know anything about book covers (see my comment about not normally caring) I feel like he should be pointed out cos this is so pretty.<br /><br />I also want to again point out how awesome Emma Dickey from Regal Literary is because I got a review request from her that pretty much prompted my post about <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/reviews-and-how-to-ask-for-them\">how to ask for reviews</a>. Hers did everything right AND it turned out the book kicked ass, which is really just a bonus for me. So yeah, in case it wasn't clear, I accepted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />There are obviously exceptions, and not just this one. I also loved the cover to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/im-wait-and-see-kind-of-girl-more\">Blackbirds</a> and hated the cover of another book that I accepted in exchange for a review, and since I didn't really love that book (and especially hated the cover) I won't mention it/link to it here. Because it would feel a big dead horse floggy.<br /><br />Title quote from page 275<br /><br />Wallace, Daniel. The Kings and Queens of Roam.

I can't remember exactly why it is I had this on my TBR list. I should really start making To Read bookshelves on Goodreads to keep track of this stuff. Anyway, I bought the book and then got intimidated by it so it now sat on my shelves. But then my shame at having a super white reading list finally pushed me to give this one a try. And it is intense.<br /><br />Native Son tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a black man living in 1930s Chicago. It's the story of racism and poverty, of feeling hopeless and trapped because that's the only way you've ever been allowed to feel. Of terrible, brutal, things that lead to other terrible, brutal things. And then there are lines like this:<br /><blockquote>He lay again on the bed, his mind whirling, with images born of a multitude of impulses. He could run away; he could remain; he could even go down and confess what he had done. The mere thought that these avenues of action were open to him made him feel free, that his life was his, that he held his future in his hands.</blockquote>And this<br /><blockquote>He would have gladly admitted his guilt if he had thought that in doing so he could have also given in the same breath a sense of the deep, choking hate that had been his life, a hate that he had not wanted to have, but could not help having.</blockquote>Like I said above, the book is intense. The treatment Bigger receives is horrible. Bigger's treatment of others is horrible. Everyone is horrible all over. There are moments of lightness, of happiness, but they come because of a death, of a graphic murder. (Which I thought about putting behind a spoiler warning before I realized it's on the summary on the back of my copy so blame Harper if you're mad at that.) I needed to take a couple breaks for Eleanor &amp; Park and People Who Eat Darkness because I needed something happy and something straightforward. This book is all shades of grey. And I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />I was expecting Bigger to be this innocent guy, caught up in a world that hates him. But he's not innocent. That would be too simple, too much of a melodrama. Of course this also means that I would find myself rooting for Bigger, hoping that he wouldn't have to face the consequences of his actions. Then I would get angry at myself for hoping this, which was usually around the time I needed to put the book down for awhile.<br /><br />There's a scene near the end of the book that is basically Wright's essay about Bigger's life and all of the things in the world that kept him and other black men and women down, and why under the current system, in the current world there is no hope for justice. This essay took me out of the story a bit but it's so good and makes so many good points that I sort of don't care.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this one. I don't see this being a book I re-read, but I'm glad I read it. I'm also glad I took breaks from it. I can't imagine what the reaction to this book was like when it was released in 1940.<br /><br /><br />Title quote from page 308<br /><br />Wright, Richard. Native Son. Harper Perennial, 2005.

Which is nice and I'm glad I'm thought of, even if it's in a very non-personal way, as someone who could read your book and actually influence other people to pick it up. Thank you for that. However, I tend not to read a lot of these books. Mostly because they don't sound like something I would be into and also because I have a zillion other books already on my TBR pile. I should go through and see how many of the review request I respond to versus the ones I actually receive, but I know so far this year I've only accepted 3 (I'm in the middle of reading one right now AND IT'S GREAT but I'll get to that later).<br /><br />That said, I think I have some advice for those who want to ask bloggers to read their book in a way that will annoy them the least. Or me. A way to annoy me the least.<br /><br />1. Get to know the blog - I know, you don't really have time for this. There are hundreds of thousands of book blogs out there, and it's unrealistic to read through all of their posts and really learn what that blog and blogger are like. But some top-line skimming would be nice. Something that indicates that you actually think this blogger would want to read your book, and that their audience would also like to read your book. Sending a paranormal romance to someone that only reads 19th century English novels is going to be a waste of everyone's time. If you can reference a specific review (even if that is the only post you read) that at least shows me you looked at SOMETHING on my blog.<br /><br />2. Avoid the email blasts - Or at least make them less obvious. This sort of goes with the first point of getting to know the blog. But seriously, when I see things that start \"Dear Blogger\" I zone out. I still skim the email cos there could be something interesting in there but most of the time, I just don't care. I know, email blasts are time-savers and LOTS of people use them. But at the very least, maybe use a program that can swap out the Blogger with the person's name (and I promise you, there are programs out there that do this).<br /><br />3. Use the blogger's name - Again, building on the point above, but when you start the email with my name instead of Blogger, I'm more apt to pay attention. I don't even care too much if you use Red instead of my actual name, though for those I've gotten that DO use my actual name, you guys get all sorts of bonus points. My name (it's Alley by the way) isn't hidden but it's also not obvious, so Red is fine. This doesn't mean I'll read your book, but it least makes me look more closely at your email.<br /><br />4. Check out if the blogger has a review page - This is a great way to see if the blogger is accepting books for review, if so what kind, if they want to do interviews, blog tours, all that fun stuff. Not everyone has them, but a lot do so check that out. <a href=\"http://whatredread.co/review-policy\">My book review policy page</a> isn't the most obvious (it's on the left side of the screen) but it's there. The majority of requests I get fall into the Deal Breaker list, which isn't helpful for anyone.<br /><br />5. Please no third person -  If you, the author, are emailing me directly, please don't write your email like you're someone else. This isn't a big deal, but I hate seeing \"This author blah blah blah\" and then the email is from the author. Just say \"I\"<br /><br />6. Yes, you have to give me a copy of your book - This one is actually part of the reason I wanted to write this list. I got a review request that ended with \"If necessary, I can send you a copy of my book.\" If what now? Yes, this is a necessary step. It's part of the agreement. I'll review your book and in exchange I get a copy of your book. You get a review, I get a free book. You might not get a review you like, but I may waste my time reading a book I don't like. That's how this goes. <br /><br />Now let me tell you about the best book review request I got. I sort of want to hug it, except it's an email. First up, she addressed it to me directly. My name even. So bonus points already. Then there is a quick description about the book and the author. I don't need 6 paragraphs describing the book. Tell me enough to get me interested. THEN (and this is the best part) she answered a question I asked in one of my reviews. Actually it wasn't even really a question. Sort of a random musing. Not only did the person skim through my blog but they read it closely enough to go \"Oh yeah, she sort of asked a question here, and I have the answer so LET ME SHARE\".g And now I'm not only reading The Kings and Queens of Roam but I was all excited to read it because of an excellent request exchange. (Also the book is good, so that is helping a lot.)<br /><br />Now granted someone can write a really kick ass request, and demonstrate that they've actually read my blog and still ask me to read a book I don't think will be my jam, but that's OK. Because the odds are we won't get to that point because the person will have a reasonable expectation of what I will like and thus will only send the request if it looks like it will be worth their time.  <br /><br />Any review request advice I missed?<br /><br />If you're curious, the question I had asked came from my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/im-dead-but-its-not-so-bad-ive-learned\">Warm Bodies review</a> about why there was an Audrey Niffenegger blurb on the cover. Turns out they're both represented by the same company so BOOM! Question answered.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:56+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:56+00:00","published_at":"2013-08-07T14:33:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224dfc5dde22fdcf0004a0","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"book review","slug":"book-review","url":"/articles/tags/book-review"}]}]},{"id":"53224dfd5dde226419000575","title":"At first the story was a puzzle, which developed over time into a profound mystery","slug":"at-first-the-story-was-a-puzzle-which-developed-over-time-into-a-profound-mystery","url":"/articles/at-first-the-story-was-a-puzzle-which-developed-over-time-into-a-profound-mystery","body":"One of the things I like about Goodreads is I can create my own bookshelves. There can be YA or non-fiction or fantasy, sure. But they can also be whatever I'd like to call them, which means I can make very niche shelves as I noticed certain reading trends. For example \"White guy problems\" or more specifically \"middle aged, middle class white guys having middle aged, middle class white guy problems\". Who knew that would be a theme for me? Now I've found another one: \"Tokyo true crime stories about the sex industry told by foreign news correspondents\". If you have any pithy name suggestions, let me know. Last time it was Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan by Jake Adelstein and this time it's People Who Eat Darkness:The True Story of a Young Woman Who Vanished from the Streets of Tokyo - And the Evil that Swallowed Her Up by Richard Lloyd Parry.g<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/People+Who+Eat+Darkness+cover.jpg\" />I first heard about this book sometime last year when <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2012/04/people-who-eat-darkness-by-richard.html\">Brenna from Literary Musings</a> read it and had good things to see. Then <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2012/06/richard-lloyd-parry-people-who-eat.html\">Ben from Dead End Follies</a> reviewed it, and again said all good things. So when I saw it was part of the Kindle daily deal I NATURALLY had to get it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />People Who Eat Darkness is, as I mentioned above, a true crime book. That crazy sub-title pretty much sums up what happens. Lucie Blackman, a young woman from England, travels to Tokyo in the hopes of finding work as a hostess, and disappears. Nine months later her body is found in a cave. (I'm not ruining anything for you. The description of the book tells you Lucie's fate.) Richard Lloyd Parry was a British journalist living and working in Tokyo at the time of Lucie's disappearance and something about the case draws him in. He spends ten years going over the details of the case, interviewing Lucie's family and friends, and other hostesses, eventually putting together this book.<br /><br />I powered through this book, especially the first half. It's fascinating. Much more than just watching a horrific crime unfold, you're entering into a different world. I mentioned above Lucie goes to Tokyo in hopes of finding work as a hostess in the Roppongi district, essentially Tokyo's red light district. But Lucie wasn't a prostitute, she never had sex with her clients and was never expected to. A hostess's job was to talk to men, light their cigarettes, pour their drinks, flatter them. That was it. Sure, the men could ask graphic sexual questions and yes, the work could be degrading, but it was never about having sex.<br /><br />Then there's the Japanese police force and court system, which is both very similar and very different from what we have in the states. Parry says a few times that Japan has very little crime, but that the low crime rates have more to do with a law abiding population and less to do with skilled police work. Not to say that the police are not trained or dedicated to their work, but that when you don't have much serious crime you don't have much experience investigating and prosecuting serious crime.<br /><br /> I wouldn't compare this book to In Cold Blood. You don't feel like you're reading a novel and that the people in it are characters. But that's fine. I spent a lot of the time reading In Cold Blood thinking about how so much of it is made up. I mean, sure, Capote had done a lot of research, had spend a lot of time interviewing people in the town, but that doesn't mean he knows exactly what happened in those last moments. People Who Eat Darkness sticks more to a \"just the facts, ma'am\" style.<br /><br />The book was excellent. It was heartbreaking to watch Lucie's family try desperately to find their daughter and deal with the bureaucracy that is the Japanese police force. It was fascinating to learn about Roppongi and the hostess culture. It was frustrating to hear about the police and what they couldn't do. And then there's the man accused of Lucie's disappearance. I can't say I've read a lot of true crime novels to compare this to, but that won't stop me from saying, this is better than typical true crime books and you should check this one out.<br /><br />If you'd also like to work in something but insanely long sub-titles, I think that works as well. OR I could make that a separate shelf just for that. Yes, that'll do.<br /><br />Title quote from location 285<br /><br />Parry, Richard Lloyd.

That is not fun. I don't remember agreeing to this. I guess it doesn't make that much of a difference since I'm not in school so summer doesn't mean vacation (necessarily) just that it's hot out.

I'm sorry I've been MIA this past week. Assuming you noticed.That's a little egotistical of me, thinking OF COURSE you've noticed my absence. Actually some of you may realize I was missing as I'm just now getting around to reading blogs and thus you're getting comments on things from last week. ANYWAY, I have been places that are not home, and thus I was not here.<br /><br />Boyfriend+ and I went down to South Carolina last week to visit my dad and see Charleston. I typically only make it down there for Thanksgiving and Boyfriend+ had never been since he's normally working during the holiday because sports, sports, sports. It was nice to get to show him the house AND we got to use the pool. We ate lots of good food which is always fun and the main reason I vacation. The weather was nice but hot and other than some glitches getting down there, it was a good time.<br /><br />Those glitches getting down there though. That sucked. Enough that Boyfriend+ put together an infographic because nerd. Would you like to see? Even if you don't want to, my blog<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Jetblue.jpg\" /> SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />If you're flying out of JFK, assume that every single person in the tri-state area will also be traveling at the same time, and also they've never flown before so the whole security process will be a new and exciting experience for them.<br /><br />To explain the pilot outing us thing. So we were supposed to have a 2 hour layover. Except with all of those delays, we were going to be landing about 2 minutes AFTER our connecting flight, which does not do us much good. We asked the flight attendant for our options since the pilot was still doing pilot stuff and we didn't know when we'd actually be leaving. She told us we could get off and try to find a different flight from JFK so we asked to do that. I don't know how many other people asked the attendant the same thing, but not long after that the pilot got on and made an announcement about how we were ready to push off but someone now wanted to get off the plane so we're going to be delayed even further. So then lots of people around us started grumbling and THANKS A LOT, JERK. There was extra grumbling when we got up, but a BUNCH of people also got off with us since people were missing meetings connections so at least we weren't the only ones.<br /><br />Before any of the mechanical problems and missed connections happened, JB told us they were going to be sending our bags right to our final destination, which was PERFECT. Except then they didn't do that at all and instead sent it to our connecting city. The one where we didn't go there cos we were going to miss the connection. Our bags missed the connection. THEN because my dad lives in the middle of no where, South Carolina, they were outside of the bag delivery area and told us they'd normally FedEx them overnight, which means out of our 4 1/2 day trip, we'd be without our bags for 2 days. There were some sad looks and they agreed to make an exception. And then the dogs swarmed the car when it came to deliver the bags and I bet they won't deliver out there again, even though the dogs are SUPER FRIENDLY AND THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY HI. Of course, I'm hoping that my bags don't get lost again, so hopefully this won't be an issue.<br /><br />So I also didn't get a chance to do the minireadathon that was yesterday (except I'm writing this on Sunday, so today. But I'm going to post this on Monday, so yesterday. Time travel is confusing.) I was sort of around but we had to do all of the I've-been-away-and-need-to-get-back-to-reality-even-though-reality-is-lame and do things like buy food and do the mountains of laundry that have been accumulating. But I am going through and reading everyone's mini-readathon posts and please know, I am very jealous of your good times.<br /><br />I will be around more this week and will hopefully have reviews to post and maybe I'll even finish Native Son (I will not).","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:57+00:00","published_at":"2013-07-29T13:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224dfd5dde22641900057a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"vacation time","slug":"vacation-time","url":"/articles/tags/vacation-time"}]}]},{"id":"53224dfe5dde22641900057b","title":"She looked liked art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something","slug":"she-looked-liked-art-and-art-wasnt-supposed-to-look-nice-it-was-supposed-to-make-you-feel-something","url":"/articles/she-looked-liked-art-and-art-wasnt-supposed-to-look-nice-it-was-supposed-to-make-you-feel-something","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Eleanor&amp;Park+cover.jpg\" />I don't know why I waited so long to read Elearnor &amp; Park. I have no excuse, no reason. I knew I would love it. Or I assumed I would given how much I looooved <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/he-said-he-preferred-armageddon-to-sams\">Attachments</a>. And pretty much all of my blogging buddies loved the book. I had so many reasons to read the book immediately and none to put it off. But I did. For months. For seriously no reason whatsoever. Maybe I was saving it for a time I thought I'd need it.<br /><br />I was (and still am) in the middle of Richard Wright's Native Son which is very good but also very intense. I needed a break but didn't know what to go with and thought this would be the perfect time to pick up a book that I would love. Something I could power through. And I finally picked up Eleanor &amp; Park. And I loved it. Loooooooooooooooved it. I'll try to keep the gushing to a minimum.<br /><br />Eleanor &amp; Park is a YA (blah) love story (double blah) but it's so good. I'd say it's unlike any other YA love story, except see those \"blahs\" above, so I don't really have a good baseline comparison. That said, I'll go ahead and say that this is unlike other YA love stories. Eleanor and Park (and Park's parents, and Eleanor's siblings) feel so real and they dance on cliches without ever falling into them.<br /><br />It's a romance between two people from different worlds, but no one in Park's world is keeping him from Eleanor. And those in Eleanor's world are keeping her from everyone, not just Park. And by \"those\" I mean, her asshole alcoholic abusive asshole stepfather. Asshole.<br /><br />Before I read the book I pretty much just knew that Eleanor is a big red-head (the kids call her Big Red) and poor and no on likes her, and Park is half-Korean, but managed to be popular. It takes place in Omaha in 1986 and involves good music and comic books. I knew it was about teenage love but it's more than that. It's about first love and the intensity in every touch and every look.<br /><br />I don't really know what else to say that isn't going to devolve into just \"OMG THIS IS SO GOOD ARE YOU READING IT YET WHY AREN'T YOU READING IT READ IT\" But if you need some other reasons to read this (as if me yelling it at you wasn't enough reason) then enjoy these quotes. And know it took me forever to figure out which quotes to include because I highlighted so many<br /><blockquote>All [Eleanor's mother's] bones seemed more purposeful than other people's. Like they weren't just there to hold her up; they were there to make a point.</blockquote><blockquote>[Romeo &amp; Juliet] was 'Oh my God, he's so cute' at first sight. If Shakespeare wanted you to believe they were in love, he wouldn't tell you in almost the very first scene that Romeo was hung up on Rosaline....It's Shakespeare making fun of love,\" [Eleanor] said.<br />\"Then why has it survived?\"...<br />\"Because...\" [Park] said quietly, looking at his desk, \"because people want to remember what it's like to be young? And in love?\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Nobody gets enough,\" [Park's mom] said. \"Nobody gets what they need. When you're always hungry, you get hungry in your head.\" She tapped her forehead. \"You know?\"<br />Park wasn't sure what to say.<br />\"You don't know,\" she said, shaking her head. \"I don't want you to know...I'm sorry.\"</blockquote><br />Please also know that I took 2 notes while reading:<br />\"OMG I fucking love Eleanor<br />\"Aaand now I love Park.\"<br /><br />Also, I was excited for a red-headed lead. I didn't realize I'd be so excited to learn that she also has brown eyes. But I was. Enough to bug Rowell on Twitter with lots of exclamation points that she made a red-headed, brown-eyed character because SERIOUSLY, NOT ALL RED HEADS HAVE GREEN OR BLUE EYES. (Oh are you wondering if my eyes are dark brown? Maaaaaaybe.)<br /><br />I loved this book. And warning, it made me cry, or at least tear up. On the subway. But it was so good it was OK.<br /><br />Title quote from page 165, location 2427<br /><br />Rowell, Rainbow. Eleanor &amp; Park.

That's a thing? That sarcastic monster love story joke is an actual movie? And John Malkovich is in it? I don't really know what to make of this.\" But then the movie actually got good reviews. Whoda thunk? Then I started seeing reviews of the book and they were also good. So when I was on my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/my-book-buying-hiatus-and-how-well\">just-browsing-but-definitely-not-buying-anything</a> trip to the local bookstore I picked up a copy. I was listening to the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/world-war-z-listening\">World War Z audiobook</a> so I was on a zombie kick.<br /><br />With Warm Bodies you have to forget everything you know about zombies. Not like in a \"This will challenge you in new ways!\" type thinking, but because pretty much every basic detail about zombies (they are unthinking, the change is permanent, they don't remember anything of their former life) is disregarde.  At first it was sort of hard for me to accept this. I kept thinking \"But wait? How can they talk? They're not people anymore\" and had to stop and realize this is a different story. And come on, it's not like this is more or less realistic than any other zombie story because zombies aren't real so shut up already.<br /><br />Warm Bodies is indeed a zombie love story. Our main character is R. He can't remember his full name, but the fact that he can remember anything is pretty good for the walking dead. He lives at the airport with a bunch of other zombies. They wander around, ride the escalators, teach their \"children\" how to eat brains, and go on hunts. They can even talk...kinda. Already these aren't the mindless zombies from other stories. But they're still zombies and they still eat brains and you'd think that right there would make it pretty hard to set up a love story between a Dead and a Living.<br /><br />When a zombie eats a persons brain they temporarily experience that person's life. They see their memories and for a moment they get a glimpse of what it was like to be alive. When R eats the brain of a man named Perry he sees Julie and something changes. Instead of attacking her he saves her. He smears blood on her to hide her from the others and she brings her back to the hive. Sure, she's a prisoner at first but there's something going on there.<br /><br />It seems dangerous to make a zombie the main character because how much depth can a zombie have? But R works wonderful to lead us through his world. He wants to remember what happened to him. He wants to remember his name and the names of the others. He wants to remember to talk and laugh and live.<br /><br />And of course then there's Julie. There is something about her the causes this shift in his being. But she's not this up-on-a-pedestal too-good-to-be-true-and-ultimately-really-boring woman. She has flaws and she's tough and she's scared and she's brave. This isn't a story about a woman's love ultimately saving a guy. There's something in the bond between the two of them that they don't understand that causes things to veer off course.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one. It was funny and touching and there was a surprising depth to the characters, given it is a zombie love story. That said, I'm still confused why there's a blurb from Audrey Niffenegger (she of <a href=\"http://things%20get%20kind%20of%20circular%2C%20when%20you%27re%20me.%20cause%20and%20effect%20get%20muddled/\">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>) on the cover of my copy. It doesn't seem to that their audiences would necessarily have a lot of overlap.

Which granted, it's been a few months but in my world that's lightning speed. So apparently I've decided to start this post by almost apologizing and taking it back at the last second. I'm sorry about that. (Not for taking so long but for taking back my apology. But I ended up making one in the end so I think we're good.)<br /><br />Back in May I got an email asking me if I wanted to read David Michael Slater's new book Fun &amp; Games. The authors other books are mostly kid's books so I can't say I was familiar with him (and Goodreads didn't even list this book until I was just about done reading it, which I thought was odd) but the email said it was for fans of David Sedaris and Jenny Lawson and it takes place in the '80s. Impossible to turn down such a pitch.<br /><br />Fun &amp; Games is the story of Jon Schwartz and his more-messed-up-than-it-initially-seems family life. We follow Jon from the evening before he's to be bar mitzvahed until he's in hanging out with Foucauldians in college. His grandparents are Holocaust survivors. His grandfather copes by hiding food everywhere and his grandmother by telling offensive Jewish jokes. His mother writes ad copy and his dad is a famous author who hates religion and values logic to an illogical point. His eldest sister Nadia flunked out of high school but appears to be a manipulative genius and his other sister Olivia sees herself as a virginal sex object.<br /><br />Really with all of that, you almost don't need a plot. There is one, don't worry. Or rather, there's more events put into motion when Jon's grandmother comes to his Hebrew class and tells some of her jokes. Or rather, Jon tries to stop her from telling her jokes, which gets him in trouble. From there a Rabbi's ankle is broken, Olivia gets into some strange (and illegal given her age) sex things, Nadia goes off to college which is odd for someone who never graduated high school, Jon and his friends learn to shot gun beer (there's a lot of practice involved) and things start to fall more and more apart.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book. Up to the ending, but I'll get to that in a bit. I found myself laughing at the antics Jon and his friends and family get into, although I don't know that I would say this books is first and foremost a funny one. Which I know, is confusing given the comparison to Lawson &amp; Sedaris, and even my description above. It has it's funny moments, but the book is a lot more serious and a lot darker than it appears at first. I really liked the characters. I do wish the focus had been more on the family instead of the friends, but I could also relate better to his two sister than I could to the pack of adolescent boys, so go figure.<br /><br />I did LOVE the scenes when Jon was at college taking a Literary Theory class, though that is mostly because of nostalgia. Either every professor teaches the deconstructionalists the same way or we had the same professor because all of the tuff about cat and cap and bat and words being meaningless, I could feel my brain melting. I honestly don't know how I passed Lit Crit (at least the fundamentalists and deconstructionalists and other Russian-ists that made my brain hurt. I was on sturdier ground with Gender Theory) but I know that I am apparently an excellent bullshitter as I managed to do pretty well in the class while never understanding a single thing. I used to come out of class babbling nonsense, which my friend told me was amusing so there's that too. Things Lit Crit gave me.<br /><br />This book felt like the prequel to one of the \"middle class white guy problem\" books in the vein of Jonathan Tropper or Matthew Norman. It's like the \"before they were middle aged, see what their messed up teen years were like\". Considering I've made a Goodreads list for this MCWGP category, I'm not saying this is a bad thing. Well, I guess it could be a bad thing if you don't like that category.<br /><br />Now. The ending. The book takes a serious left turn in the last few chapters that made me think the author was writing the same story with two entirely different tones, and then accidentally mixed up the endings in the final draft. There are hints that things are a lot darker than they initially seem, even early on. One night early in the book Nadia convinces Olivia that they should learn to make guys get off super fast, before anyone is out of their clothes, to essentially avoid being raped on prom night. And that...that is super messed up. So I guess given that right in the beginning I should have been prepared for the ending. But honestly, each of those hints (there weren't many) felt jarring when it happened. Like it didn't fit with the rest of the story. And then that ending. So I can't tell you the ending without giving away...well the ending (obviously) but it didn't work for me. It didn't fit with the tone, it was so much darker than the rest of the story suggested, no. Want to know what happened? OK<br /><br />gspoilers<br />The story, which until this point was fairly light hearted (save for a few of those hints) ends with a beat down, a gang rape, a double homicide and a suicide. And this is how it ends. This is what you're left with. I didn't take too many notes while reading but my comment for this part was \"What the holy fuck\" because I didn't expect any of this. I felt like I picked up a different book, except all the characters had the same names.<br />spoilers ovah<br /><br />So, most of the book I enjoyed. It was funny and serious and ridiculous while being just this side of believable. the ending however. No thank you.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Title quote from page 202<br /><br />Slater, David Michael. Fun &amp; Games.

Actually, that was the second time I had read the book. I'd read it once before I started this blog but I loved it SO MUCH that I wanted to read it again so I could talk about it on here.<br /><br />Oh, would you like to read those early days posts? Sure, why not.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-goes-by-many-names-crisis-dark-years\">It goes by many names: \"The Crisis,\" \"The Dark Years,\" \"The Walking Plague\"</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/who-in-his-right-mind-could-have-been\">Who in his right mind could have been ready for this?</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/couldnt-just-one-restart-plague-all\">Couldn't just one restart the plague all over again?</a><br /><br />Over the years I have read some positive things about the WWZ audiobook. Because the book is made up of a series of interviews, they got a series of authors to read for the different characters. Henry Rollins, Nathan Fillion, Alan Alda, Common all took a character. At this point I wasn't super into audiobooks but this sounded like something I should try. Alas my \"I should try this\" basically means \"if this falls into my outstretched hands, I will give it a listen.\"<br />A few years go by and I do no WWZ listening.<br />Then this year I took part in that <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/harry-potter-readalong-it-begins\">super kick ass Harry Potter readalong</a> and I ended up doing about 3/4 of that readalong on audiobook (listen along?) which worked out very nicely for me. One, I had all the books on audio (or rather, my mother did and she lent them to me). Two, I would just put the chapters I was supposed to read on my iPod. It really helps when you want to continue on with the story but you CAN'T because you don't actually have the rest of the story with you. Three, I would listen to HP during the subway portion of my commute. Because it's the subway, there's not always space for me to stand and hold a book. Listening to an audiobook was much easier. Sure, it took me longer to listen to the books than it would take me to read them, but that's fine. <br />I found that I really liked listening to audiobooks and went on the hunt for some more. Boyfriend+ and I were at B&amp;N when I saw the WWZ audiobook and on sale. Happiness and joy. I was about to bring it up to the register when I remembered my mom's advice and checked the fine print. I was disappointed to read the work \"Abridged\". Bastard. What kind of BS is this?<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jstewangry.gif\" /><br />Disheartened, I put the audiobook back and do some Googling when I get home to see if an unabridged version exists. Sadly it does not. But what's this? An update on Max Brooks's website that, due to the movie coming out this summer (perhaps you'd heard of it) they're releasing a NEW UNABRIDGED VERSION of the audiobook. They were getting actors back who had to read follow bits and it would be released sometime in the summer. Happiness! Except, the site hadn't been updated in awhile. And there were no pre-orders to be found. Whomp<br />Sometime in April <a href=\"http://www.entomologyofabookworm.com/2013/04/my-first-dewey-readathon.html\">Kerry over at Entomology of a Bookworm</a> mentioned she was listening to an unabridged copy of WWZ and I did a Scooby Doo double take<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/prdoubletake.gif\" /> Or a Paul Rudd DT. I asked her where-oh-where she procured such a copy. It was going to be available in May so I shot an email over to Brother (he who lent me his book copy of WWZ) that said \"Hey, did you ever buy me a b-day gift? Cos if not, buy me this.\" He answered that he did not, and I would be getting the audiobook as soon as it was available.<br />I realize this has been a lot of post without once mentioning anything about the audiobook. If you clicked on the other WWZ links, you'll notice that apparently that is a theme with these posts. Anyway the audiobook, how was it?<br />It kicked ass. I couldn't wait to start listening to it. I listened to it on my commute. I shunned watching Daria in place of listening to it while riding our exercise bike. It was a different experience from reading the book.<br />First up, the voice actors are great. I did spend a lot of time trying to guess who each person was. Some were obvious (Carl Reiner as the elderly Israeli man) some less obvious (Simon Pegg a Texan politician shoveling manure), but I liked them all. Martin Scorsese as the guy who created the fake vaccine was THE BEST. When I saw his name on the list of actors? readers? I thought/hoped he would read that story. Not that I mean to say the character Breck reminds me of Scorsese, just that I thought he would do a great job with that character. And he did so I was right. I've read complaints that a lot of the characters in the book sound the same. The mere fact of having different people read for each character helped this tremendously. Sure, there are still similarities, but it didn't bother me.g<br />I also noticed while listening to the audiobook is how infrequently the zombies actually make an appearance. When I've read the book, I would constantly think about the zombies. I had loads of zombie nightmares. But while listening I was more focused on the characters and how shitty things had gotten for them. There are a couple brief instances where the characters relate actually fighting a zombie but for the most part the book deals with how the world is coping with this global disaster. The zombies aren't the focus a lot of the time. They're just the catalyst for things being so so shitty. Which is sorta why I like the book so much. Zombies are a part of the book, but there is so much more to the story than them.<br />I loved this audibook. I will be listening to it again, probably before the year is out, because I don't have that many audiobooks and also THIS WAS SO GOOD. Just, if you're going to listen make sure you pick up the unabridged version. I haven't listened to the abridged one but why would you do that one when an unabridged one exists? Exactly.<br />I'm also not bothered by the fact that every character in an Aaron Sorkin show sounds exactly the same. As long as I'm entertained, I can let a lot of things slide.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:59+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:31:59+00:00","published_at":"2013-07-12T13:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224dff5dde22fdcf0004a2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"audiobooks","slug":"audiobooks","url":"/articles/tags/audiobooks"},{"value":"Max Brooks","slug":"max-brooks","url":"/articles/tags/max-brooks"},{"value":"World War Z","slug":"world-war-z","url":"/articles/tags/world-war-z"}]}]},{"id":"53224dff5dde22386700023c","title":"Goodreads, you have confused me","slug":"goodreads-you-have-confused-me","url":"/articles/goodreads-you-have-confused-me","body":"Goodreads was bought by Amazon, right?

It was 'Merica's birthday last week which meant the days leading up to the 4th were very busy, and then the 4th and onwards were busy while I ate grilled food and got sunburned. So you know, I celebrated it the traditional way. Anyway, review time.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/metalkpretty.jpg\" />I finally, finally, finally got around to reading some David Sedaris. I don't know why I put him off for so long. He always seemed like someone I would enjoy. I'd gotten multiple recommendations to check him out. And yet, much like other books I'm positive I'll love (Eleanor &amp; Park...) I just keep putting them off. I don't know the reason. Maybe I'm worried that I won't love it and then what?<br /><br />Someone (and if it was you, please let me know because I know it was from some book blog) had recently read a Sedaris book. I'm not sure which one. But anyway, they recommended starting with Me Talk Pretty. And what do you know? I found a copy of Me Talk Pretty on sale. Stars aligning and whatnot.<br /><br />Sedaris is funny and he' writes like he knows it, but that's fine. He's funny enough that he gets away with it. He writes about his past drug use (but in a very light hearted way), his life in France, and his family, whom I assume are cool with his sharing. He talks about his dad's strange jazz obsession and insistence on eating rotten food. He talks about trying and failing to learn French and spending most of his time in Paris going to see American movies. My favorite stories involved his sister Amy and if he could just write an entire collection about her, that would be terrific. But really, when he talks about how she wore the bottom half of a fat suit to Christmas dinner (I think that was the holiday) one year, how can you not love her?<br /><br />Overall I didn't feel that the stories don't build upon themselves on some greater theme. Really, it's just a bunch of hilarious things that happened to him, usually because he caused the ridiculousness that falls upon him. He was a performance artist on meth so really, it was either ridiculousness or tragedy that was going to befall him.<br /><br />It only took me about 2 days to get through this book, and I was so sad when it was over. I read some reviewsg that talked about how some of the experiences were embellished or just flat out made up. I don't know how true that is, though I wouldn't be surprised. That said, I don't really care all that much. The essays are entertaining, and I prefer that to sticking to the strict (and possibly boring) truth.I also read reviews where people said he was pretentious. Maybe a little but how pretentious can you be when you're talking about going to the movies (any movies, not just art house ones) is just as cerebral as reading because everyone is lazy and have decided to collectively lower the bar? Perhaps Sedaris's audience is pretentious, but his essays were never insufferable. He seems like he could be, but his writing was fun.<br /><br /><br />And now, if I may share my favorite story which actually takes place within one of my favorite essays \"Picka Pocketoni\"<br /><blockquote>I'd been riding the Chicago el with my sister Amy, who was getting off three or four stops ahead of me. The doors opened, and as she stepped out of the crowded car, she turned around to yell, \"So long, David. Good luck beating that rape charge.\" Everyone onboard had turned to stare at me. Some seemed curious, some seemed frightened, but the overwhelming majority appeared to hate me with a passion I had never before encountered. \"That's my sister,\" I'd said. \"She likes to joke around.\" I laughed and smiled, but it did no good. Every gesture made me appear more guilty, and I ended up getting off at the next stop rather than continue riding alongside people who thought of me as a rapist.</blockquote>See why I like the Amy stories the best?<br /><br />I want to read more Sedaris, though I worry that his other books may not  live up to this one. But, I'm willing to risk it. If anyone has a  Sedaris to try next, I'm all ears.<br /><br />I recommend reading some of the Goodreads reviews of this almost as much as I recommend the book itself. At least the ones with 3 or less stars because the amount of visceral hate this book caused is incredible. And confusing.<br /><br />Title quote page 37<br /><br />Sedaris, David.

He seems like the type of author I would like. I was warned against American Gods as a starting point, but this was the book that was on sale one day, so this is what I went with. It's too bad I can't pass up a sale.<br /><br />The basic plot, as best I understand it, is the old gods of mythology live all over America but their power is based on their believers. There aren't many contemporary Americans that believe in ancient Egyptian gods. Most people worship the new gods of technology and media. Shadow, an ex-con, becomes a bodyguard for a man named Mr. Wednesday. He's lost everything so why not be the bodyguard for some stranger he met him a bar. Oh and the stranger seems to know more about Shadow than he lets on.<br /><br />Shadow and Mr. Wednesday travel around America meeting with the old gods to convince them to battle the new gods. Gods that I mostly didn't recognize. I am apparently not up on my old-time gods. There are also a number of side stories, explaining how some of these gods made their way over to America, showing how things are for them now. I liked these subplots more than the main story.<br /><br />I felt like the main story was trying to make very deep and important points, and I just wasn't following them. I found myself having trouble focusing, or not really caring if I picked up the book again or not. I liked the main character, and when I think about the idea of the plot, I like it very much. But in actual execution I was bored. Bored and lost. I kept feeling like there was something else there that I wasn't getting. But I also didn't feel like I cared so much that I was missing it.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been a series of short stories. Maybe about the gods coming to America, about their powers waning as people move away from them, about their attempts to grow in importance. Because while I liked moments here and there overall I was sorta...eh on it.<br /><br />The moments and a few quotes are the reason I'll give some more Gaiman a try but this one was a miss for me. Alice, you were right and I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.<br /><br />To end this on a positive note, here are some of the quotes I liked<br /><blockquote>\"It's almost hard to believe that this is in the same country as Lakeside,\" [Shadow] said.<br />Wednesday glared at him. Then he said, \"It's not. San Francisco isn't in the same country as Lakeside any more than New Orleans is in the same country as New York or Miami is in the same country as Minneapolis.\"<br />\"Is that so?\" said Shadow, mildly.<br />\"Indeed it is. They may share certain cultural signifiers - money, a federal government, entertainment; it's the same land, obviously - but the only things that give it the illusion of being one country are the green-back, The Tonight Show, and Mcdonald's.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Have you thought about what it means to be a god?\" asked the man. He had a beard and a baseball cap. \"It means you give up your mortal existence to become a meme: something that lives forever in people's minds, like the tune of a nursery rhyme. It means that everyone gets to re-create you in their own minds. You barely have your own identity any more. Instead, you're a thousand aspects of what people need you to be. And everyone wants something different from you. Nothing is fixed, nothing is stable.\"</blockquote>Next time I decide to give Gaiman a try, what should I go for? Or what should I avoid?<br /><br />Title quote from location 4749<br /><br />Gaiman, Neil. American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition. William Morrow, 2011. Originally published 2001.

The last Harry Potter Friday. The final wrap up post after this 6 month readalong. How nuts is that? 6 months of reading and writing about Harry Potter. That is crazy impressive. Especially when I think way back to when this readalong was first suggested and the thought of committing to anything for 6 months was crazy. How am I going to stick with it? Now I don't know what I'm going to do next Friday. Who is going to listen to thoughts about wizarding plumbing?

I know it would have been ridiculous and the tone would have been wrong but SIRIUSLY how badass would that have been?

Please enjoy this rambling instead.\" And hey, here's another one!<br /><br />Also I feel like I haven't been visiting other blogs so much this week but things have been CRAAAAZY busy at work, which always seems to be what happens whenever I start Monday thinking \"Hey, this week looks like it will be really light.\" I need to stop doing that. The problem is I have less down time than usual to pop on to blogs while I'm in the office, and then by the time I get homeg the last thing I want to do is have to read and understand something and then form a coherent thought in response. Instead I've spent a lot of my time playing Dots.The music when you complete a box is very satisfying.<br /><br />While on the train home today I read a <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-5-most-unjustly-overshadowed-sci-fi-classics/\">Cracked article all about sci-fi books that you're probably missing out on</a>. Now obviously, I read a lot of Cracked. And link to a lot of their stuff here. I should probably get paid or get a t-shirt or something for all this free advertising I'm sending their way. This article especially won me over in the intro when Brockway pointed out how few book related posts they do<br /><blockquote>\"Perhaps there's good reason for the lack of book-themed content. Perhaps you, as casual Internet readers, don't care about books. Perhaps you, as casual Internet readers who don't care about books, should go fuck yourselves.\"</blockquote>Already, we're starting this off on a good foot. And I mean this sincerely. I was still a little worried about what books would be listed or if they'd be anything I'd be interested in.  I mean, Cracked tries, but they're primary audience is guys and not necessarily the most sophisticated ones. Who's to say any of the books they'd recommend would be an interest to me at all? Guess what? They win and I now have 5 sci-fi books I want to check out.<br /><br />There's a Murakami on the list AND 2 out of the five books feature a female protagonist. My heart soars a little bit when I see that because, honestly, how many female protagonists are there in sci-fi? Probably more than I assume but given all the <a href=\"http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/06/19/the-silent-majority-fear-of-sexism-is-a-misogynists-best-friend/\">crap going on with sci-fi and female authors</a> right now, I think not enough is a safe answer.<br /><br />The list isn't perfect. No list of \"books you should check out\" ever will be. I wish there could have been some Butler on there, although she wouldn't have necessarily fit on this list since they were looking for less well-known books from well-known authors and Butler isn't well known enough. Yet. Though she really should be and I was happy to see someone recommended her in the comments.<br /><br />Go check out the list, enjoy the Duck Tales reference, and add at least one of these books to your TBR pile because at least one of them has to strike your fancy.<br /><br />Updated to include the names of the books on the list, even though it's only 5 of them and you should go read the article so you hear the reasoning behind why read these. But anyway<br />5. Idoru by William Gibson<br />4. The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick<br />3. Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World by Haruki Murakami<br />2. The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson<br />1. Kalki by Gore Vidal <br /><br />When the trains aren't busy derailing and messing up the whole \"getting home\" part of my day<br />I am linking to one post on Chuck Wendig's Terrible Minds blog, written by guest writer Karina Cooper, gives a good overview of all the crap going on, as well as lots of links out to other pieces you should probably read.

Good times.<br /><br />I get down there and figure I'll pop by the bookstore. But I've told myself I don't want to buy anything right now cos I have a whole bunch of books sitting on my shelf that I really need to get to.  But what's the harm in seeing what they have? Here's the internal/text conversation I had<br /><br />I'll just see what they have on the remainder tables. Probably nothing new just yet. Oh hey, what's this? A Visit from the Goon Squad audiobook, and only $10? Well now, that's interesting. And Boyfriend+ has been looking for an audiobook to listen to while in the car. I should see if he'd like this.<br /><br />:text to BF+: \"Visit from the Good Squad $10 audio. You want?\"<br /><br />Well, now I need to wait to see if he wants it, so I'll browse around a bit. <br /><br />Hmm good, it looks like all of the books I would want on the remainder tables I either have or I've read. Maybe I really won't buy anything. I mean, I was killing time in B&amp;N the other day and didn't get anything. That was good.<br /><br />:text from BF+: \"Never heard of it\"<br /><br />Never heard of it?? How can that even be? Oh right, there are some people who don't spend a significant portion of their free time reading about the book world. Well fine then<br /><br />:text to BF+: \"If you read my blog you'd know it\"<br /><br />Wait, that's mean. I can't send just that. But how do I describe it in a text?<br /><br />:text to BF+: \"If you read my blog you'd know it. Won the Pulitzer a couple years ago. Interconnected short stories\"<br /><br />There, OK, well I've gone through all the remainder books, but I still need to know if he wants this. I'll just wander through the rest of the store. Hmm still no more Butler. I bought their only Butler book months ago and they've never gotten more. That's sad.g<br /><br />I wonder how the hell they do the PPT chapter of Goon Squad on audio. That...that would be awkward if she describes the slides. <br /><br />Let's see what's over in the new releases section. Oh hey look, Warm Bodies. I want to read this. But no, I shouldn't get it. I already have enough to read. But I am sort of in a zombie mood, since I'm listening to World War Z<br /><br />:text from BF+: \"OK\"<br /><br />OK? OK, get it? OK, that was a good enough description? OK, I'll start reading your blog?<br /><br />:text to BF+: \"I get it for you? You could always read a story before opening the audio. You don't like and I'll return\"<br /><br />Alright, I'll go back and grab that. And, I mean, since I'm going to the register anyway I may as well get  Warm Bodies.<br /><br />Because apparently it was just the journey to the register keeping me from buying it? Wouldn't want to go up there with just one thing. That would be ridiculous. Maybe I'll just get the audiobook<br /><br />Guy at the register: Just these two things then?<br />Me: Yup!<br /><br />Yeah, so I'm getting both of them.

I guess I should actually see what of hers I don't have and then see if they can get it but really, I want them to have more Butler so other people will read her.

The final Deathly Hallows post. I am out of tears. I've used them all up. Rowling, you have given me hours of entertainment and I Love the whole series, but right now, I hate you. This post is going to be a mess. Just an absolute train wreck. It's just going to be a lot of sobbing and yelling and pictures of hot Neville to help offset all of the sobbing. You've been warned.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/06/harry-potter-readalong-deathly-hallows.html\">Alice, you kick ass for hosting this readalong</a> and there will be spoilers. And tears.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" />I'm so glad we've started this section with Neville being Neville and hugging people and so happy to see H/R/Hr. And we find out he's been raising hell at Hogwarts and is regularly getting tortured, but he's still so up beat, because he is the best, and I love him.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/awkhotneville.jpg\" /><br />\"'Thank you, Pomona,' said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a grim look of understanding.\" And this is my new couple to ship, now that a Sirius/Lupin love would be awkward, given that Sirius is dead and all. Oh right, and Lupin is married with a kid. But it's mostly the dead thing.<br /><br />Speaking of Lupin being married and all, we do not get nearly enough Tonks in the series. We get the slightest hints about her. She's so happy and cheerful when we first meet her. Then we have her anguish between being at Hogwarts to fight or staying at her mother's with her son. How the hell could she make that choice? Both of them suck. I addition to the whole Maurauder's prequel, I'd also like to request the events of the current story but told from the other characters' POVs.<br /><br />DAMMIT, ROWLING, I TOLD YOU DON'T MAKE ME CRY ON THE TRAIN. Why did you have to kill Fred? Were there just too many Weasley's about? We could spare a few? I HATE YOU RIGHT NOW.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jesscrying.gif\" /><br /><blockquote>\"That's right Harry...come on, think of something happy....\"<br />\"Something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked.<br />\"We're all still here,\" [Luna] whispered, \"we're still fighting. Come on, now....\"</blockquote>Luna and Neville constantly make me tear up because they are both so brave and so amazing and UGH, they are the best. I fully agree that Luna could have talked Voldie out of his genocidal plans and into a career as a rare artifacts curator or something equally benign.<br /><br />Harry is going to the Shrieking Shack to kill Nagini and Voldie is waiting for him, and then we find out Snape is there and that is it. That's the point that I quit listening to the book during my commute. I'm sorry, I can't be sobbing on the train, even if it would likely creep someone out enough that I'd get to sit down.<br /><br />We see the dead lying in the Great Hall and I lose it, especially when we see both Tonks AND Lupin are dead and THAT'S NOT FAIR, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/too+much.gif\" /><br />And then I cried all of the tears I had left while reading The Prince's Tale. Thanks for the dehydration, Rowling.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/nobodylovesme.gif\" /><br />(Remember when we thought Snape was all super badass for being able to curse George's ear off, enough so that everyone thought he was still evil, but not enough to mortally injure the boy? Yeah, turns out Snape actually has lousy aim and George is just lucky he didn't get hit dead on.)<br /><br />So I drank some water to, you know, re-hydrate, and Rowling ruined it all again when Harry pulls out the resurrection stone and asks his parents and Sirius and Lupin if it hurts to die and I CAN'T EVEN<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/braincrying.gif\" /><br />Voldemort comes back to the castle with an apparently dead Harry and what does Neville do? He charges at him. He charges at him and yells his allegiance to Dumbledore's Army in the Dark Lord's face. Then immediately after being tortured by having his head lit on fire, he kills Nagini. Holy shit, Neville is the biggest badass.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/hotneville.jpg\" /> pocket watch &amp; everything. What to say about everything that happens after this? Apparently Harry did have all 3 Hallows for a little while, though someone else is going to have to explain the whole wand switching thing cos I missed it (I think diagrams will need to be involved). Then Harry beats Voldemort because OF COURSE he does, it would have been a lousy series if he didn't. Then we get the epilogue and just, I guess it was nice to see everyone happy, but I'm so sorry Albus Severus. I'm sure you can change your name when you get older. Maybe your mom will even get a say in what to call you this time around.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bigbangpapers.gif\" /><br />So until next week when we have our final Harry Potter readalong wrap-up post, wherein we'll gush about how this was the best readalong ever (because Siriusly), how sad we are that it's over, and I'll share all of the GIFs I collected specifically for this but didn't get a chance to use.<br /><br />Side note, I decided to Google \"death count for Harry Potter\" to see what the totals are for the series and when I type in \"death count\" Google said \"Oh do you mean WWII? 9/11? Some other actual tragedy?\" and then I felt bad. STOP JUDGING ME, GOOGLE.<br /><br />Title quote from page 722<br /><br />Rowling, J.K. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Sometimes there will be lots of thoughts and the review is pretty much written by the time I'm done. Other times there's just a line or 2. For True Grit, here's the only note I took:<br /><br />I want to be clear, this is no indication of how good the book is, or how much I liked it. Just that this was apparently the only thing I felt the need to write down, because it was so important I didn't want to forget it. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/True+Grit+covers.jpg\" />I don't know what it is that made me pick up True Grit. I'm not really a fan of Westerns. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/it-is-hard-to-find-friend-i-said-it-is\">The Sisters Brothers</a> is the only one I can think of having read. I wasn't a fan of the movie. I wasn't not a fan of the movie. I haven't seen the movie, is what I'm trying to say. It was on sale, but there were loads of books on sale and I can't say what made me pick up this one and leave another one behind. But I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This is a simple storyg about Mattie Ross avenging her father's death by hiring US Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Mattie is fourteen and...I'm not really sure what other word to use here. The whole time I was reading it I tried to come up with something. Spitfire? Kind of but she's more reserved. Solemn? She's certainly very serious, but she's not dour. She knows what needs to be done and she is single minded in making sure Tom Chaney is brought to justice. Or killed. Western justice.<br /><br />Mattie is one hundred times more mature than I am even now. Or probably will ever be. She's so young, she's just lost her father, but she never waivers from her goal. She goes to Fort Smith to settle her father's affairs and retrieve the body. Wait, let me say that one more time. She goes to retrieve her father's body. I would be a wreck and she's so, not fine with it, but it has to be done and so she does it. And she doesn't just do it, but she does it so well. She haggles and threatens to bring in lawyers to sell back the ponies her father bought, but now that the family no longer needs. She finds out Cogburn as \"grit\" and she makes it her mission to not only hire him, but to go along. She doesn't always get her way. She did everything she could to keep Texas Ranger LaBoeuf from joining in the hunt for Chaney, but ultimately he joins them, though she makes it clear she wants Chaney tried for her father's murder and not the bounty Chaney is hunting him for.<br /><br />I love Mattie. She's wonderful and very funny, though she doesn't really intend to be. She's just so adorable when \"the biggest story [she] ever told!\" is that she's not tired when actually she is quite sleepy. And of course there's that cat quote I felt the need to make note of:<br /><blockquote>I had hated these ponies for the part they played in my father's death but now I realized the notion was fanciful, that it was wrong to charge blame to these pretty beasts who knew neither good nor evil but only innocence. I say that of these ponies. I have known some horses and a good many more pigs who I believe harbored evil intent in their hearts. I will go further  and say all cats are wicked, though often useful.</blockquote>She's so sincere and earnest and naive. One more example of how she's a great narrator? Oh well, if you insist<br /><blockquote>He passed over the check. \"Is this any good to me?\"<br /> It was a cashier's check for $2,750 drawn on the Grangers Trust Co. of Topeka, Kansas, to a man named Marshall Purvis. I said, \"This is a cashier's check of $2,750 drawn on the Grangers Trust Co. of Topeka, Kansas, to a man named Marhall Purvis\"</blockquote>Love her.<br /><br />That's not to say the other characters aren't also great. Cogburn is curmudgeonly and a drunk and has seen better days, but under it all has a real sense of loyalty and honor. LaBoeuf is a lot of bluster and a lot of personality, but like Cogburn, he comes through in a crisis. Chaney and his gang of criminals (or really Lucky Ned Pepper's gang) are just as fun to watch, for the opposite reasons. They have no honor, but they aren't really evil.<br /><br />And there's suspense! They're hunting down this murderer so of course there's suspense. It's not constant which is nice cos you need a breather but it's done so well.  Even if you don't typically read Westerns, just read this one. I have no idea if it's anything like \"typical Westerns\" but this is just so good.<br /><br />I haven't seen any of the movies, so I have no idea how they compare. Anyone seen them? Are they good?<br /><br />Simple, but not easy. It's an important distinction.<br /><br />Title quote from page 195<br /><br />Portis, Charles. True Grit. Overlook Press, 2010.

You guys, we're almost done with this readalong and I'm not ready for this to end. What will I do for my Friday posts??<br /><br />Thanks <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/06/harry-potter-readalong-but-this-is.html\">Alice for hosting this potteralong</a> and beware for there are spoilers.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />I didn't write down any notes for this section. I kept thinking \"Oh that's a good point. I should write it down so I don't forget.\" And then I proceeded to do whatever it was I decided was more important than following through with writing shit down.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/catflump.gif\" /> Mostly this <br />So, let's see what I can do.<br /><br />How bad did you feel for Xenophilius? I did not correctly remember this chapter at all. For whatever reason I was thinking Xeno tried to turn Harry over for selfish reasons that had nothing to do with the fact that his daughter had been kidnapped and was probably being tortured RIGHT NOW. I'm not saying I forgive him for calling the Death Eaters. I'm just saying he was between a rock and a hard place, and I don't know what I would have done.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jack_sad.gif\" /><br /><br />I'm very happy Hermione let the DEs see Harry and therefore the odds that they'd kill Xeno are slightly less? I hope. I'm just generally happy Hermione is there for everything because seriously, Harry and Ron would be so lost without her.<br /><br />Greyback making vague rape threats towards Hermione: DO NOT LIKE. Obviously I'm not supposed to like it, but maybe we could stick with just the Cruciatus curse?<br /><br />The Taboo curse on Voldie's name is actually really clever. Good job, Death Eaters.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/slowclap.gif\" /><br />I don't know what it was, but I didn't cry during Dobby's death. I remember bawling the first time around. Maybe because I knew it was coming. Maybe because I was on the subway. But it didn't hit me like I thought it would. I didn't tear up until Dean and Ron jumped down to help Harry dig Dobby's grave. And then it sort of subsided until Luna spoke. Luna and Neville can always make me cry.<br /><br />So, that blind and abused dragon guarding the Lestrange vault. There's no wizarding version of ASPCA, huh? They need some Sarah McLachlan guilt commercials.<br /><br />I like Aberforth, that goat lover. I don't like that he's given up and is ready to give in to Voldemort's reign, but he helps out H/R/Hr. And he gives us more insight into Dumbledore's past. As with everything, it's not quite the rainbows and unicorns version that Elphias Doge told, and we all knew it wasn't like Skeeter's horrible rendition, but instead it falls somewhere in between. I enjoy these shades of gray.<br /><br />NEVILLE IS BACK! And he is roaring with delight. Neville, you're the best. And thank you for ending this section on a (relatively) happy note.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/nickdance.gif\" /><br />Also this, because I'll never tire of looking at hot Neville<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Nevillehot.jpg\" /><br />Until next week.

I downloaded it as part of my I'm-going-abroad-and-need-to-make-sure-I-don't-run-out-of-books frenzy. I thought maybe it was overkill and then finished my other books and started this on the flight back. So it all worked out for me. Actually getting around to reviewing the book has been less successful. Because I am lazy. I'm also not quite sure what to say.<br /><br />Do I describe the plot? I did a bit with the first book but that was different. If you're starting the series, you should know what you're getting into. By the second book, you know what's up. A bunch of characters are all vying for the crown and I kept thinking of the song Why Can't We Be Friends because I think it would have solved a lot of problems. Or at least made a funny soundtrack to all the fighting.<br /><br />This book was all battles. And battles. Then there was another battle. Then when you're like \"Wow, there have been a lot of battles so I guess we should probably have something else...oh another battle. So. That's neat.\" At one point I realized I wasn't quite skimming the battle scenes but I found myself hoping the fighting would hurry up so I could get on with the story. Then I realized that the fighting was the story and I was going to need read the next book to (hopefully) hear something different.<br /><br />I also realized far too late that the book has an appendix in the back that explains who all the characters are and what their connections to each other are. The whole time I'm reading I kept thinking \"I need to be taking detailed notes about who the hell all these people are\". I blame the Kindle and the fact that I can't just flip through the pages and notice that OH HEY, there's exactly what I need just stuck in the back. So dammit me. I'm sure I will forget when I get around to the next book. I still wish there had been a little \"Last time on...\" before the chapters because sometimes you go hundreds of pages in between one character's POV chapter and it would take me awhile to realize where we left them.<br /><br />But there were things I liked about the book:<br />Arya's story is just getting more and more interesting and she rules.<br />Sansa no longer makes me eye-roll myself to a headache and her story is actually pretty tragic.<br />Tyrion continues to kick ass and it was a good thing he kept talking about his sister or brother or father because I kept forgetting he was part of the Lannister family. Because see, they suck and he rules.<br />Catelyn continues to be strong and tries to hold things together. Plus she pairs up with Brienne who is a fearsome knight AND a lady, so love that<br />Dani still has her dragons. I like dragons<br /><br />OK so, I didn't really realize this until now, but despite the fact that I question how much GRR knows about lady-bits, he does have some interesting, fleshed out female characters. It almost makes up for lines like this: \"Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest.\" This line is from one of Dani's chapters. As in from her point of view. If I may paraphrase a Cracked listg obviously ladies are constantly thinking about what their boobs are doing..well, all the time. It's sort of two steps forward, one step back, but at least we're still moving forward with female character development.<br /><br />I enjoy the series. I do. I mean, it would suck if I didn't considering I've read something like 1,700 pages of it so far and I'm only two books in. But this book didn't exactly get me excited to continue on. Whatever the hell happened on the most recent GoT episode that got Twitter and Facebook all hot and bothered makes me want to hurry up and read book three so I can figure out WTF just happened.<br /><br />So, overall, the book is meh. If this had been the first book, I probably wouldn't continue on. But I shall continue on. Not right away. Perhaps the next time I'm sitting at an airport and I realize that I better download another behemoth so I won't run out while I'm travelling.<br /><br />You know, as I do. <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_19785_5-ways-modern-men-are-trained-to-hate-women.html\">5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained To Hate Women</a><br /><br />Title quote from page 37, location 857<br /><br />Martin, George R.

But I didn't do that. I blame the long weekend for throwing me off. That and the new Arrested Development season, which I've spent my time watching instead of doing...well anything productive these last few days.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/macandcheesefriends.gif\" /><br />I also meant to take part in Armchair BEA, but I forgot to sign up or write anything. See my excuses above. But I want to post something because I've been really slack with posting recently, for no real reason other than I'm easily distracted and writing posts takes focus.<br /><br />But I wanted to post something today and I liked <a href=\"http://kfmurphy.blogspot.com/2013/05/armchair-bea-day-2-blogger-development.html\">Kayleigh aka Nylon Admiral's</a> post regarding her blogger development and decided to hop on that topic as well. I'd say copy her, which is what I'm doing, but since she's answering the prompt from the Armchair BEA topic that's not really the case. I was thinking that a reflection post like this may be better saved for a blog anniversary. Then I remembered that my blog birthday was May 8th and, as usual, I totally missed it. Whoops.<br /><br />I began blogging a few years ago at the urging of Boyfriend+ (then just plain ol' Boyfriend), because I complained to him about not making use of my English degree too many times. When I started writing I didn't really do book reviews. I sort of did but I would post every couple days and talk about whatever point I was up to in the book. Think of it as like readalong posts but with just me. So yeah.<br /><br />I still like those posts, but I stopped doing them because I would finish a book before I wrote anything, so I would end up just writing a single post about that book. I've since stuck to this single post per book (you know, like every other book blog) because I still read faster than I write. And I've found that the readalong style posts are more fun if you're part of a group. <br /><br />I also used to do more of the memes when I was first starting out. I still think they're a great way to find to find a blogging community when you're first starting out. I sporadically do the Tuesday Top Ten meme/hop if I like the topic, though now my goals are less to find new bloggers. I still go through the TTT entries other people post, but I'm less likely to comment and follow people like I did when first starting out. As such, my follower growth has slowed over the last year plus. Which is fine because one of the first lessons I learned about blogging was to ignore your reach numbers. Unless you're trying to build a brand and make blogging your primary form of income, stressing about those numbers will just make your head hurt. Besides having lots of followers but no engagement isn't much fun. I prefer a smaller group that I regularly \"talk\" to.<br /><br />I sometimes will accept a free book in exchange for a review, but I try to be selective about what I'll accept. I've been burned by books I would have happily DNF-ed if I didn't agree to a review. For the most part I'd rather just read whatever I feel like and write about that. I love that with blogging I learn about so many books that would have flown under my radar if it wasn't for fellow bloggers raving about them. Before blogging I re-read books a lot. I still do this, but less than I used to because now I have lists and piles of books I want to read.<br /><br />So that's where this blog has been. Where it's going, well, who knows. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I mean, there are so many books still to read, still to talk about.<br /><br />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:05+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:05+00:00","published_at":"2013-05-29T18:40:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e055dde2223b60000b9","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"blog anniversary","slug":"blog-anniversary","url":"/articles/tags/blog-anniversary"},{"value":"blogging reflections","slug":"blogging-reflections","url":"/articles/tags/blogging-reflections"}]}]},{"id":"53224e055dde22fdcf0004a9","title":"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death","slug":"the-last-enemy-that-shall-be-destroyed-is-death","url":"/articles/the-last-enemy-that-shall-be-destroyed-is-death","body":"Another Friday and we are making our way through part two of Deathly Hallows. Shit is getting real (realer), thank you <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/05/harry-potter-readalong-deathly-hallows_24.html\">Alice for hosting this thang</a>, and beware, thar be spoilers.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />Here's the thing I've found about this section: I don't remember a thing from my first read through. Which means I have a lot less random thoughts that make up the other book posts, because with those I already knew the plot so I could focus on the important stuff like wizarding plumbing and how bad at math Rowling is. This time though I realize the only thing I remember about this book is who dies (only out of the important characters) and the epilogue. Now I'm spending my reading/listening wonder what the hell is going to happen next.<br /><br />I feel like this post is going to be Defend the Marauders-ishg. But whatever, here goes. Lupin is an asshole for wanting to go along with H/R/Hr and leave a pregnant Tonks with her family. He has reasons which aren't entirely selfish, but he's still a jerk for considering. That said, this isn't unforgivable especially because he doesn't go with H/R/Hr. Just as one good deed doesn't make up for a lifetime of being a shithead, and one asshole decision doesn't destroy a lifetime of being a kind and trustworthy person.<br /><br />It's so nice to see Kreacher happy. Happy-ish. Obviously this is in large part to the fact that H/R/Hr are nice to him, but I think another equally large reason is he was able to tell the story of what happened to Regulus. Figure he's been carrying that around with him for years, but because Regulus said he couldn't tell any of the family he was never able to unburden himself. Hermione has always been nice to him, but it wasn't until he was able to tell what happened to Regulus and he got a little piece of his missing master that he quick being such an asshole. It doesn't mean Sirius &amp; co were right to be jerks to him before, but I don't know that being super nice would have made quite that much of a difference.<br /><br />The Ministry chapters were SO STRESSFUL.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dinokitchen.gif\" />Not only do you have H/R/Hr having to polyjuice to try to steal the locket from Umbridge (who would never have it in the first place if MUNDUNGUS WASN'T SUCH A THIEVING ASSHOLE. Sorry, this section has me shouty. Because of the stress) but then they accidentally polyjuiced someone whose wife is being tried for being Muggleborn. The whole courtroom scene was terrible. It was terrible to know this was happening at all and terrible to know that H/R/Hr made it slightly worse for Mrs. Cattermole, since her husband wasn't there for her. Because they made him throw up so much it's a wonder he didn't die. Yes, they saved them in the end and that is what's important, but still. You realize not only how dangerous things are for them, but even without meaning to how they're putting other people in danger.<br /><br />I like Phineas Nigellus (I think of him as Phinny. I assume he'd hate that. You know, if he were not fictional and all), ever since he told off Harry for being a pain in the ass when he was being a pain in the ass back in book five. I kinda like that they have him around, even if it's at least 50% arguing with him. Sure, maybe he's only showing up to talk to them and try to figure out where they are so he can tell Snape and Voldie can get them, but given his relationship with Dumbles I don't think so. And after all  he is giving them information about the goings on at Hogwarts. I don't understand why H/R/Hr (OK, let's be honest, just Hr cos you can't trust the others to come up with anything) don't have him ask questions and pass information to portrait Dumbles.<br /><br />I had to re-listen to the Nagini attack at Godric's twice before I fully realized what was going on. How did I forget that whole scene? I thought Bathilda would have things to reveal about Dumble's and maybe even Harry's parent's pasts. That...that did not go as expected.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/trustfallfail.gif\" /><br />Could people please stop listening to Rita Skeeter after she's proven time and again that she writes just ridiculous and outright lies? I'm not even talking about people that haven't been directly attacked by Rita, but Harry, perhaps you have some insight into how much truth her writing contains.<br /><br />A few thoughts about when Ron comes back, because that's the part I just finished listening to, and thus is fresh on my mind:<br />1. If Ron's reintroduction hadn't involved immediately saving Harry's life, you think we'd all be so happy to see him again? Cos I was super happy to see him again, but I feel like if he'd just shown up again my reaction would be been more Hermione-esque. Just seemed a bit manipulative, but of course JK is not above manipulating be via Ron. Remember <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/dumbledores-man-through-and-through\">Ron's poisoning</a> last book.<br />2. When Ron's supposed to be destroying the horcrux and is instead standing there just listening to fake Harry and fake Hermione say mean things to him, how much did you want to strangle Ron? I couldn't help picture Harry sitting down in the snow going 'Oh for fuck's sake, if you're going to just stand there give me the damn sword.\" Maybe it's just the audiobook but this seemed to take forever.<br />3. How was Ron able to find Harry &amp; Hermione? The Deluminator because magic. Shut up.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/harryreads.gif\" /><br />See you back here again in 2 weeks (BEA!) for more Deathly Hallows.

Not that I really have an excuse for this. Well, my excuse for not writing this review earlier this week was I was going to, and then instead decided to watch Mad Men and eat pie. Priorities, people.<br /><br />I read Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella during <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/i-am-back-you-stop-holding-your-breath\">my trip to Ireland/London</a> because 1) vacations call for light and fluffy reads, 2) this takes place in London and I WAS GOING TO BE THERE, and 3) people that I trust for book recommendations said \"I know this is a fluffy book about shopping and stuff, but it's better than it seems, and please ignore that movie they made.\" And thus did I read this light, fluffy, \"chick lit\" book about shopping. People were right, it was better than I would have assumed.<br /><br />It's about finance writer Becky Bloomwood who is pretty much the last person you'd think you should be taking financial advice from. She is thousands of pounds in debt and just keeps on spending. She tries to only buy the necessities but that includes things like \"that scarf she really really wants\" or \"shoes that are really an investment\" and other such rationalization that keeps her in debt. She ignores warning letters from her credit cards and dodges phone calls from her bank, but at least she's a positive person.<br /><br />Of course as seems to be a pre-req for \"chick lit\" it's a romantic comedy and thus there is a love story involving super rich big shot Luke Brandon of Brandon Communications. It's not that I don't like love stories, but this plot line I was very \"meh\" about. It plays out exactly as you know it's going to play out.<br /><br />Becky is a very likable character, which is good because she's also shallow and kinda ditsy. I rooted for her, even when I wanted to strangle her because OMG get your financial shit together, lady. You do not need that scarf that is HOW MUCH? I never got less frustrated with her (just really irresponsible) financial decisions, but as you start to get to know her more you feel bad for her instead of angry. And you see how easy it is to feed this cycle of debt.<br /><br />It was the quotes that pulled me in, so I think it's best to share a few of the ones I highlighted (hooray Kindle)<br /><br /><blockquote>The FT is by far the best accessory a girl can have. Its major advantages are:<br />1. It's a nice color<br />2. It only costs eight-five pence<br />3. If you walk into a room with it tucked under your arm, people take you seriously. With an FT under your arm, you can talk about the most frivolous things in the world, and instead of thinking you're an airhead, people think you're a heavyweight intellectual who has broader interests, too.</blockquote><blockquote>Even better, although no one can see them, I know that underneath I'm wearing my gorgeous new matching knickers and bra with embroidered yellow rosebuds. They're the best bit of my entire outfit. In fact, I almost wish I could be run over so that the world would see them.</blockquote><blockquote>I'm as excited as a little kid on Christmas Day (or as me on Christmas Day, to be perfectly honest). </blockquote>See, she's adorable.<br /><br />This is not a book that will make you think deep thoughts. You can probably guess the entire plot and every turn once you've read the first couple pages. Or even the summary on the back. It's unlikely I will pick up the rest of the Shopaholic series. But if you want something that is light and fluffy \"chick lit,\" something to read while on a beach, this is an excellent choice.<br /><br />Title quote from page 10, location 159<br /><br />Kinsella, Sophie.

The last Harry Potter book. I probably remember this book the least other than there are a lot of sads to be had. Thanks <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/05/harry-potter-readalong-deathly-hallows.html\">Alice aka Reading Rambo</a> for hosting this readalong beware of spoilers.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />First thing. Ways Harry Potter is infiltrating my real life or how this readalong is affecting me: I was at Penn Station waiting for an NJ Transit train staring at this rotating iron works sculpture dealy they have in the waiting area. It's sort of a strange piece. There's a flying boat with beauty queens and a giant Mr. Peanut holding a tiny elephant. But that's not the part I focused on.g There's also a flying devil running on the same track as the boat, carrying a little man. I was trying to figure out why this would be part of the sculpture till I remembered the Jersey Devil is a thing, although I've never seen it portrayed like this one. Normally (because OF COURSE I have books on the subject) the Jersey Devil is described as hooved, head of a goat, with giant bat wings. Now, it's also described as walking on 2 legs, but I ignored this and thought to my self \"Well, clearly the Jersey Devil is some offshoot species of thestral.\" Then I realized that I'm talking about fictional creatures and went back to staring at the board willing my track to show up already.<br /><br />I took no notes while reading/listening this time around. Let's see if this makes the post any more or less coherent. Judging by my tangent above, I'm thinking less.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/ronawk.gif\" /><br />How bittersweet is it to see Harry unpacking his truck and getting ready for his journey? I mean, hooray because he gets to leave the Dursleys and never come back. But then leaving anywhere is sort of sad. And then of course we have Albus's obituary, in case you forgot that his death was sad. AND THEN Dudley tells  Harry that he doesn't think he's a waste of space. There could be hope for the boy yet. Of course if you were worried about things getting too sweet, then Vernon is there to continue being an asshat because some people don't change.<br /><br />Then we have the Seven Potters and it's SO INTENSE. First Hedwig is killed and you want to be sad but there isn't enough time because EVERYTHING IS STILL HAPPENING. You don't have time to catch your breath before Voldemort shows up and of course he can fly without a broomstick, because picturing him having to ride a broomstick is hilarious.<br /><br />Then, to keep the tension up, Harry and Hagrid make it to the Burrow fine, but we have to wait and see if everyone else makes it back. And of course they all don't because JK hates us and wants us to suffer. Was that not clear when she killed of Sirius and Dumbles? Frorge loses an ear and Mad Eye is gone and shit. We keep losing people that know what they're doing.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/killwhatyoulove.gif\" /><br />Ron's comments about the book Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches: \"You'd be surprised, it's not all about wandwork, either.\" I expect everyone to have mentioned this line in their own posts. Not all about wandwork indeed.<br /><br />Hey look, everyone figured out how to send messages using their Patronuses. (Patroni?) You know how else you can send message to people quickly and without owls? Phones. Just sayin', wizards.<br /><br />The ministry has fallen and Scrimgeour is dead and everything gets SUPER INTENSE again. The wedding is broken up by a Death Eater attack and H/R/Hr flee to London. Of course Hermione is prepared for this and has their bags all packed already. Because she took Mad Eye's lesson of constant vigilance to heart.<br /><br />Kreacher's story is touching and makes you feel bad for the poor house elf. I mean, he's still an asshole and still hates Mudbloods, but what a sad story. And of course we get the explanation of who RAB is (Regulus, which I'm pretty sure everyone guessed) and how he managed to switch the locket. You know that Kreacher loved Regulus, but you also see how much Regulus really cared for Kreacher. He could have made Kreacher drink the potion in the basin a second time so he could put the locket in there, but he didn't.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/needamoment.gif\" /><br />Again, I don't remember much about this book other than lots and lots of tears. I am afraid of what is coming. Rowling, please be nice.<br /><br />Well, not completely but I mean, how can you ignore giant Mr. Peanut &amp; a tiny elephant on a boat full of Miss America's? Exactly, you can't. Which is why it's mentioned here even though it has nothing to do with the point I'm making.<br /><br />Title quote from page 40<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

Not only that, I haven't even heard of the majority of these. I will need to add some more books to my TBR list. Cos you, know, that wasn't long enough yet. Now the next category<br /><br /><u>Great Memoirs</u><br />37. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/only-in-comedy-by-way-does-obedient\">Bossypants by Tina Fey</a><br />38. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/if-you-have-any-doubt-which-will-dent\">Kitchen</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/reading-on-subway-how-i-pretend\">Confidential</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/its-nice-sometimes-to-know-how-low-you\">by Anthony Bourdain</a><br />39.

Though I've read Kitchen Confidential so many times I should get to count it at least twice.<br /><br /><u>Poetry</u><br />(I didn't leave out the Great. The list did.)<br />50. The Complete Poems of Anne Sexton by Anne Sexton (well, I've read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/boy-has-found-gold-keyand-he-is-looking\">Transformations</a> a few times, but not all her stuff)<br />51.

Letters to a Young Contrarian by Christopher Hitchens<br />64. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards<br />65. He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt &amp; Liz Tuccillo (I started reading this one and thought it was terrible and DNF-ed it. Which was sad cos I like the little bit of Behrendt's stand up I've seen.)<br /><br />None in the general life how-tos, though really I should probably get some more guidance there.<br /><br />Out of the 65 on the list, I've read 10. I thought i would have read more. I did not expect to not even recognize so many. As I said above, I'm not to worried about not having read all (or even half) of the books on the list. I certainly won't be reading all of these before I'm out of my twenties, consider I have less than a year to do that.<br /><br />How'd you do with the list? Do you recognize more than me? And I realize I didn't tell you which ones I don't know. But just figure if I didn't read it and it's not an obvious one everyone knows, I probably didn't recognize it. Way to make me feel like a loser, Buzzfeed.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:06+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:06+00:00","published_at":"2013-05-16T13:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e065dde2223b60000bd","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"I love lists","slug":"i-love-lists","url":"/articles/tags/i-love-lists"}]}]},{"id":"53224e065dde2223b60000be","title":"Walking a marathon is much, much, much harder than running one.

But for whatever reason I was being stubborn about reading Moranthology. Which is stupid. I don't have a good reason other than everyone (well <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/03/i-am-just-going-to-be-polite-and-silly.html\">Alice aka Reading Rambo</a> and <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2012/11/devouring-books-moranthology-by-caitlin.html\">Laura aka Devouring Texts</a>) told me to and apparently my reaction to being told I should read a book that I will love is \"SHUT UP, don't tell me what to do!\" Before I went on <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/fear-not-for-i-shall-return-shortly\">my trip</a> I realized I was going to need some books so I may as well download this one. I mean, I was going to be in London and Moran is over there and would be referencing English things. PLUS this is a collection of essays meaning they are short and you can feel very accomplished as you speed through them.<br /><br />I sort of loved this book. More than How To Be A Woman? Maybe. I haven't entirely decided. And to be honest, it's hard to compare the two since HTBAW had a theme running through it and Moranthology does not. Believe me, I mean this as a compliment. Her essays are all over the place in a wonderful way. There are serious essays (\"I Know What It's Like To Be Poor. They Took Away the TV and We Cried\"), ridiculous essays (\"I Am a Dwarf Called \"Scottbaio\"), essays about celebrities (\"Come Party with Gaga\"), feminist essays (\"Burqas: Are the Men Doing It?\"), relationship essays (\"Call Me Puffin\"), essays review TV shows I have not watched but really want to based on Moran's descriptions (\"Downton Abbey Review 2: 'SEX WILL BE HAD! SEX WILL BE HAD!'\"). Just look at those essay titles, and try to tell me you don't want to read every one of them.<br /><br />The only problem with this set of essays (and the fact that I read this on a Kindle) is it was over so quick, and without warning. It's not like with a story where you can tell you're coming to the end. The essays could have gone on and on and I would have been happy to keep going with them.<br /><br />I have a hard time whenever I'm writing a review of a book I liked. So, as is my normal solution in times like this, here are a bunch of quotes to help convince you that you should just read this:<br /><blockquote>In many ways, this book might as well be called \"Deduce THIS, Sexlock Holmes!\" with a picture of me licking his meerschaum, cross-eyed and screaming. </blockquote><blockquote>The last time I felt so embarrassed about the visible contents of my handbag was last spring, when I was carrying around a gigantic book on the history of the Ku Klux Klan. For two long months, that book made me want to shout, \"I'm reading this because I know they were bad -- not to get tips!\" to any halfway full train.</blockquote><blockquote> Parents drinking is the reason you came into the world, and if we didn't keep doing it, then by God, it would be the reason you went back out of it.</blockquote>Even this semi-review took me awhile to write because while looking for quotes to include I wanted to just start reading it again. And it's so easy to do. \"Oh I'll just read one or two essays\" and then suddenly half the book is done. If she'd like to come out with a follow up to this that is just MORE of her essays printed elsewhere, that'd be cool. I'd be all for that.<br /><br />Title quote from page 49, location 859<br /><br />Moran, Caitlin. Moranthology.

This time though, we're taking a break from the normal Harry Potter series and reading The Tales of Beedle the Bardg. Which meant I had to go find a copy and the children's section of the bookstore is harder to navigate than I would have originally thought. Eventually I stumbled on the (giant, really obvious) shelf of all things Harry Potter, found a copy, and was on my way just before the bookstore closed. Because I do things last minute like that. I'm a little bummed it's hardback but I GUESS it's fine.<br /><br />I guess there are spoilers in here, except it's for wizarding fairy tales, so yeah, you're fine. <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/05/harry-potter-readalong-tales-of-beedle.html\">Thank you Alice</a> for hosting this Potteralong.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />I always have such a problem writing about collections of stories and I have been staring at the page for awhile trying to figure out what to write about. Do I write about each story? Just a couple? My overall thoughts? I really have no idea. and this isn't like the series where I have a billion thoughts and I sort of just takes notes as I go. But this book 100 pages with thick margins and big font and pictures, and I didn't have many notes to take. So let's see how this goes<br /><br />So, wizarding fairy tales you say.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/goon.gif\" /><br />I know Rowling mentions in the intro that the difference in these stories, unlike Muggle ones, is that magic is sometimes used for good. Which doesn't really seem right. I mean, consider Sleeping Beauty. Magic is what causes to her fall asleep for 100 years after pricking her finger on a spindle, but magic is also what keeps her alive, instead of dying when she pricks her finger. I suppose I point this out only to say that without changing things, I could see them showing up in any collection of fairy tales, Muggle or not.<br /><br />\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" is the best of the stories, which makes sense. I'm sure it's the one she put the most time into, given its importance in the last book. Maybe it's just because it's the last story but it's the one that felt the most natural. That felt most like a real fairy tale. And, I mean, it's the one Dumbles likes the most so OBVIOUSLY it's the best one.<br /><br />I was also a fan of \"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\". I was going to say maybe there's something about sets of three, but then I forgot the Fountain includes that Knight. Even though he's just sort of there and doesn't really do much other than be nice and follow the witches around. Witches that also don't really do all that much. Except for Amata, who actually figured out what needed done when the water asked for treasures from the past. Otherwise the other witches just happened to cry and sweat in the appropriate place. And the knight actually tried something at each step. So I guess he's slightly more than just there. He tries, even if ultimately he can't get past any of the obstacles. I especially like Dumbles' notes at the end, especially the note about Lucius and how awful he's always been.<br /><br />Dumbles' notes at the end of \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" are the best part of this story, and I appreciate the explanation of wizard/Muggle relations. Or lack thereof. Plus it has the Umbridge-esque version by that Mrs. Bloxam lady.<br /><br />I did not expect the ending to \"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\". I thought it would end with happiness and the warlock realizing the importance of love. I did not expect murder via heart stealing. The idea of the heart growing hair and turning into a beast I get, but I couldn't help but think of it as a moldy heart. That sort of took the edge off.<br /><br />Now that I've written about all of the other stories, I may as well write about \"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\" even though overall I was sort of \"meh\" about it. I do like the that Babbitty tricked the King into not being such a douche AND she got them to erect a gold statue of her.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/beyoncehairflip.gif\" /> Hollywood version of Babbitty <br />Every time I write the title I have to correct myself. I keep wanting to call it Tales of the Beedle Bard. I'm picturing a giant insect spinning yarns.<br /><br />Not long after writing that, my computer got a virus that I had to deal with. So. Yeah. That's how things went. Sorry if this post is short, but a lot of my writing time was spent cursing at my computer.<br /><br />Title quote from page VII<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

Especially when you consider about half of my reads fall into the light and fun category. I was going to say something about these being great books for great weather, but I'll read these books whenever I feel like I need...well, something light and fun. When the weather is nice, when the weather is crappy, when I need a break from what I'm currently reading, when I'm in a reading slump, when I'm reading a lot. You know, whenever. So here we go<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/toptentuesday.jpg\" /><br />1. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">Let's Pretend This Never Happened by Jenny Lawson</a> - I love this book. I've read it a couple times now and it still cracks me up. It's a great to pick up sporadically. There's no real story so it doesn't matter if you put the book down for a couple months and then pick it up right where you left off. I'm sort of making my way through it and when I get to the end I just start over.<br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-think-you-showed-lot-of-heart-lot-of\">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged by the Reduced Shakespeare Company</a> - I can't tell you how many times I've read this play. All the times, if I had to venture a guess. I pretty much know it by heart but that's OK because it's great and I heart it. Nerdy Shakespeare jokes for the win.<br /><br />3. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">The </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">Thursday</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/thats-realworld-for-you-brutal-and\">Next </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/thats-realworld-for-you-brutal-and\">series by Jasper Fforde</a> - The whole series counts as a single light and fun read, but seriously, it's so good. It's fun and it's quirky and it has Bookworld. How can you have a Bookworld and have it NOT be fun?<br /><br />4. Notes from a Big Country by Bill Bryson - As I mentioned in the Lawson entry, I like books that I can pick up and put down without worrying about losing my place. This is a collection of columns Bryson wrote for The Mail on Sundays about what it was like to move back to the States after living in England for so long and it's so Bryson-y. He curmugeons about things, and is in awe of the wonders of the world, almost in equal parts.<br /><br />5. Moranthology by Caitlin Moran - This is a new addition to my collection of light and fun reads (and I'll have that review written any day now. You know, after I finish procrastinating by writing posts like this.) Like the Bryson book, it's a collection of her columns from Times about things like how Ghostbusters is the best movie ever.<br /><br />6. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/only-in-comedy-by-way-does-obedient\">Bossypants by Tina Fey</a> - And while we're on the topic of hilarious ladies, Fey's memoir is the best. It's hilarious and she has lots of stories about being a woman comedy writer and a mother, sometimes even at the same time.<br /><br />7. High Fidelity by Nick Hornby - Who knew that a book about the male psyche would be one of my favorite books? Well actually, considering how many \"middle class white guy problems\" books I've read, perhaps it's not that surprising. But still, isn't that in itself surprising? Anyway, listening to Rob &amp; company take music way to seriously is lots of fun, even when he's making bad decision after bad decision. Bonus, since I'm also a fan of the movie, I always picture Jack Black as Barry.<br /><br />8. Freakonomics by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt - I've recently been listening to the Freakonomics podcast so this book is on my mind. Want to examine how incentives affect just everything? Want to compare how the KKK is like real-estate agents or if names really matter.<br /><br />9. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/i-wanted-grand-ferocious-larger-than\">Who Are You People? by Shari Caudron</a> - Why yes, I would like to read a book about a journalist who decides she needs to get to the bottom of people's obsessions, including ice fishing, Barbie enthusiasts, and Josh Groban fans. The book is funny without being condescending to the people she's writing about and she's only sort of creeped out by the furries. So there you go.<br /><br />10. Calvin &amp; Hobbes by Bill Watterson - Any collection. 10th Anniversary that includes notes from Watterson? Definitely. The Complete Calvin &amp; Hobbes? As long as you have a comfortable couch to sit on, absolutely. There's never a bad time for Calvin &amp; Hobbes.<br /><br />What are some great light &amp; fun reads that I've missed?<br /><br />Update: I need to include one more because HOLY HELL how did I forget <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/he-said-he-preferred-armageddon-to-sams\">Attachments by Rainbow Rowell</a>? I'm disappointed in me, and I also blame ebooks, since having it on my Kindle means I can't just glance at my shelves for inspiration. But seriously, this book is so good and cute and funny and every time it's mentioned I want to read it again. It's such a feel good book.

This sucks. Google Reader makes it so easy to manage all the blogs I follow, keep things organized, and I can access it wherever. But they're buttheads so I'm going to have to come up with a new solution. The two that have come up the most are Bloglovin' and Feedly. So I signed up for both of them to try them out because why not. They both let me import my current blogs into their systems. It's only been a couple days, but let's see how, so far, things look<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/rss-battle.jpg\" /><br />Bloglovin'<br />The Good: <br /><ul><li>Easy to import my blogs into the system</li><li>It's browser based, which means I don't need to download anything to use it</li></ul>The Bad: <br /><ul><li>The items don't get marked as read until I actually click on a button to mark it as read.</li><li>Animated GIFs are not animated unless I go to the actual post</li><li>Can't resort items so the oldest posts appear first </li><li>If I read a blog in a different reader, which I often do since I use Newsify App, it doesn't register those posts as having been read</li><li>The browser tab doesn't tell me when unread posts are pulled in. This is a minor thing, but I usually have a tab with GR open along with a zillion others and I like to be able to just glance at it to see if anything new has come in.</li></ul>Feedly<br />The Good:<br /><ul><li>Easy to import my blogs into the system</li><li>Animated GIFs are animated within it</li><li>Scrolling past items marks them as read</li><li>Easy to re-sort posts</li></ul>The Bad:<br /><ul><li>The browser tab doesn't tell me when unread posts are pulled in.</li><li>If there is a post made up of images, they're formatted right to left. Which is neat and all but since I don't read that way, it's very annoying</li><li>You have to download a browser extension. I regularly use 3 different computers, which means I need to download on all of them (and 4 dif browsers in total). This is annoying and means that if I'm away from any of these computers I can't use Feedly</li></ul>So there you have it, at least so far. If I'm wrong on any of these points, let me know. The fact that I can't get Feedly just wherever really annoys me, even if it doesn't pose a problem that often. I also thought I would have no problem setting up the extra security on my Google accounts until that <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/there-would-normally-be-quote-here-but\">bit me in the ass</a>.<br /><br />I'm not too worried about the mobile app for either of this systems, if only because I currently use Newsify and like that better than the Reader mobile app.<br /><br />I also read a <a href=\"http://www.gottabemobile.com/2013/04/28/google-buys-wavii-may-play-role-in-google-reader-replacement/\">couple</a> <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/is-the-next-google-reader-replacement-the-recently-acquired-wavii-0480703\">things</a> about Google buying Wavii and that possibly being a GR replacement, except it looks like the focus isn't going to be something I care too much about. I'm generally distrustful of natural language processing stuff ever since a vendor told me their system was better at determining sentiment than real humans, at which point I laughed, mumbled something about a robot uprising, and then added sarcastic notes to my presentation. Cos I'm a mature adult. ANYWAY, Wavii's focus seems to be automated curation which is nifty and all but not really what I'm looking for.<br /><br />So for now I'm continuing to rely on Google Reader while I sporadically play with Bloglovin' and Feedly, end up disappointed in both and just whine WHY MUST GOOGLE DESTROY THE THINGS I LOVE? (See \"mature adult\" comment above.) Do I like Google Reader so much because it's what I'm used to? Yes, most definitely. Does that mean I'll accept its demise with quiet dignity and just learn to use a different reader? Not a chance.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:08+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:08+00:00","published_at":"2013-05-06T13:25:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e085dde223867000249","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"RSS reader","slug":"rss-reader","url":"/articles/tags/rss-reader"}]}]},{"id":"53224e095dde22fdcf0004ad","title":"Dumbledore's man through and through","slug":"dumbledores-man-through-and-through","url":"/articles/dumbledores-man-through-and-through","body":"Happy Harry Potter Friday!

I bet he'll come up with something really clever and...oh he'll just get him drunk and use his parents' death to guilt him into it. Right. Well. There you go.<br /><br />Oh look, Harry and Ginny are officially going out. And again...<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/emmashrug.gif\" />It still feels forced. Harry's crush on Cho didn't feel forced. It was adorable. This just feels like \"Oh we're almost at the end of the series and Harry doesn't have a love interest, so let's fix that.\" But Ginny continues to kick ass, so I'm cool with seeing more of her.<br /><br />Most of this book is its own story. However, from the time Harry gets the final summons from Dumbledore to the end of the book is pretty much Deathly Hallows: The Prologue. The other books obviously lead into each other, but they were all stand alone books. This one doesn't wrap up. It doesn't even end with Harry back at the Dursleys. It ends with H/R/Hr still at Hogwarts, planning to start their fetch quest that is the next book. I like the raising of the stakes and whatnot, but I sorta wish this had more of the wrap up the other books had.<br /><br />We do learn the answer to a question I was very curious about back when we read Chamber of Secrets. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/it-is-our-choices-harry-that-show-what\">What was Lucius hoping to accomplish</a> by sneaking Tom Riddle's diary into Ginny's bag and did he know what it actually was? Dumbles tells us that no, he didn't know it was part of Voldie's soul, which is why he was so careless with it. However, he did know it would open the Chamber and was totally cool with murdering a bunch of children in order to get a wizard fired. Really, the fact that Malfoy had so much trouble murdering Dumbles is pretty admirable considering he was raised by someone who is pretty blase about killing. Of course maybe this is just because Malfoy had to come face to face with his victim while Lucius would have been pretty far removed, but still.<br /><br />So Dumbledore is dead. Was I sad about this? Of course because I am human and have a soul. Was I as sad as I was with Sirius's death? Nope. Dumbles death for me:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/rain.gif\" /> Less this <br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/saddoc.gif\" />I'm still not sure why this is. Maybe because there's so much downtime to really let Sirius's death sink in, and that's when the sads really got to me. Dumbledore's death is surrounded by so much craziness and fighting that there isn't time to catch your breath and really wallow in the grief. I was less in shock this time around cos, you know, I knew it was coming. That said, Dumbles had all the answers and you knew things were ultimately going to be OK while he was around. Now he's not and now things are unknown and shit. I'm sure Dumbles is still Dumbling where ever he is.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dumblin.gif\" /><br />Before this readalong, I didn't realize I was all for defending Fleur. To be honest, the only thing I really remembered about her in this book is she's bratty and says stuck up things, but then all is forgiven because she'll still marry Bill even though he's not as handsome anymore. But this time around I feel so bad for her. Does she still say bratty and stuck up things when she's at the Weasley's? Yup. Though given she's just learning English, I do give her some leeway because English is hard and she may not mean things to come out quite the way they do. Hermione and Ginny are talking about her behind her back and calling her names, which isn't that much better than calling her things to her face, and also doesn't mean she doesn't know about it. The Burrow isn't the biggest house and it wouldn't be too surprising if she had overheard them. We see that Mrs. Weasley didn't even make her a holiday sweater after making them for EVERYONE ELSE. So the ladies of HP, who I normally luuurve are acting really catty and this did not make me happy. Fleur's understandably hurt when Mrs. Weasley suggests Fleur won't want to marry Bill after his attack. She makes it clear that she knows, and has known, Mrs. Weasley doesn't want her to marry Bill. But she does it without insulting Mrs. Weasley, without pointing out how mean they've all been to her. Fleur's proud (she does push Mrs. Weasley out of the way, after all), but she's not cruel. She's far from my favorite character, but there's more to her than I thought the first time around. Go J.K. for putting so much into this minor character.<br /><br />I can't believe we're almost done with this readalong. Next up The Tales of Beedle the Bard which I haven't actually read before so EXCITEMENT.

I can't quite remember when I started, but then again I usually can't remember what I had for dinner the night before so I mean, not unusual. I followed him for a long time before reading Blackbirds and I don't know exactly why I took so long.<br /><br />Miriam Black can see death. One skin-on-skin touch and she knows when, where and how a person is going to bite it. So she's seen a lot of deaths, both gruesome and mundane, but she's never been a part of it before. That is until her name is the last thing on a dying man's lips. A man that didn't know her until she hitchhiked into his truck. What does she have to do with his death? Can fate be changed?<br /><br />Miriam is a great character. She's cynical, foul-mouthed, and crass. Is she damaged? Sure. Did I mention she sees how people die? All the time. And she's found that whenever she tries to save someone she makes things worse. So yeah, if she wasn't damaged that would probably make her a sociopath. The book has enough of those, I'm glad the main character has feelings hidden underneath her tough exterior.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful and violent and gritty and dark and twisted and violent. Oh did I mention violent? It's not gratuitous  it's what makes the story. And it's not to the extent of American Psycho as in, this one didn't make me feel physically ill. And the suspense. There were a bunch of those nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat moments, which can be dangerous to listen to on the train if you want to make your stop.<br /><br />If you're familiar with his blog and Twitter (and if you aren't, you should fix that) then you already have an idea of his tone, his style. This isn't to say Blackbirds is anything like his blog. That was actually something I needed to get over at first. I knew this was a work of fiction, but it doesn't have his humor that is so prevalent on his other sites. That's not to say this book doesn't have humor in it. You need something to cut the violence (it has pleeeenty of that) but it's not the same laugh-out-loud stuff I was expecting. That said, the laugh-out-loud stuff would have seemed out of place. It took me a little while to stop looking for the humor, but once I accepted the story for what it was I was much happier.<br /><br />Side note, do you see the cover for this book? It's AMAZING, isn't it?<br /><br />Title quote from location 86<br /><br />Wendig, Chuck. Blackbirds. Angry Robot, 2012.

And this time I'm back stateside so you'll get my normal incoherent ramblings. LUCKY YOU!<br /><br />Thanks <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/04/harry-potter-readalong-half-blood_25.html\">Alice for hosting this super-fun, gif-filled readalong</a> and beware, there are spoilers ahead.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" />First thing, and I meant to say this in my last Half-Blood Prince post, but I forgot cos traveling. But anyway, for reasons my copy of HBP is the \"adult version\". As I've explained a couple times my HP collection is all weird and messed up, because I don't have a matching set so it was necessary that it doesn't match in a VERY SPECIFIC WAY. Since my second book was some weird mass-market paperback bought in Rome I needed the 6th book to also be a mass-market version. This is apparently really hard to find until I stumbled on a listing for the \"adult version\". Luckily, this just referred to the cover not being cartoony, and I didn't end up with some weird porn version of HBP. It's really just for adults who are self conscious about being seen reading a kid's book. Except HP is one of the most well-known book series out there, so these anxious adults are not fooling anyone.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/HP+HBP+cover.jpg\" /><br />Now, random incoherent thoughts!<br /><br />Snape insulting Tonks's new Patronus -<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/whatthefuck.gif\" /> Tell 'em, Snape. Wait, what? See, anytime I start to think maybe Snape is kind of OK, and I cut him some slack for being sort of a jerk because of all he's been through, he does something like this and I hate him ten fold. It was bad enough him making fun of Hermione's teeth in front of the class. Now he's taunting Tonks about her depression, and his reference to her new Patronus means he KNOWS what's bugging her so much. Or at least thinks he knows, and either way, taunting her for this makes him a really terrible person<br />gDouble spoiler, since this is about stuff that hasn't happened just yet<br />So either he thinks the Patronus change is because she's sad her cousin was just murdered and Snape, are you seriously mourning the murder of a family member, even one you hated??? Or else he knows it's because of her feelings towards Remus and the danger he is in and again ARE YOU KIDDING ME???<br />Extra spoiler stuff contained here. Normal spoiler stuff still below<br /><br />Does Dumbles know Parsletongue? When he and Harry venture into Ogden's memory a lot of what they hear is a conversation among the family spoken in Parsletongue, which I thought only Harry could understand. Did Harry break things down for Dumbles afterwards? Does Dumbles speak snake? Are memories subtitled? And building off that last one, if Ogden didn't speak Parsletongue and this is his memory, how they hell did he remember the hissing noises so exactly that Harry could understand it? I have lots of questions about the whole Pensieve concept. Apparently to the point that I'm missing all of the important information being told to us. <br /><br />I was irrationally angry at Mundungus for stealing things from Grimmauld place. Then I laughed when Phinny got all offended when he found out. Not that a portrait can do much but maybe he'll make some really scathing remarks at the guy or something. I feel like that's what he'd do even if he were corporeal.<br /><br />Dumbles was a red head. Did we know that already? Regardless, I'm happy to see so many of my people wandering around these books.<br /><br />How creepy is the scene with the cursed necklace and Katie Bell? Poor Katie. Maybe this is why you don't accept packages from strangers.<br /><br />So now we're getting the start of the Ginny/Harry pairing and...well...<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dontcare.gif\" />I don't remember having any particular feelings about this the first time around. Now I picture Rowling going \"I should really give Harry a love interest that doesn't spend a bunch of their time together crying. But who to choose? Oh, Ginny's been hanging out over there being awesome, so that works.\" I mean, it makes sense and I could see Harry falling for his BFFs little sis who helped him fight at the ministry. But the whole thing just feels like an afterthought. Not like the Hermione/Ron pairing which was CLEAR from the start. Those two are adorably bicker-y.<br /><br />However, before we can really get to Hermione &amp; Ron, we have to watch Ron &amp; Lavender. Poor Hermione, although she should really quit being so mad at him. Except I don't know I can blame her too much, if only because Won-Won and Lavender are especially annoying. Also \"snogging\" is an excellent term that we need to adopt over here.<br /><br />I feel so bad for Lupin in these scenes. I forgot what he was up to the whole time in this book. And I can picture him trying to talk the werewolves into joining Dumbledore. I'm sure things are going as well as they did when he was trying to keep James and Sirius in line when they were all at Hogwarts. Lupin needs a hug. And maybe someone to buy him some new robes for Christmas.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/polarbearhug.gif\" />I came veeeeery close to liking Scrimgeour during the Christmas scene, until he made it clear he wasn't just trying to make Percy see his family (which makes no sense because why would he care if Percy is fighting with his family except that I just want everyone to be happy, dammit.) But it's especially pathetic that Umbridge is still working for the Ministry. She went clearly nuts in the end and there were plenty of people to act as an anti-character witness for her. How the hell does she still have any job, let alone with the Ministry?<br /><br />So love potions are wizarding roofies, yes?<br /><br />The Apparition instructor's name is Wilkie. That is all.<br /><br />What was Slughorn hiding in his memory??? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO RON??

It reads like someone just recorded every fever dream they had and then put them together in a book. Whether or not that sounds like something you'd like to read is up to you.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not a fan of listening to other people's dreams, in the real world or in books. Maybe it's because I have trouble following them, or because they aren't nearly as interesting to the listener as they were to the dreamer.g I think it's the following thing mostly the \"I can't follow them\" thing because there is no logic to them. Things just happen and then suddenly something else happens and then a third thing happens that is unrelated to the first two things, the end.<br /><br />As I said, the book is a collection of short stories, which is always difficult for me to review. Normally I review a couple of the stories. But these stories sort of blend together.(by being a series of non-sequiturs, not because they all reference each other) so I'll try to take this collection on as a whole.<br /><br />The stories actually started out normal enough. Well as normal as a story about a boy raised by a talking racist monkey and an Italian organ grinder stereotype after his drunk and abusive Klingon loving father spontaneously combusted, leaving him an orphan. Yes, that's the part of the story I could follow. You tell me that this is the story, fine, I can get behind it. Maybe set up a few rules so I can follow this twisted world, but I can get behind this. But there are no rules and there is no reason and suddenly a guy having an awkward dinner with his racist grandfather when General Tso appears out of no where and murders the old man. And that's it. Story over. There's no rules and no explanation and I spent a lot of this book dealing with literary whiplash as I tried to catch up. Eventually I realized there was nothing to catch up to. I was there, I just had no idea where \"there\" was.<br /><br />After finishing the series I read a couple people refer to the stories as \"slapstick\" and similar to a Punch and Judy play. I an see that. At least from what I know of Punch and Judy, which isn't much. There's a lot of violence but it's so ridiculous it's nothing you can take seriously. That doesn't mean I'm enjoying it, just that it isn't disturbing violence. It's like watching The Three Stooges. If you find them funny, this might be the thing for you. Maybe. I know as much about the Stooges as I do about P&amp;J so, yeah.<br /><br />For example, there are lines like this, which happen during a strange dinner party with a couple doctors and patients:<br />\"Doctor Milano noticed three men bouncing around the room, hooting like Daffy Duck, until Doctor Rossi hit one on the head with a frying pan and shot the other two with a tranquilizer gun.\"<br /><br />So yeah, if you like slapstick violence, crazy non-sequiturs, and a general feeling that you're listening to the rambling fever dreams of someone tripping, this could be a book for you! Unfortunately, it was not the bok for me.<br /><br />Please read the Cracked list <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-things-you-love-to-discuss-that-nobody-else-cares-about/\">5 Things You Love to Discuss That Nobody Else Cares About</a> to see I'm not alone in this. <br /><br />Title quote from page 9<br /><br />Frissore, Michael.

And also to be back with Boyfriend+ who will need to come with me next time so we can do London together instead of just comparing notes.<br /><br />Note: All pictures below were actually taken by my aunt because I forgot to bring my nice camera with me. I did take pictures because my awesome friend lent me her camera. And then I forgot to dropbox myself those pictures so she's going to do it for me but she hasn't yet (probably because I haven't pointed out to her that I didn't do this myself, oops). I am so good at capturing memories...<br /><br />First, I flew into Dublin. This should have been fairly straightforward, but nothing can ever go exactly as you planned, can it? My aunt and I were making this trip together. She lives in VA, so she was going to connect through JFK and she and I would meet at the airport and then continue on to Ireland. Except the flight to NY was delayed and delayed (and eventually cancelled) due to weather in my area. What kind of weather? Well, from what I could see beautiful skies and little wind. Jerks. But anyway, she missed her flight. I tried to see if I could change my flight and just fly out with her the next day, but that would have cost me about twice the cost of the original ticket, so that wasn't going to happen. So I went out Weds night by my lonesome.<br /><br />When I got to Dublin it was raining so I went straight to the hotel and was VERY happy they had a room available for me so I could check in right away. I was planning on dropping my bags off and going into Dublin but all I wanted at this point was to shower and take a nap. And besides, I've been to Dublin a few times. Had the weather been nice I would have gone in and just wandered around. Instead I decided sleep is awesome so I mostly hung out around the hotel (not in city center) and rested. It was touch-and-go that night if my aunt was going to be able to make her second flight, because now Atlanta was having weather problems and WHAT THE HELL? I went to bed not entirely sure if she'd make it in the morning, but luckily she did. She got to the hotel pretty much in time to check out, but at least she got free breakfast and a shower before she and I wandered around Dublin.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0004.jpg\" />We didn't have too much time in the city because we were due to take a bus up to Belfast to meet up with my friendg who is living up there. As I said, I've done the city before so I was fine with just wandering the streets and my aunt is flexible so it was nice to be able to just walk around and not have a schedule or plan to stick to.<br /><br />The next day my friend took us up along the coast road to go to the Giant's Causeway. My aunt is a geologist so she was super excited. I don't understand science or rocks enough to fully appreciate it like she did, but I did like it up there. And luckily the weather held out just long enough so the rain started right after we left. OH and we did this CRAZY rope bridge thing and I thought the wind was going to knock me to my death so that was fun. Fun cos you know, it didn't.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0017.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0023.jpg\" /> We then headed back to city center to meet up with my cousin who had flown into Dublin from Paris that morning and was taking the train up to us. She's been living in France for the past year, and visiting her was a big part of this trip. Why didn't we visit her in France if that's where she's living? An excellent question. So anyway, she gets up to Belfast and then we spend the night relaxing and drinking wine and I freak out a little as I realize I've essentially <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/there-would-normally-be-quote-here-but\">locked myself out of all of my Google accounts</a>. Go me.<br /><br />The next day we head into St. George's Market and we had planned on taking a Political Taxi tour, where they explain to you all of the stuff going on in Belfast that makes it a bit shooty up there. Except none of the tour companies were answering their phones, so my friend ended up driving us around, taking us the the Peace Wall and she is an excellent tour guide. Also she could have made up everything she told us and I'd never know.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0033.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0032.jpg\" />My aunt, cousin, and I then had to catch a bus back down to Dublin because we were flying out to London the next morning. London was great and I loved it there, probably because it reminds me a lot of NYC, but with a Globe theater. And OF COURSE we did a tour of it. That was one of the first things we did when we got there. We also walked around a lot, did a hop on/hop off tour of the city, a river tour thing, visited many pubs, and did some shopping. 3 days was not enough time and I'm ready to go back please!<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0057.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0061.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0066.jpg\" /><br /><br />This is where we began to part ways. My cousin was staying in London to meet up with friends before heading to Berlin. My aunt and I flew back to Dublin together but she stayed in the city so she could fly back home the next day while my friend picked me up at the airport, and she and I made our way over to Galway.<br /><br />I did no sightseeing in Galway. My friend's family is from the area and I've been out there a bunch of times before to visit with her and her family. I love the stuff out there and everything is beautiful but we wanted some time to just hang out. So we spent some time in Galway city center, went to a spa (my birthday gift!), went out for a pub crawl so we could hit up all of the bars we used to go to, and then just hung out around the house. It wasn't enough time but then again it never is.<br /><br />The last day was a looooooong day. I woke up at 4am GMT so we could drive the 30 min into Galway city center so I could catch a 2 and 1/2 hour bus ride over to Dublin so I could catch a 7 hour plane ride back to NYC. Boyfriend+ greeted me at the airport with mac and cheese (which beats the hell out of flowers) and I came home for a 20 min power nap before heading back into the city for dinner and a movie. It's the Tribeca Film Festival and before leaving for vacation I said OF COURSE I'll be fine to go to a movie the night I get back. Because I don't understand jet lag or the fact that at 9:30 movie is roughly 2:30am in the timezone my body is in. But I got mofongo for dinner, the movie (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2421416/\">Trust Me</a>) was good and included a Q&amp;A with the cast and almost made it worth it that we didn't get home until roughly 2:30am ET, at which point I crashed. And now I'm hear trying to make it through my Google Reader and ignoring my work email until tomorrow when I don't have a choice but to confront that inbox.<br /><br />Also I have a BUNCH of reviews I really need to get to. Here's what I will eventually get around to writing.

This is going to be another quick post as I\u2019m still out of the country. I\u2019m actually sitting in a bar in Galway typing this up right now. Or at least starting this post. Anyhooo<br /><br />Thanks <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.ie/2013/04/harry-potter-readalong-half-blood.html\">Alice for hosting this</a> and thar be spoilers ahead.<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img dua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /></a><br />So, I didn\u2019t finish the reading this week. Or in my case, the listening. I think had I actually had the book itself instead of just the audio I may have finished it. I can listen to the audiobooks if I\u2019m on the move, on a train or a plane or something. This week though I\u2019ve had a lot less travel time, which means a lot less time to just sit and listen to the story. I\u2019m doing well this week.<a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/balloon.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img dua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/balloon.gif\" /></a><br />Also I\u2019m still angry at JK at this point cos of the whole ending to <em>OotP</em>. Which is roughly how I remember the reading going the first time around. How was it for those that had to wait for the 6th book to come out? I read 3-7 straight through so I didn\u2019t have any time in between to speculate about what would be happening or really come to terms with the (SUPER AMBIGUOUS I STILL DON\u2019T BELIEVE IT) death of Sirius. Of course that does mean even this time around I get all choked up whenever Harry gets choked up about Sirius\u2019s death and then everyone\u2019s sad again. <br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/rain.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img dua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/rain.gif\" /></a><br />But at least this time Dumbles has realized maybe keeping Harry in the dark is a bad idea and has started letting him in on details. Plus this means more scenes with Dumbles and I love the way he had the glasses of brandy? whiskey? whatever smacking the Dursleys in the head when he was hanging out there waiting for Harry to get packed.<br />Then they go try to talk Slug-man into coming out of retirement. I did like his disguise and also the fact that he's just breaking into random Muggles homes to hang out there, which is creepy. And he says pompous things about all the amazing people he has inspired, but it's nice to see a Slytherin that isn't awful to the core. <br /><br />Back to the Burrow and we learn that Arthur's private nickname is Mollywobbles (or that's what it sounded like) and that's adorable. <br /><br />Oh and Fleur's hanging out, saying awful things even though it doesn't sound like she means to and maybe the others should be a little nicer to her or maybe tell her to shut up a bit. Tell her to shut up nicely and maybe call her a berk a few times. Family relations, I will fix them. <br /><br />Aaaand, that's as far as I've made it. Whoops. But I'll be all caught up for next week. Probable promises. Also I will be able to actually visit everyone else's blogs. I will dedicate Sunday to that.

And I missed it, but let me briefly explain. See one, <a href=\"http://whatredread.blogspot.co.uk/\">I am currently in Ireland</a> (more specifically at the moment I'm in Northern Ireland, in Belfast) so that already was going to get in the way of this being a normal HP post. Second, I am SO SMART and decided to turn on that 2 step verification on my Google accounts. For those of you that don't know it, it means the first time you log in on a new machine, Google sends a verification code to your phone. You type that code in and you're good to go. You know, assuming you're not currently out of the country with a non-working cell phone. If you are well then SOL for you, isn't it? I had Boyfriend+ get into my account on one of the computers at home I've set as safe and disable that so I can be here. YOU SEE WHAT I DO FOR YOU GUYS. Also for me. <br /><br />Anyway, onto the post, yes? (<a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/harry-potter-readalong-order-of-phoenix_12.html\">Thank you Alice for hosting</a> and watch out for spoilers)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img bua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /></a>So normally I write down notes as I'm reading, and then I just sorta post that (hence the messy posts I've been putting out). This time I don't have any notes so this might be more coherent but will inevitably leave a whole bunch of stuff out. <br /><br />There's a reason I've never made it past this book when re-reading the series. It's this stupid ending. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/hurtlikemf.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img bua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/hurtlikemf.gif\" /></a>The whole time I was reading, remembering how great it was I knew this ending was just waiting, mocking me. It's like that Sesame Street book <em>The Monster at the End of the Book</em>, only instead of getting to the end and finding an adorable Grover, you find the death of Sirius and things are all sad and horrible, the end. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jesscrying.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img bua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/jesscrying.gif\" /></a>Oh but it's not the end cos then we watch Harry deal with the death and guilt and it's horrible again. DAMMIT JK, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US?<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/everythingsucks.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img bua=\"true\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/everythingsucks.gif\" /></a><br />I didn't quite cry during these scenes. I was first on a plane, then a bus, so I tried to hold it together. I don't remember if I did the first time I read it either because it comes as such as surprise and then you're just in denial that he's gone because  JK decided to write the most ambiguous death scene ever. Which meant I pretty much spent the rest of the series until the end convinced he was going to come back. Did I mention I'm excellent at denial? <br /><br />I should mention some of awesome scenes, because there are awesome scenes. (Even if I wanted to SCREAM at Harry the whole time he's insisting on going to the Ministry and If you had just bothered to practice Occulmency LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE then maybe this wouldn't have happened. Oh look, I'm back to the bad parts. Dammit.) Neville, and Luna, and Ginny kick so much ass at the Ministry. They're so badass and so willing to help Harry and put themselves in danger. They rule. They just throw themselves into this thing full force. Even Luna who hasn't known Harry for years and Harry &amp; co aren't even particularly nice to her. Yet she's still there in the thick of things because she's great. <br /><br />I would say more but I am apparently holding up things. It seems some people want to use their time in a new country to go sight seeing or something like that.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:11+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:11+00:00","published_at":"2013-04-13T08:17:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e0b5dde2223b60000c5","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"JK Rowling","slug":"jk-rowling","url":"/articles/tags/jk-rowling"},{"value":"Harry Potter readalong","slug":"harry-potter-readalong","url":"/articles/tags/harry-potter-readalong"},{"value":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","slug":"harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix","url":"/articles/tags/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix"}]}]},{"id":"53224e0c5dde22386700024e","title":"Fear not!

Well I'm heading east, but Boyfriend+ is not. So, would-be-robbers, he will most likely notice if you sneak in and start moving things around. Maybe don't do that.<br /><br />For those taking part of the Harry Potter readalong, WORRY NOT! There will still be posts, as I will be hanging out with my friend while I'm overseas and I've already told her of my internet needs. My posts may just be late and my commenting may be slim. I apologize in advance.<br /><br />Now to the important part of this post, what books will I be taking with me on this journey? I have a couple long flights ahead of me, plus relaxing time. So I want to make sure I'm covered. Here's what I've got:<br /><br />Finishing up Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br />Starting Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<br />Both of the HP books will be audiobooks because an iPod travels better than large paperbacks<br /><br />And now for my other books, all on my Kindle cos this is the best part of eBooks. Easy for packing<br />Moranthology by Caitlin Moran which I started this morning, because it was on sale and I finished Blackbirds<br /><br />Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella which is not my normal choice, but it was also on sale, and a bunch of trusted people have recommended it. Plus light reading is in the theme of this trip<br /><br />A Clash of Kings by George R. R. Martin which is the next book in the Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones seriesg. I bought the last one before a trip so it seems like the thing to do. Plus it's roughly a billion pages long, so I shouldn't run out of book.<br /><br />I'm probably being overly optimistic about how many books I'll get through. But whatever, we shall see<br /><br />And so farewell people. I will be back soon with pictures of important Irish pubs and London landmarks. If I remember to take pictures.<br /><br />See you all soon!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/imout.gif\" /><br />If he wanted the series to be known as Song of Ice and Fire then he should have gotten them to name the TV show that.

We're now up to part 3 of Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix and SO MUCH IS HAPPENING. First up<br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/04/harry-potter-readalong-order-of-phoenix.html\">Thank you Alice</a> for hosting this readalong<br />2. Thar be spoilers, so be prepared<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />Remember last week's post that was incoherent and an overall mess? Get ready for another one! But there are a BILLION things going on in this section so it can't be helped.<br /><br />Hagrid's lesson on thestrals is very cool, except for the fact that the majority of the class can't actually see them. Perhaps more of the lesson should have been something the other students could have enjoyed. Or maybe he could have provided pictures or something<br /><br />Uh oh, Sirius has been drinking alone. This can't be good. Is Lupin staying with him? He needs a roommate that is not Kreacher. I mean look how insanely happy he is when everyone gets to hang out for Christmas. Also was there any reason that even if Arthur hadn't been attacked that Harry couldn't have hung out there for the holidays?<br /><br />Also his argument with the twins about why they can't go to St. Mungos was accurate if insensitive. The twins retort that he's not doing anything but staying safe at home was cruel but understandable. Thank you Rowling for giving us lots of grey area in good people being mean. It's a nice comparison to the constant awfulness of the Slytherins.<br /><br />\"'Doctors?' said Ron, looking startled. 'Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, they're healers.'\"<br />Hey wizarding folks, maybe lay off of how awful you think Muggle doctors are, with their primitive healing methods. I guess you guys have all the normal diseases sorted out, so you just have to worry about magical maladies. Oh and way to share your secrets with the Muggle community. But I know, you guys don't want to be bothered by having the Muggles ask you for help all the time. Way better they just deal with shit like cancer on their own. This readalong is really making me think that, as a whole, wizards are jerks.<br /><br />Ginny and Phineas yelling at Harry for getting all angsty again:<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/slowclap.gif\" />Phineas may be a jerk but he's right that maybe Harry should trust Dumbles, even if Dumbles won't let him in on every detail. And YES GINNY for reminding Harry that, oh yeah, Voldie actually possessed her too, so maybe quit playing the \"No one knows what this is like\" card.<br /><blockquote>\"I didn't want anyone to talk to me,\" said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled. <br /><br />\"Well, that was a bit stupid of you,\" said Ginny, \"seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.\" <br /><br />Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he turned on the spot to face her.<br /><br />\"I forgot,\" he said. <br /><br />\"Lucky you,\" said Ginny coolly.  </blockquote> Scene with Neville at St. Mungos I HATE YOU. Quit making me tear up on the subway.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/rainingonmyface.gif\" />And MAN did I want Harry to just deck Ron during the whole thing.<br /><br />Remember last week when we're all like \"Hey wait, why does Hermione have a hard time saying 'Voldemort' given she's Muggle-born and all?\" Well she apparently heard us and is completely over her sudden problem saying Voldie's name. Not only that, but she's getting all angry at other people who don't like saying it.<br /><br />Harry's date with Cho is adorable, even if he ruins it by being a dumb boy. I remembered Cho being all lame and moody and weepy for no reason, but this time around I'm totally on her side. Sorry Harry, you are clueless and you clearly need Hermione there to lead you through basic human interactions. Except for her comment that Harry should have told Cho he thought Hermione was ugly. That was a stupid comment that plays into the \"All girls are catty and hate each other\" thing. Reassuring Cho that he actually wants to be on his date with her and NOT escape immediately to his friends is good. Insulting his friend to play into Hermione's assumed insecurities of Cho is bad.<br /><br />So Lee Jordan got the same punishment that Harry did. Why isn't he telling anyone about this? I (sorta) get why Harry won't tell anyone, but Lee doesn't have any reason not to share. And if she's using her crazy quill on Lee and Harry, there's no reason to believe she's not doing this to other students as well. How are no teachers noticing this?<br /><br />Ron, listen, you're going to need to stop suspecting Snape. I understand, he makes that as difficult as possible but you have been proven wrong over and over again. Maybe you just back off this theory.<br /><br />That clever name for the DA club doesn't seem so clever now, does it? Except Dumbles seemed fine with it. Even when he's hexing people and fleeing from the law, he still Twinkles.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/dumblin.gif\" /><br />I really wish the students would get over the whole \"points for our house\" thing. You'd think at some point, like when Malfoy &amp; co became part of the Inquisitorial Squad, that these things would stop mattering. Or maybe keep pretending you care around Malfoy so he just uses that to punish you. But given house points ultimately determine the decor for the final feast, maybe don't get so bent out of shape about them.<br /><br />Harry seeing Snape's memory in the Pensieve: This is a pretty depressing scene. You see James and Sirius being assholes to Snape, who sucks but wasn't being a dick to them at the time and didn't deserve what James did to him. However, given that these are Snape's memories, I don't entirely trust them. Not saying that what happened to him didn't happen.Were the Marauders assholes as teenagers? Probably. Most teens are. Were they the super assholes Snape remembers them as? Maybe but since we're seeing this through a Snape filter, watching Snape's memory, probably not. This is probably why I can still heart Sirius despite this scene. Even Sirius admits they were \"arrogant little berks\"g and \"a lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen.\"<br /><br />Related! That scene where Harry is talking to the remaining Marauders about their teenage behavior, I kept thinking about Megs comment on <a href=\"http://sarahsaysread.com/2013/03/22/harry-potter-readalong-harry-and-his-teen-rage/\">Sarah's post</a> about Lupin and Sirius being the cutest couple. I may love Sirius but this is the couple I'm shipping. Even though I know how things turn out.<br />More Related! <a href=\"https://jennysbooks.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/revisiting-harry-potter-defending-sirius-part-2/\">Jenny (once again) wrote an excellent defense of Sirius</a> which you should read but she also points out that Lupin can't afford gifts and odds are the books from him and Sirius were probably bought by Sirius who just added Lupin's name to the tag.

First up, why do I have to be fictional to have crushes on these characters? No I'm sorry, the fact that these people are fictional does not stop real life me from having my crushes. So let's change this to \"Top Ten characters I totally have crushes on even though they are fictional and I don't know why you keep bringing that up like it makes a difference.\" In no particular order, let's do this<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/toptentuesday.jpg\" /><br />1. Sirius Black from The Harry Potter series by JK Rowling - I'm taking part in the Harry Potter ALL THE GIFS readalong so Sirius is on the brain and I LOVE HIM. You can try to keep pointing out his faults like it will change my mind or something (Alice) but sorry, nope. Love him. Even when he's all angry and pouty about being stuck at Grimmauld Place he's stick pretty great. And yes he has his faults (wreckless and rash and proud) but I can't hear them over his awesomeness.<br /><br />2. Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - OK, so I feel like this is an obvious one and will probably show up on everyone's list but don't care! I enjoy the fact that he sucks at declarations of love (Against my better judgement and the fact that your family is SO LAME, I still like you? You like me? Please check yes or no) and is witty little remarks.<br /><br />3. Lincoln from Attachments by Rainbow Rowell - What a super sweet nerd. Sure he's not the most outgoing, considering he spends most of the book reading the emails between Beth and Jennifer instead of actually talking to them. But it's cute and not stalkery, I swear.<br /><br />And because I can't think up enough guys, here are some of my major literary lady crushes<br /><br />4. Marian from The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins - Marian is the best. The best. She's so smart and you need a mystery solved? Marian's got this, all while deflecting criticism (ladies can do things?) by pretending she's just meek and mild. AND she's part ninja/part velociraptor. Well, not in a literal sense. That would have made a whole different book. But her spirit animal would be a ninja velociraptor.<br /><br />5. Thursday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde - Thursday kicks ass. She investigates literary crimes oh and also spends half her time living in Book World sorting out mysteries there. She's smart and can fight if she needs to but most of the time she can think herself out of whatever crazy situation she's gotten into. She and Marian together would be a force.<br /><br />Aaaaand that's all I got. I really thought I'd do a better job with this and apparently not. I'm probably missing some big names, and thus will have to amend this after I see other people's lists.<br /><br />Here are some people I thought of AFTER publishing this post.  <br /><br />6. Jonathan Strange from Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell - I considered him for my original list but ultimately left him off. I can't totally remember why. Something about him being a little crazy. Except I mostly wrote this list LAST week cos I mixed up the weeks for this TTT topic. I can't remember my reason for leaving him off and I do like the guy. So can do magic, very clever, super devoted, all good reasons to add him to the list.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:12+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:12+00:00","published_at":"2013-04-02T13:57:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e0c5dde22fdcf0004b2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e0d5dde2223b60000c6","title":"March reading wrap-up","slug":"march-reading-wrap-up","url":"/articles/march-reading-wrap-up","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/March+calendar.jpg\" />Another month come and gone.

We've now read through chapter 20 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Thank you <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/03/harry-potter-readalong-order-of-phoenix_28.html\">Alice for hosting this suuuper fun potteralong</a> and be warned, there are spoilers ahead. I wrote down random thoughts as I was reading so be prepared for a not-at-all-coherent post.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />Fred, George, and Lee trying out their sweets on the first years is not cool. Especially, if Harry is correct, that they didn't tell the kids that they were guinea pigs for essentially a medical experiment.<br /><br />Hermione tricking the house elves into freedom is creepy too. It's one thing to want to set the house elves free (which I'm still sorta think is Hermione projecting her own wants and cultural understanding on others, even if freedom seems like it should be the way to go), but now she's tricking them. This also brings up lots of confusion how the whole \"house elf freedom via clothes\" things work.<br /><br />First, the house elves aren't her responsibility. They work for/belong to Hogwarts, so shouldn't the clothes have to come from Dumbledore or at least one of the other professors? How can Hermione free elves that aren't under her command? In CoS, Lucius is the one that (unknowingly) gave Dobby the clothes. If it didn't have to be him, you'd have thought Harry would have just given him something earlier.<br /><br />Second, these elves aren't being given clothes. They're just randomly finding them. Don't they have to be presented with clothes? I mean, we have tales of Kreacher snogging Sirius's dad's trousers in the last section, so it's not just picking up clothes that frees them. So even if Hermione could free elves by just giving them her hats, they would have to actually be given them, not just find them around, right? I am confused.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/whafillion.gif\" /><br />Hermione, quit being a bitch to Luna. She's amazing even if she is a bit spacey. And considering you're a witch you could believe in a little more whimsy. That said, Luna, I heart you but you're crazy. Perhaps don't believe in ALL THE THINGS<br /><br />Umbridge is so awful, which I know, understatement. Her detention for Harry is so so terrible. I really wish Harry had gone all Bartleby the Scrivner on her and just \"preferred not to\" to his detention.Or you know, had gone to Dumbles or McGonagall about it cos WTF? <br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/throwntable.gif\" /> Or this But then again, I understand why he doesn't go to anyone and just takes it. Well, I understand why he thinks this is what he has to do, even if it's dumb.<br /><br />It was a dick thing for Sirius to make the \"James woulda done it\" comment to Harry. Is it worse than the stuff Harry's been snapping at people? Slightly, because Sirius is an adult but it's closeg. It's childish sure, and something said when you're frustrated. And figure Sirius's frustration is probably at an all time high after the Daily Prophet story about how he's in London. And he's probably been hearing from others in the Order that he needs to stay inside EVEN HARDER than he has been. He probably figured Harry would think he should come out to visit, even if he wasn't actually going to do it. So yeah, he deserves to be smacked for the comment, but I still feel bad for the guy.<br /><br />Why is Hermione having such a hard time saying Voldemort? I know this is supposed to be something to show how brave she's being by saying it, but it's not like she grew up knowing you're supposed to fear the guy. It makes sense for Ron and other students from magical families, or those that dealt with Voldie's rein the first time around to fear his name. Muggle-born students, though?<br /><br />Good planning going to the Hog's Head instead of the Three Broomsticks for your secret meeting. Bad planning to think that just because there are no students around, you can speak freely. Even when you see suspicious characters all around the bar. I'm glad Mundungus was hanging around and hopefully would stop them if they were going to say anything someone around the bar REALLY shouldn't overhear. And glad Sirius told them to not do that again cos COME ON, Hermione. You should know better.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/judingyoualwayssunny.gif\" /><br />Harry's crush on Cho almost makes up for his angst. It's so cute.<br /><br />\"It would look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often\" - and this line makes me unreasonably sad. But really? It's THAT unusual for people in different houses to be friends? I'm thinking the hat is even more right in saying it's not such a great thing the students are split up.<br /><br />I am coming to terms with the fact that I really don't care about the Quidditch stuff. I glaze over whenever these games come up. Just let's get through it so we can get back to the interesting stuff. Because when the rest of the story is all life and death, I don't care so much about a sporting match.<br /><br />I also sorta glazed over during Hagrid's giant story, but I'm going to blame that on residual Quidditch glaze. But when Umbridge shows up and starts questioning Hagrid and is all suspicious about someone being there. She's very smart which makes her so much worse than the other villains Harry's tangled with.<br /><br />I apologize because this post is a mess. And I don't know how to end it so<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/nickmoonwalk.gif\" /><br />Also Sirius is an adult who has spent most of his adult life in prison being psychologically tortured. Can we congratulate both Harry &amp; Sirius for not turning into sociopaths? Because really, good job you guys. Color me impressed.<br /><br />Title quote from page 266<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

I mean, it's not THAT hard (cos, you know, the internet helps) but they aren't readily available in bookstores and even digital copies are rare. Which is lame because she's AMAZING and places need to stock more of her. Of course, that will only happen when demand...well demands it. So please start demanding her.<br /><br />OK, now that I got that out of the way, I should start talking about her book Fledgling, which was finally available on the Kindle one day. I'd heard very good things about it so I was excited to give this one a try. Especially because I'm nearing the end of the Butler bibliography, which sucks.<br /><br />Fledgling is the story of a young Ina/vampire named Shori. Shori wakes up one day badly injured and burned, with no memory of who she is or how she got there. Slowly it's revealed that Shori's family was wiped out, most likely by fellow vampires who were unhappy her family was experimenting with genetic mutations in order to produce offspring who can stay awake for the day and have better protection from the sun.<br /><br />I know Twilight cast a shadow over vampire books, whether you like that series or not. Both books actually came out a month apart from one another (Butler's in September, Meyers in October of 2005) so clearly the two books are in no way related, inspired, or anything with one another. As with most of Butler's novels, Fledgling deals with race. In this case Shori is the genetic experiment. Instead of having the very pale skin of her Ina ancestors, Shori has dark brown skin that doesn't burn so quickly in the sunlight. She's described by some of the vampire as a mongrel and less than Ina because her DNA has been mixed with human DNA.<br /><br />When Butler is dealing with race the novel really comes to life. Unfortunately, this isn't really the main focus of the story. Or it is, but a LOT of the story takes place with Shori learning about Ina ways and especially about her symbiots.<br /><br />See, in order to live, the vampires need to drink blood. As they do. And while technically they should be able to survive by just casually grazing (as they call it), the Ina whither away unless they bond with a human symbiot. This is more than just having someone around to regularly feed on, but it's an emotional connection with their people. The bond is so strong that if an Ina dies, their symbiots will likely die as well. If the vampire isn't in regular physical contact with their symbiots, regardless of if they feed on them, they will also die. Symbiots live unusually long lives (200+ years), free from health problems and derive extreme pleasure whenever their Ina feed from them. There are a lot more details about the relationship between Ina and their symbiots and had Butler lived longer, I feel like she probably would have written a few more novels about them, even if she does say Fledgling was just a lark.<br /><br />There's one thing though that I had trouble getting past. Shori is a young vampire, but vampires live a very long time (500 or so years). Shori's around 53 years old, which should make whatever she does with her adult symbiots fine. Except Shori LOOKS like an 11-12 year old. And she has sexy time with her adult symbiots (in addition to just feeding from them). And that was awkward. And happened a lot, especially in early parts of the novel. Later when she's dealing with finding out what happened to her family, this happens less often and I found I enjoyed the story more. (Also this is when we're dealing more with the race thing, where Butler really shines.) I tried not to think about it too much, cos thinking about it made me think I'm going to be put on a list for reading this book. Though at least nothing is TOO explicit.<br /><br />The other thing that I was sort of disappointed in was Shori's personality. Butler is great at writing strong female characters (which I've mentioned before) and Shori belongs in that group but near the bottom. She's stoic to the point of being monotone. She's lost everything and knows she can't even properly mourn her family because she doesn't remember them enough, but Shori hardly displayed any emotion. At times she would get angry and others would comment on her temper, but it never really came across to me. All of the female characters (at least those I've read) have been strong and somewhat stoic, but they still felt like real people and that they had real emotions behind their tough exterior. Shori didn't feel this way, which meant I didn't connect with her as much as the others.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Fledgling although not as much as the other Butler I've read. It's still a good one, and I'm still glad I read it, but if you're looking for some Butler to start with, might I recommend Kindred. Again. Because seriously, you need to read that one. It is superb.<br /><br />Title quote from location 3242<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E. Fledgling. Seven Stories Press, 2005.

This is the Harry Potter book I've never made it past when re-reading. I've read the whole series through once and then I've re-read the first 4 books a few times. But I get to this book and I stop. I can't go on. Except this is also my favorite book of the series. So go figure. This time I'm going to have to just accept that bad things are coming.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/picefacepr.gif\" />This is Harry at his teenage angsty-est. He has very good reasons for being so moody, considering the whole \"seeing Voldemort come back\" thing, and the \"no one will tell me what's going on and I'm stuck at the Dursley's\" thing, and finally the \"I'm 15 and teenagers are terrible\" thing. He has good reasons for snapping at everyone, and yet I still want someone to smack him upside the head and tell him to shut up. They can hug him after. But Mr. Shoutypants is sounding like a douche. (Especially in Umbridge's class when he's all \"Hmm let's think...maybe Lord Voldemort!\" and you just want to be like \"Really Harry? That the scathing line you went with? Maybe...ugh just sit down.\")<br />Why do I like this book the mostest? Cos we get MOAR SIRIUS.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LLdance.gif\" />Not just Sirius, but also Lupin and Tonks and actual Mad Eye, and all the best characters. How much do you want to be friends with Tonks? So much? So much. The order is now hanging out at the Black family home, using it for all important Order business. Poor Sirius can't leave, now that the Death Eaters know his Animagus form (dammit Wormtail, you asshole), and he (quite understandably) HATES his family home. Remember when I said I wanted to smack Harry for his moodiness? I'm more forgiving of Sirius's. Probably because I love him, but also because his moodiness doesn't manifest itself in snapping at his friends. And also cos he has gone through way more. Not to downplay Harry's anguish but Sirius spent 12g years being mentally tortured in Azkaban, so the fact that he's not a raving lunatic is pretty incredible.<br />How great was the Mrs. Weasley/Sirius parenting styles duel? \"Harry must be protected from all nasty things around him!\" vs \"Harry needs to know what he's up against!\" Boom! Pow! And Harry gets to be in the middle of all these people fighting over who's going to be his parent the hardest and HOW GREAT IS THAT?<br /><blockquote>\"He's not your son,\" said Sirius quietly<br />\"He's as good as,\" said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. \"Who else has he got?\"<br />\"He's got me!\"</blockquote>AWWWW. Harry deserves people fighting about who loves him the most. Especially after last week and we were all weeping over the fact that he'd never been hugged \"like by a mother\" and was so sad Sirius had to leave.<br /><br />That said, Mrs. Weasley's comment about how Sirius hasn't been a parent to him cos he's been locked up for 12 years is a low blow.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/notok.gif\" /> Not cool, Mrs. W \"Sirius, how dare you be unfairly locked up for a crime you didn't commit! Didn't you think of who would watch after Harry while you were being framed and then locked up without trial?\"<br /><br />Speaking of the whole Molly/Sirius battle, Mrs. Weasley may have a (slight) point when she tells Sirius to remember Harry isn't James. Of course she's also overlooking how much Sirius did to watch out for Harry in the fourth book. Unless her comment was building on an on-going argument they had been having that we didn't get to see, because we were hanging out with Harry at the Dursley's.<br />Kreacher is terrible. I forget how awful he is. I know, I know, Sirius is mean to him. Probably because Kreacher spends the whole time talking about how awful everyone is and calling them names that have been established are REALLY BAD. \"Mudblood\" is sort of \"the m-word\" of the wizarding world, yes? <br />So the O.W.L.s are super important. What happened to the students who were supposed to take their exams but didn't because if the Triwizard tournament? Do they have to make them up? Those kids are just screwed and can never get jobs now. <br /><br />Also how you do on your O.W.L.s determines what jobs you can apply to? That...that is so scary. You have to make these decisions when you're 15? What do I think of that, you ask?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Daria+career.jpg\" />We get to meet Luna. Luna, Luna, you're so great. Sure, you can be a little tactless sometimes, but I prefer that to you being worried about people thinking you're weird.  <br /><br />UMBRIDGE IS THE WORST. Remember how bad Rita Skeeter was? Umbridge is about a billion times worse. And the best villain of the series. Sorry, Voldie. And her Hem Hems? I'd like to set he on fire each time she does that. Plus how scary is it when McGonagall is afraid for Harry and his detention? I do not like it when the adults I trust in the series are afraid. It's not quite as bad as when Dumbles is afraid, but it's close.<br /><br />I'm afraid of/can't wait for next week's chapters. The feels. THE FEELS. <br /><br />Was Sirius in Azkaban for 12 or 13 years? Cos he escapes in the third book, which suggests 13 years cos that's how old Harry is in this one. But wasn't Harry a year old when Voldie killed his folks?  What's that? I could just ask the internet? I did, and the one thing says 13 years and doesn't explain.<br /><br />Title quote from page 40<br /><br />Rowling, J.K. Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix.

I didn't just make sure everyone knew the best book ever was on sale. I also scanned through the other books and found one to try out. And so I picked up The Financial Lives of Poets by Jess Walter.<br /><br />I've had this book on my radar since I read <a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/2010/01/financial-lives-of-poets-delightful.html\">Greg's review</a> waaaaay back in 2010. I trust his recommendations. After all, I liked <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/shouldnt-you-be-home-sitting-sheba\">Tropper's </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/shouldnt-you-be-home-sitting-sheba\">This Is</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/what-i-know-about-sitting-shiva\">Where I Leave You</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/day-you-take-on-real-job-with-real\">Norman's Domestic Violets</a>. Apparently he has become my go-to-guy for middle class white guy problem novels.<br /><br />The Financial Lives of Poets is a funny book about a middle class white guy dealing with his life falling down around him, primarily due to his ability to make terrible decision after terrible decision. It all starts with our main character Matt's grand idea to quit his job and start the website poetfolio.com. I think he describes it best: \"I know it sounds stupid in hindsight, and perhaps in foresight too, but my idea was that someone needed to start a website that gave financial news and advice...in verse.\" Just let that sink in for a minute.<br /><br />At no time does this sound like a sound business decision, but Matt happens to make it right as the housing bubble burst. He tried to crawl back to his old job as a business reporter, but the newspaper world isn't doing so well either, so that second round job didn't work out. Now he and his wife are drowning in debt and she's spending her free time flirting (or more?) with an old flame. So what's Matt to do?<br /><br />The book opens with him at 7/11 to pick up an overpriced jug of milk and he ends up partying with some teenage pot heads. Hey, remember when I said Matt is amazing at making terrible decisions? Yeah, he comes to the conclusion that to fix things he should sell pot! Genius! It's sorta like Weedsg. White middle class parent sells drugs to keep way of life!<br /><br />Except, not so much like Weeds. And overall I wasn't a huge fan of this one. There are a lot of funny lines but overall I went between not carrying so much about Matt or wanting to hit him. I sort of felt bad for the guy by the end, but it was tinged with my thoughts that he brought this on himself. Not a bad book, and not one I regret reading, but one I'm very happy I got on sale.<br /><br />But, since there are a lot of lines I like, I'm going to share a few here.<br /><br />\"Note: for future marriage-enriching banter, avoid Nazi humor.\"<br /><br />\"See! Fiscal Ebola? My financial asshole is bleeding? This was exactly why I started poetfolio.com; there are money poets everywhere!\"<br /><br />\"it dawns on me that Drug Dealer Dave's sales strategy might be a good one for realtors, too, beginning the home-buying process by pretending to want to search your asshole. Because, honestly, after that everything goes pretty smoothly.\"<br /><br />I really liked seasons 1 &amp; 2 of Weeds. After that I'm very eh on it. So my comparison is only for that part and less of the Mexican drug lord stuff that happens later.<br /><br />Title quote from page 71, location 1110<br /><br />Walter, Jess.

Happy Harry Potter day! Thank you <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/03/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-finishining.html\">Alice for hosting this readalong</a> which is all the fun. We now move on to the final part of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Be warned, there are spoilers.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />The end of this book is where shit starts to get real in HP land.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mhr7euRFiz1qz4rgp_zps3ec5cd0d.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_inline_mhr7euRFiz1qz4rgp_zps3ec5cd0d.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mhr7euRFiz1qz4rgp_zps3ec5cd0d.gif\" /></a></center>Even in the earlier books, when Harry is fighting Voldemort, things are fun and the kids are playing detective and the danger doesn't seem as real. It's there lurking, but there are other more pressing matters to deal with. The majority of Goblet of Fire was like that as well. Sure, someone wants to harm Harry, which is why he was put in the cup and the whole point of the book. But it seemed far more important that Harry do a good job in the tournament and make sure he find a dance to the ball. But not the end. The end is when everything goes dark and you realize exactly what is at stake and what it means for Voldie to be back.<br /><br />I ended up listening the this last section entirely on audiobook. I didn't mean to but I ended up spending extra time on the train, which meant more time to listen. Then I thought about reading the end of it at home, cos you know, the sadz and I don't need to be crying over imaginary people while on the subway.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m7c6dnPcgW1qfymwo.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_m7c6dnPcgW1qfymwo.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m7c6dnPcgW1qfymwo.gif\" /></a></center>But I really wanted to finish the book. I knew how it ended but I still didn't want to read something else in the meantime. However, the audio isn't as bad as if I had been reading it. I think had that been the case, it would have been a lot of awkward ugly crying going on.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is what happens after Harry comes back and he's told his story to Dumbledore. It's Harry trying to process everything he's been through, it's Fudge being a jackass and not believing him, it's Sirius being so protective of Harry, it's Snape acknowledging he was a death eater and agreeing to take up whatever dangerous post he had previously held when Voldie was in power the first time, it's Dumbledore's speech that everyone remember Cedric Diggory.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/too+much.gif\" />Clearly this isn't the happiest part of the book but it's the part I find myself going back to.<br /><br />Lighter note, for the second and third challenge, what exactly were the spectators watching? The first one it made sense, cos they could actually watch the champions try to get the egg from the dragon. But then at the lake they were underwater the whole time. The merpeople had to tell Dumbledore what took Harry so long, so I think it's safe to assume there weren't some sort of underwater cameras letting the people watch the action. Same deal with the maze. If they COULD have seen what was going on in the maze, then they would have see Mad-Eye clearing the way for Harry while attacking the others, and Krum getting all imperious-ed. <br /><br />Other than the \"the spectators can't spectate anything\" I don't really have any random thoughts to list out. Probably because I am just focused on that ending.<br /><br />Next up Order of the Phoenix which is my favorite book but also one I sorta hate FOR  REASONS that are obvious if you've read the book. If not then just know REASONS. <br /><br />Title quote from page 723<br /><br />Rowling, J.K. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

I'm going to try to make it coherent. I am. But there's going to be a lot of gushing.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Lamb+cover.jpg\" />Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore is my most favoritest book. It's hilarious. It's touching. It's though provoking. It literally makes me laugh out loud and ugly cry. (Not the same scenes. That'd be schizophrenic.) An old co-worker of mine tried to get me to read the book for months and I don't know why I didn't listen to her at once. I'm stupid like that. But I finally did read it and I loved it.<br /><br />The book is about the life of Joshua (aka Jesus, which is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Yeshua and not like a fake name for the guy) focusing on the parts the Bible missed. And who better to tell that story than his BFF Biff (aka Levi, Biff is his nickname and the sound of someone smacking him upside the head)? The majority of the tale follows Josh and Biff as they travel to the east to meet with the three Magi and learn what Josh needs to know to become the Messiah.<br /><br />I feel like with that description I need to add two different disclaimers. On the one hand, it sounds like a religious story. I mean it is about Jesus and the Magi and the end of the book deals with the Jesus's teachings in its own ways. I wouldn't say I'm particularly religious. I am technically Catholic, though I haven't been to church in a long time. I know the times to stand up, sit down, kneel; I know what to say at the appropriate times; I know some of the bigger Bible stories, and that's about it. So what I'm saying is you don't need to be particularly religious to love this book.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are very religious, you also shouldn't worry about this book being blasphemous and anger inducing. When I went to a book signing for Moore's <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/artist-cant-let-madness-stop-him-from\">Sacre Bleu</a> he was talking about Lamb and how worried he was that people would be so mad at this book at him for defiling Jesus. And how surprised he was that he never got any of that backlash. Not only that, but the book is being taught at Harvard Divinity School. So even if you are religious, you should read this book. Cos you'll probably love it.<br /><br />What I'm saying is everyone should read this and love it.<br /><br />Like other Moore books, this one has sex and creative cursing and all that good stuff. And things like the origin of Judo (or Jew-do, a form of kung-fu taught to Joshua by the Shaolin monks because \"what if Jesus knew kung-fu\" is an important question that needs answered). And if Josh is really to understand sin, who better than Biff to explain it to him? It even has characters from other books, like Catch from <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/are-you-sayingthat-human-race-was\">Practical Demonkeeping</a> and Raziel from <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/blessed-are-minimarshmallows\">The Stupidest Angel</a>. See, hilarious.<br /><br />It's Biff and Josh's relationship that is the best. Biff is sarcastic (he did invent it after all), a quick thinker, and fiercely loyal to Josh. Besides, who else is willing to hang out with all those hookers, just so he can describe sin to Josh? Josh needs someone to help him learn to be the Messiah, but he also needs someone to help him be human. He needs a friend.<br /><br />There are a lot of scenes I like. Pretty much all of them. But I went back and re-read this passage a few times. I don't remember it standing out the first time around, but something about this was so touching this time.<br /><blockquote>I don't know, having lived and died the life of a man, I can write about little-boy love, but remembering it now, it seems the cleanest pain I've know. Love without desire, or conditions, or limits - a pure and radiant glow in the heart that could make me giddy and sad and glorious all at once. Where does it go? Why, in all their experiments, did the Magi never try to capture that purity in a bottle? Perhaps they couldn't. Perhaps it is lost to us when we become sexual creatures, and no magic can bring it back. Perhaps I only remember it because I spent so long trying to understand the love that Joshua felt for everyone. (26)</blockquote>I'm sorry this review is rambling and gushing. But I warned you when I started this it was going to be a mess. Cos I can't put into words everything I love about the book. I was actually afraid when I started re-reading this that I wasn't going to love it as much as I remembered. How could it live up to those expectations? What if I built it up too much? But it met those expectations. I loved it just as much this time around (and cried just as hard during the end) as I did the first time.<br /><br />All the stars and moons and whatever other book rating measurement I could go with, even though I don't actually use them. But ALL OF THEM!<br /><br />Title quote from page 17<br /><br />Moore, Christopher. Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.

Once again we have another Harry Potter readalong post (<a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/03/harry-potter-readalong-harry-potters.html\">and thank you Alice for hosting this potteralong</a>).<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />As with every week, there are spoilers below. And also bitching about really minor details and the fact that Rowling can't do math. The usual. So let's go<br /><br />I LOVE Hermione's scenes when she's yelling at Ron about taking her for granted and not thinking anyone else would want to go to the dance with her. Hermione, you rule<br /><br />Harry and Ron were both jerks during the dance. But not really more than normal 14 year old boy jerks. Doesn't mean it's OK, but it does mean (from my perspective) it's understandable. And had the girls smacked each of the boys upside the head, that would have been understandable too. <br /><br />When Harry is caught in the trick step and he drops the egg AND the Marauder's Map, and Filch, Snape and Moody show up, how many times did you mumble \"Motherfucker\"? It was 7 for me.  <br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/xhCDt.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo xhCDt.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/xhCDt.gif\" /></a><br />I'd like to get an indication of how much help all of the other Champions are getting. Cos Harry would have been screwed at pretty much every step of that second task. He couldn't figure out the egg without both Cedric and Moaning Myrtle telling him what to do. He couldn't figure out how to stay underwater for an hour without Dobby. Hell, he would have missed the task ENTIRELY without Dobby. And he couldn't find his way to the hostages without Myrtle again.g We know Fleur and Krum were told about the Dragons before the first task by their headmasters (probably) and Harry told Cedric but are any of them getting this much help? This is getting sad.<br /><br />Another point to add to the 'I love you Rowling, but you suck at math\" file, she has Hagrid pull out a picture of him as a young boy with his father sitting on his shoulder. Except then she says in the picture Hagrid is smaller than he is now, about 7-8 feet tall. Which...that's not HUGE. It's bigger than the average person sure, but not so big that a full sized normal adult man can fit on his shoulder.  <br /><br />Sirius is back. More back than just head-in-the-fire-place back. Now it's spending-most-of-his-time-as-a-dog-and-living-off-rats back. Which he's doing because he CARES FOR HARRY THAT MUCH. Because he's great.  <br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mga1l0Vs7O1rq9ki3.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_inline_mga1l0Vs7O1rq9ki3.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mga1l0Vs7O1rq9ki3.gif\" /></a></center>Though I kinda feel bad for Buckbeak who's probably thinking \"What the hell is this? We were hanging out somewhere nice and warm and now we're back here living in a cave that who knows how the hell I fit in AND I'm living off scraps? This is bullshit, food guy.\" <br /><br />Sirius's story about Barty Crouch and him being all I HATE DARK WIZARDS RAWR. I get that it's sad and sucks that Crouch sent his son to Azkaban and that makes him seem all heartless. But if he DIDN'T do this, and he kept his son out of Azkaban and got him special treatment, wouldn't that be what we're bitching about? Poor Crouch was screwed either way.<br /><br />Winky gets drunk on butterbeer so does that mean butterbeer is kinda alcoholic? Cos even Harry(?) says something about it not really being that strong before Dobby tells him it's strong to house elves. Is the \"beer\" part of the drink true, albeit very light?

Aww even though he's a professional Quidditch player Krum is intimidated by Harry. Which he really shouldn't be. Sorry Harry. <br /><br />Oh hey, Crouch as showed up. And he's clearly delusional and spouting nonsense and apparently wandering around the forest. So that's creepy. And while I'm glad Harry ran to get help, I can't help but think it would have been a good idea to first move Crouch OUT of the forest. Maybe out into the open. Not to say that would have prevented what happened from happening, but still.<br /><br />ALSO, so I know Snape is a super asshole and obviously Harry hates him, etc. but I couldn't help thinking it would have probably been a good thing for Harry-Snape relations if he had tried to bring Snape outside when he realized he couldn't get to Dumbledore. Like instead of yelling at Snape that he needed to get Dumbles for him if he had been like \"Fine Snape, you have to come quick!!\" First up, then Snape sees that Harry is serious because OBV Harry wouldn't be asking Snape for something if it wasn't a big deal. And Snape helping Harry would put them both in a better mindset about the other. They're not going to be besties but less tense? Think how much better Snape's rescue of HRH would have been in Prisoner of Azkaban if Snape actually HAD rescued them instead of sending Sirius to the dementors.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Snape+&amp;+Harry.jpg\" /> How things could have been Next week, we finish things up with Goblet and THINGS WILL BE REVEALED.

And you are going to be disappointed. I'm sorry. I cannot live up to all your expectations. Not the book. The book is super fun, but this review.  <br /><br />So I read Agorafabulous!. And I really liked it! It was a fast read and I couldn't put it down. And then I started a new book and apparently forgot about it completely because not only have I not written a review for it yet, but I've written reviews for books I finished after it. Which I never do. I like to write the reviews in the order I read the books, even if they end up piling up. But I forgot all about it. So I don't really know what that means. When I think of the book, I remember really liking it. But apparently I don't think of it that often.<br /><br />I put Agorafabulous!: Dispatches from My Bedroom by Sara Benincasa on my Goodreads To Read list after I saw <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/06/giant-cartoon-bees-and-agoraphobia.html\">Alice's review</a>. Then one day I had to make a trip to work up to Boston and I was almost done with the book I was reading and was afraid if I just bought it, I would be bookless. These are times I LOVE my Kindle because the night before the trip I can go \"Shit I need a book for tomorrow. Oh here we go.\" And thus, I picked up Agorafabulous.<br /><br />The book is a hilarious memoir of her struggles with Benincasa's various anxieties, primarily her agoraphobia. The stories are funny without sacrificing the seriousness of her condition. Agoraphobia is serious, even if the results are absurd. Plus she pulled me in cos she's a Jersey girl who went to school in Boston, so I can appreciate her comments like \"New Jersey claims to be a state, but it is actually a gigantic slab of cement upon which malls sprout like blisters and corns on the scrubby feet of overworked, chain-smoking strippers,\"g because this is not untrue.<br /><br />Benincasa takes us through her trip to Sicily and her first serious panic attack, her agoraphobia in college when she couldn't even go to the bathroom and instead peed in bowls, to working as a personal assistant for an abusive spiritual guru, teaching in Texas, and eventually becoming a comedian in NYC. The settings are different but she's still dealing with her anxieties and his hilarious the whole time so it's cool.<br /><br />I can't really think of what else to say but while I was looking through my highlights to write this I realized I would just like to share a bunch of quotes. Because they're GREAT.<br /><br />\"Thus did I end up in Sicily, the Alabama of Italy.\"<br /><br />\"Our particular trip was enlivened by the presence of a foursome of bitchtastic bottle blondes from the girls' tennis team. This cuntsquare of future real estate agents and PR associates...\"<br /><br />\"Any average crazy person can worry one friend into action. But two? That's advanced achievement in the art of being nuts.\"<br /><br />\"I wasn't rich enough to follow my dream of living among noble brown stereotypes, which is why this book isn't called Eat, Pray, Love.\"<br /><br />\"On any given block in New York, I was bound to be, if not the sanest individual, at least not one of the craziest.\"<br /><br />If I didn't have this on Kindle, I'd stick it on my shelf right next to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">The Bloggess's Let's Pretend</a> book and I could have a \"hilarious memoir by ladies with mental problems\" shelf. It can sit next to my \"white middle class straight guy problems\" shelf. If I ever get around to organized my bookshelves, these are the types of categories I'm going with.<br /><br />I realized after I already wrote this paragraph that Alice also quoted this line in her review. Because it's that good.<br /><br />Title quote from page 235/location 3278<br /><br />Benincasa, Sara. Agorafabulous! Dispatches from My Bedroom. Harper Collins, 2012. Kindle edition.

Plus this is the copy I have in hardback, just to make it that much heavier. And since I do most of my reading on the subway I decided screw that. I'll do any actual reading when I'm at home and anything while commuting is audio.<br /><br />Oh as with last week, I still can't upload gifs like I used to, so I have to make due with the ones I already have, which unfortunately isn't THAT many since I normally just find them as I'm writing this deal. If anyone would like to offer advice on how they do this, I am ALL EARS because Photobucket is frustrating the hell out of me.<br /><br />And with that, onto my random thoughts!<br /><br />Hermione, Hermione, Hermione. You named your cause S.P.E.W.?<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lq6sd25MEw1qcj56b.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_lq6sd25MEw1qcj56b.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lq6sd25MEw1qcj56b.gif\" /></a></center>S.P.E.W. is an awful name. She really needs to think how these things sound if she wants to get people on her side. It's been pretty well establish that the wizarding community is TERRIBLE towards anyone that's not a magical human, so already she's fighting an uphill battle. No need to shoot herself in the foot. That said, I do appreciate her suggest to retitle Hogwarts, A History to A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School. Still not a great name, (and certainly not a fun acronym) but it's at least funnier.<br /><br />Last week I wanted to give Harry a big hug after he was thinking how much he wanted a parent to talk to. This week it's Neville right after Moody's class. Or when he's still sitting up late, even though Harry totally doesn't notice this because Harry is not the most observant of other people. Neville needs a big hug almost more than Harry, cos Harry is at least SUPER beloved and amazing at Quidditch and has lots of money and other wonderful things that happened to him. Poor Neville is mostly a bumbling mess.<br /><br />Speaking of hugs, I was recently watching Pushing Daisies and Chuck has a great quote about hugs. PLUS that show is narrated by Jim Dale, who also narrated the HP audiobooks so see, it's all connected. Anyway that quote:<br />Chuck: I can't even hug you? What if you need a hug? A hug can turn your day around.<br />Ned: I'm not a fan of the hug.<br />Chuck://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/><img alt=\" photo tumblr_inline_mhq5eb4tLV1qz4rgp_zpsbe363d53.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mhq5eb4tLV1qz4rgp_zpsbe363d53.gif\" /> Chien-Po gets hugs <center></center>I love seeing the other wizarding schools. Do the students who came have to take all of their classes in English? That seems difficult, but I guess everyone just speaks English?<br /><br />Rita Skeeter is an amazing/terrible character, just behind Umbridge in characters you most wish would die in a fire. But as a reporter, Skeeter is terrible. She's not actually the one writing her stories, her magic floaty pen deal does that. And she makes shit up constantly. I mean going beyond manipulating the story to just flat our writing stuff that never happened, quotes that were never said. I'm not saying this doesn't happen in the real world, but I'd like to think it's less obvious. The Daily Prophet needs to up their standards.<br /><br />Ron and Harry fighting is so sad. Almost sadder than Harry and Ron being mean to Hermione, except that was way worse and they were way doucheier. But since the story is from Harry's POV and we see how sad he is, that makes it seem worse. Poor guy, getting yelled at for something he didn't even do.<br /><br />Yay Sirius is back! Kinda! Head in the fireplace but good enough.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_md5avuSvJd1qdni2zo1_500.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_md5avuSvJd1qdni2zo1_500.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_md5avuSvJd1qdni2zo1_500.gif\" /></a></center><br />How much do you want one of those little dragon things the Champions pulled out of the bag? So much? So much.<br /><br />I'm really glad Harry didn't outfly Krum in the first task. I know Harry's a great flyer and all, but being better than a professional Quidditch player would have been a bit much.<br /><br />Poor Winky. I'm glad Dobby is doing well, with his one Galleon a week and one day off a month. Quite the negotiating skills, that one. Although I don't know what to do about Hermione's S.P.E.W. Cos on the one hand (other than the name) it's obviously a good thing to make sure the house elves have rights and are treated respectfully. But then there's the fact that they don't seem to want everything Hermione is trying to give them. And then I don't really know what to think.<br /><br />Well I don't really know how to end this, so let's go with some great advice from Metatron<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m3o2yubtvO1rnvwt1.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_m3o2yubtvO1rnvwt1.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m3o2yubtvO1rnvwt1.gif\" /></a></center>Till next week!<br /><br />Title quote from page 217<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

Here's the thing about this, I don't have 10 authors I auto-buy. Not even close. But I still like the topic and I want to play along. So here is my short list of authors whose books I will buy even if I know nothing about the book. Or if I already have a copy. (Warning: this is is going to be repetitive of my favorite authors lists. So yeah, don't expect surprises here.)<br /><br />1. Jasper Fforde - I'm putting him first because my friend told me he found a stack of Shades of Grey on sale and asked if I wanted him to pick up one for me. Even though I already have two copies of it. The answer was yes. I haven't read all of his books just yet, because I like to wait for books to come out in paperback. This is actually the reason I had 2 copies of Shades. I wanted to read the book immediately so I bought an e-copy. Then I found another paperback copy on sale and said \"Yes, I will also need this one.\"<br />Other Fforde books I've read &amp; reviewed/rambled about here<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/they-kep-eye-onovertly-free-thespian\">The</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/my-quote-as-title-idea-is-already\">Eyre</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">Affair </a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/thats-realworld-for-you-brutal-and\">One of Our Thursdays is Missing</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/humpty-dumpty-fall-guy\">The Big Over Easy </a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/apart-we-are-together\">Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron</a> <br /> <br />2. Christopher Moore - I have already bought and read all of the Moore books out so far. Before I got to that point, I would randomly walk into a book store and pick out whatever Moore book looked interesting that I hadn't already read. It was a sad day when I realized I'd read all of his books already, so trips to the bookstore didn't mean I'd be guaranteed something new by him. I even broke down and got a hardback copy of his most recent book Sacre Bleu, but that's because <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/book-signings-or-there-will-be-bragging\">he came to town for a book signing and I HAD to go</a>. Had to. I may end up getting a copy in paperback as well because I have problems.

Bill Bryson - I love Bryson and there's a good chance I've re-read his work the most. Moore and Fforde are close but Bryson's easy to pick up and put down randomly without worrying about losing the story. The only problem I have is it can be difficult to find him in bookstores. Fforde and Moore are easy cos they just show up in Fiction. Bryson is all over. Sometimes history, sometimes travel, sometimes I don't even know. I usually just find him on those tables placed around the store.<br />BRYSON!<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/it-is-remarkable-to-think-that-people\">At Home:</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/for-anyone-of-rational-disposition\">A Short History of Private Life</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/goog_1878200967\">The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/more-than-300-million-people-in-world\">The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-loved-idea-that-you-could-never-be\">Neither Here Nor There:</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/travel-is-more-fun-hell-life-is-more\">Travels in Europe</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/shakespeare-is-kind-of-literary\">Shakespeare: The World as Stage</a> <br /><br />Who are your author auto-buys?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:17+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:17+00:00","published_at":"2013-02-26T17:06:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e115dde226419000592","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e115dde22fdcf0004b5","title":"Homicide intrigues virtually all of us","slug":"homicide-intrigues-virtually-all-of-us","url":"/articles/homicide-intrigues-virtually-all-of-us","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Will+to+Kill+cover.jpg\" />As I've said a few times (and is listed over in my little about me blurb) I studied English lit in college. However, I had another subject I think I would have been just as happy studying: sociology. In fact, I almost got a minor in sociology, sorta by accident. My school had a program which lets you put in your ID, select the degree you're going for, and it tells you which classes you have left to take to finish the degree. One day I was plugging in my information to see what came up and it turned out, I was a couple classes away from a sociology minor. I wasn't planning on it, but given I was close to finishing it, I may as well.<br /><br />That was the plan anyway. Then my friend said \"Hey you know what we should do? Study abroad!\" Here's the thing about doing a semester abroad. None of the classes I needed for either my English major or my soc minor were offered in Italy. Go figure, right? Which meant that my final year was going to be spent taking the classes I needed to complete my English degree. Yeah, I may have been able to take extra classes and get the soc minor but eh. So I ended up not getting it. Which is kinda sad. But the interest has always been there, specifically sociology around crime.<br /><br />Our final year boyfriend+ and his bestie took a class called Sociology of Violence, which thinking back now I'm not sure why I didn't also take it cos it sounds like a good time. I didn't take the class, but I did read their class book The Will to Kill: Explaining Senseless Murder by James Alan Fox and Jack Levin. Before they finished it. Because yeah, why not read that along with the books I had to read for all of my classes.<br /><br />It was because of the Harry Potter readalong that I wanted to re-read this. Well Harry Potter and the fact that I felt like reading some non-fiction and decided to scour the shelves to see what I hadn't read in awhile. But yeah, HP deals with a lot of crimes and whatnot, though in the magical sense, but still.<br /><br />I'm not really sure how to review this book, because it is sort of a text book. Kinda of. There are lots of charts and stats and references to specific murder cases and sociological experiments. So if that's your jam, this is a good book for it. But it's dry. There's no narrative here. The chapters are split into different types of murder (familiar, school shootings, serial killers, etc), and the laws and penalties around murder.<br /><br />The book doesn't actually explain senseless murder but really, how can it? It looks at some theories about WHY people commit murder, it can examine the trends (at least in the US) in murder rates, but it doesn't have any definitive answers. If it did offer some, that would be a problem because they would clearly be bullshit.<br /><br />There are times when the book just seems to offer example after example after example of specific murders that sort of seems like over kill. Two examples would suffice where they use seven. Except, I sort of don't mind this. The examples do build to a bigger point, even if you could get away with using less, but I liked them. Probably because I have problems. There's also a chapter about people's fascination with murder, so don't worry, they cover that too.<br /><br />I don't know that I'd recommend this to someone as a book to randomly pick up to read about murder. Unless you were interested in looking at murder trends in the US. It's not as approachable as say Freakonomics. Though this book does reference Freakonomics, just as Freakonomics mentioned Fox because everything is connected. It's not as dry as a textbook (and there are no study questions at the end of the chapters) but it's not exactly a lively read. Unless you're into this stuff, in which case keep in mind I read this on top of all of my other school work.<br /><br />Title quote from page 1<br /><br />Fox, James Alan and Jack Levin.

Callooh Callay and what not.<br /><br />As always thank you <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/02/harry-potter-readalong-goblet-of-fire.html\">Alice for hosting this readalong shindig</a>. And thar be spoilers, so you've been warned.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" />I'm giving up all hope that I can write one of these Harry Potter posts that's not made up of just random bullet points. To those of you that can manage it, I salute you because that is impressive.<br /><br />Goblet of Fire. The first book that's split into four books instead of two because there's SO MUCH to go through. However this isn't really my favorite book. It's not lower than CoS but it's around there. Again, this doesn't mean it's a BAD book. This is all relative to the other books in the series. Also I don't remember books 6 or 7 all that well, so I could be wrong.<br /><br />The opening chapter and we break away from Harry's point of view. I don't know how I feel about this. On the one hand, we can't know what's happening with Voldie unless Harry sees it and we need to know what he's up to. But I like sticking to Harry's point of view. I know Rowling sort of gets away with this by having the opening chapter also be Harry's dream, but that doesn't really work for me. It feels like a cheat.<br /><br />However I LOVE the first chapter directly from Harry's point of view (aka Chapter 2), when his scar hurts and he decides to turn to Sirius for help. Because Harry needs a parent. And I'm still thinking of  <a href=\"https://jennysbooks.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/revisiting-harry-potter-sirius-black-and-other-concerns/\">Jenny's defense of Sirius</a> because it is so good and this opening just serves to prove how much Harry needs a parent. Even he says it. \"What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like -- someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him.\" Then my heart breaks again for him and I want to give him big hugs.<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mhq5eb4tLV1qz4rgp_zpsbe363d53.gif.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\" photo tumblr_inline_mhq5eb4tLV1qz4rgp_zpsbe363d53.gif\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mhq5eb4tLV1qz4rgp_zpsbe363d53.gif\" /></a><center></center>We get to meet the rest of the Weasley brood when Bill and Charlie finally make an appearance. Naturally they're the cool older brothers. How the hell did Percy end up in this family? He is so different from everyone else. He's like the black sheep? Except not? Grey sheep maybe?<br /><br />I love the scenes before the Quidditch World Cup (which like the student games I'm sort of meh on) when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are wandering around the grounds and seeing all of the witches and wizards from around the world. There's also evidence in this section that Hogwarts is the only wizarding school in the UK, since they make a point of saying that the teens they don't recognize go to schools in other countries, rather than them being students at other UK schools. I did like the little nod to the American witches being from Salem. Cute.<br /><br />Do you think all those memory charms are going to screw with Mr. Roberts? I feel bad for the guy. I know Mr. Weasley says any ill effects don't last long, but still. Seems like the sort of thing that should be used sparingly, given we saw what happened to Gildaroy Lockhart when the spell is performed too strongly? Not to say anyone's going to do that to the Muggles, but just that there are possible bad side effects to this spell.<br /><br />Poor Winky. First she has to go up to the top box even though she's terrified of heights. Then she's blamed for the dark mark that's sent out AND she's fired. Except I guess for house elves it's more than fired? It's not like she can just put out an ad and find another family, right?<br /><br />Also question, Harry says that his wand fell out of his pocket, right? (Or there is at least references to wands being in pockets at some point in the series.) But wants are pretty long right? Sometimes over a foot. What pockets are they using? I now like to picture Harry with JNCO jeans that have those GIANT pockets, of course then he couldn't really run. Nevermind, they're probably magic pockets. <br /><br />The prank pulled on the Roberts is really terrifying, especially when you consider the two children. I don't know why it hit me that it's really a cruel and scary thing to do this time around when other times I sort of glossed over it. This time I paid more attention to it. Maybe because I listened to that part on audiobook.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I've been doing about 1/2 of the books on audiobook and the other 1/2 reading. This way I a) don't need to bring giant books on the subway with me and b) when I finish up the section we're supposed to read to, I can turn off the audiobook and switch to whatever other book I'm reading. Hence my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/are-audiobooks-cheating\">thoughts on audiobooks</a> earlier.<br /><br />Hermione makes a very good point about house elves being slave labor. That doesn't not however make her less insufferable or make Ron any less correct when he says Hermione starts eating again because she's hungry more than she's figured other ways to show her house elf solidarity.<br /><br />Hagrid, I want to love you as a professor. I do. But blast-ended skrewts? No thank you.<br /><br />\"'Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?' said Ron\" Hooray for them acting like teenagers and making stupid jokes like this. (Also, while typing this I have the TV on and the people are in Beaver, PA.

In this recent case, it went to old episodes of Home Improvement. Specifically I was thinking about one episode where Tim listens to some books on tape. It's from the episode \"Her Cheatin' Mind\"g. Jill has joined a book club and Tim is afraid she's falling for one of the guys in the group, so he decides he's going to join. But instead of reading the book he listens to them on tape. At the end of the episode Randy decides instead of reading A Tale of Two Cities he'll just listen to it. And we get this exchange:<br /><br />Randy: After I've finished my homework.<br />Tim: You need any help?<br />Randy: No. Just got a little book to read. [Randy waves a cassette tape to Tim] Tale of Two Cities.<br />Tim: Don't play a tape. Read the book will you, Randy.<br />Randy: I got the idea from you.<br />Tim: Well, don't tell your Mom you got the idea from me.<br />Randy: Don't worry Dad. She's not going to find out. [Randy puts the tape into the player and turns it on]<br />Tape: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.<br />Jill's voice from the tape: It's going to be the worst of times for you if you don't turn this off and go read the book. Oh, and I don't care what your father told you.<br /><br />Ahaha hilarity as Jill gets the better of her son and husband and makes them do the real work and actually read a book.<br />Except wait, what? Why is it such a big deal that he actually reads the book? It's not like he was trying to watch the movie instead. There's a big difference between watching the movie and reading the book. But is having someone read the book to you such a problem. How is this different than actually reading the book?<br /><br />OK fine, you can argue that if someone is reading the book to you then there are certain things the reader decides for you, like the tone of certain lines or even the characters' voice. But that's not the same as having the entire look and feel of a story decided by a movie. And I certainly don't see how listening to an audiobook would count as cheating on your homework if the assignment was read the book. Actually, this is something I wish I had thought of in college. It would have been nice to be able to do my homework and get some cleaning or gym time or whathaveyou done. And I don't see how this would have been any less than actually looking at the words on a piece of paper.<br />So what do you think? Is there any validity to this? Is listening to an audiobook akin to cheating on homework? Is it less than actual reading? Or have I just spent way too much time remembering Home Improvement plots instead of more important facts?<br /><br />Wikipedia didn't have a good enough description to tell me this was indeed the episode I was thinking of. HOWEVER I managed to find a <a href=\"http://www.hiarchive.co.uk/index.php?content=script&amp;s=5&amp;e=3\">full script of the episode</a> online because that's what the internet is for.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:18+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:18+00:00","published_at":"2013-02-20T13:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e125dde223867000255","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"audiobooks","slug":"audiobooks","url":"/articles/tags/audiobooks"}]}]},{"id":"53224e135dde2223b60000d6","title":"Give me twenty-four hours, and I will marry you off to a clown","slug":"give-me-twenty-four-hours-and-i-will-marry-you-off-to-a-clown","url":"/articles/give-me-twenty-four-hours-and-i-will-marry-you-off-to-a-clown","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Care+to+make+love...cover.jpg\" />During a recent trip to the bookstore Boyfriend+ came across the book Care to Make Love in That Gross Little Space Between Cars?: A Believer Book of Advice. The Believer, according to Wikipedia, is a literary magazine founded by Dave Eggers. I guess they have a Q&amp;A section where readers can send in their questions and then comedians offer advice. Like a really messed up Dear Abby. And this book is made up of a collection of those advice columns.<br /><br />So if it wasn't clear from the fact that I had to look up The Believer on Wikipedia, I'm not familiar with this publication. However, I am familiar with many of the contributors to the advice column, including Louis CK, Nick Hornby, Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Schaal, Amy Sedaris, and a bunch more. So we decided \"why not\" and threw it on the pile to take home with us.<br /><br />The book has funny moments. Louis CK is asked by someone what a MILF is cos she was recently called one and wants to know if she should be offended. Louis CK's answer: \"MILF is a common acronym used by kids these days. It stands for \"Ugly Bitch Who Lies About Some Kid Calling Her a MILF.\" (His whole section is a bit hostile, though his intro warns he's been having a bad day.)<br /><br />When asked what books one should read on the subway to make fellow riders look on in awe, George Saunders suggests the following titles:<br />Common Problems of the Very Wealthy, Well-Endowed, and Omniscient<br />Why Can't I Stop Loving So Selflessly, and Being Such an Incredible Cook?<br />Eyes Up, Moronic Commuter! There's a Whole Beautiful World Out There!<br />What Are You Looking at My Book for, When a Guy with Advanced-Stage TB Is About to Cough Down Your Neck?<br />Care to Make Love in That Gross Little Space Between Cars?<br /><br />The book suffers from the problem I have with all books that have a bunch of authors. The book is uneven with some parts being great, and some being very \"meh\". Unfortunately, even the comedians I liked were sort of meh. I smirked a few times or thought \"that's funny\" but never actually laughed while reading this. Maybe it's because a lot of the questions and answers sound so forced. Obviously people writing in know what they're getting into, but it's almost like everyone is too in on the joke.<br /><br />Funny concept but not so funny follow through.

Thank you <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/02/harry-potter-readalong-week-i-dont-even.html\">Reading Rambo for hosting this gif-filled readalong</a>.<br /><br />So the Northeast got hit with blizzard Nemo over the weekend, which meant I had a lot of time to sit around the house and read. It also meant that while I was reading I was sitting near my computer and could write down my thoughts as I went, instead of trying to remember them all at the end. Which is the reason I have actual quotes this time. And also why I spent so much time thinking of Hogwarts math. As with every other readalong post, thar be spoilers ahead. Be warned.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />I love the Patronus charm and the idea that the spell is based on happy thoughts. However, Harry's motivation for learning the charm, so he can make sure he doesn't fall off his broom and thus lose the Quidditch Cup, is very lame. And Ron said Hermione's priorities were messed up in the first book.<br /><br />I do think the best part about Harry's Patronus lessons is the fact that he sort of doesn't want to successfully produce the Patronus because then he won't be able to hear his parents, even though he's hearing their dying words. That is so heartbreaking. I just want to hug him.  <br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m7c6dnPcgW1qfymwo.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m7c6dnPcgW1qfymwo.gif\" /></a></center>Except then I remember that he and Ron are going weeks without talking to Hermione because she tried to save his life by making sure the Firebolt isn't going to kill him, and then I want to smack him upside the head. Then hug him.<br /><br />Overall I'm not a fan of any of the Quidditch scenes. Then again, I'm not a huge sports fan anyway so this is nothing against Rowling. However I do enjoy Lee Jordan and McGonagall's arguments during his commentary.<br /><br />\"I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats.\" Damn straight! You tell 'em, Hagrid. Stupid Ron and Harry need to BE NICER TO HERMIONE.<br /><br />\"Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\" Snape may be an asshole, but he makes a very good point. Obviously Lupin makes the same point that actually gets through to Harry, but still, the idea is the same.<br /><br />Earlier in this readalong we guessed there are about 10 kids per house per grade, based roughly on how many Griffindors there are in Harry's year. So there are 7 grades at Hogwarts so each house would have about 70 students. Except during the Quidditch match Griffindor vs. Slytherine it says there are 200 people wearing green. The scene at breakfast suggested that Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are also rooting for Griffindor (cos everyone hates Slytherin) so who is making up all 200? So I asked the internet for an answer and apparently Rowling gave an interview in 2000 and said there are 1,000 students at Hogwarts. The folks at Beyond Hogwarts argue that this makes no sense, and they guess closer to the 10 students per house per grade. So I know since Rowling wrote the books her answer should be the correct one, but since most of the other stuff she wrote doesn't support that (except maybe this scene with 200 Slytherins) I'm choosing to believe the smaller number.<br /><a href=\"http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/doing-the-math-how-many-kids-are-at-hogwarts.html\">Doing the math: how many kids are at Hogwarts</a><br /><br />I don't deny that Hemione is super clever, but is she really THAT smart for figuring out Lupin is a werewolf? Given all of the clues that were handed out, a few of Lupin's students should have guessed what he was. Considering so many of them saw what the boggert turned into. Did all of them REALLY thing it was just a white glowing ball he's afraid of?<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=broo-parce-1_zpseac6bb30.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/broo-parce-1_zpseac6bb30.gif\" /></a></center><br />Speaking of Lupin as a werewolf, I mentioned <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/nasty-temper-hes-got-that-sirius-black\">in my last post</a> I had a problem with Lupin's name. I didn't think the history about Lupin becoming a werewolf came out until the 5th book, but it looks like it's here. Therefore, here is my problem:<br />Remus Lupin says he was bit by a werewolf as a young child. Yet his name has two wolf references in it: Remus one of the twins that founded Rome, raised by a she-wolf and Lupin or \"Lupine\" which is relating to a wolf. That is either a) insanely coincidental, b) Lupin changed his name at some point (perhaps to give people some warning of what he is) or c) he was actually born a werewolf and this is actually a family thing. Or most likely, Rowling named him this because it's a clever little play on words and assumed no one was going to look this closely at a children's book. Silly Rowling.<br /><br />\"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\" Snape is TOTALLY fine with this. Which is why he's a pretty big asshole. But then (at least in the movie) he makes sure to push Harry, Ron, and Hermione behind him so he's between them and werewolf Lupin, and it makes up for some of his asshole behavior. Some.<br /><br />This is totally a <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_19667_6-horrifying-implications-harry-potter-universe_p2.html\">Cracked point</a>, but I think it should be made cos, ew. So Pettigrew was Scabbers and has been hanging out with the Weasley family for 12 years. First he was Percy rat, then later he was given to Ron. On the Marauder's Map, it doesn't matter if he's hidden as a rat, he still shows up as himself. And the twins had that map for awhile before giving it to Harry. So if they were to look at that map to see what their brother is up to, they'd see him sleeping with a man named Peter Pettigrew. So yeah, wtf?<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_inline_mi33sejrwY1qz4rgp_zps83f9f592.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mi33sejrwY1qz4rgp_zps83f9f592.gif\" /></a></center><br />\"You're the only person who has the right to decide [what to do with Pettigrew], Harry.\" What? Why? Why is Harry the only one who has the right to decide? Sirius has a pretty good right to decide, considering he lost his best friend AND has been in Azkaban for 12 years because of it. Gives him at least some right to decide.<br /><br />I'm not going to go on about the Time Turner because there are so many problems with it there is no way to go over all of them. Time travel in general doesn't work if you think about it too hard. Including the fact that in order for Hermione to get the Time Turner McGonagall had to get permission from the Ministry to get it for her, so there's a good chance Fudge would know she had it.<br /><br />Sirius is innocent and free (although still on the run), Lupin is sadly no longer their DADA professor, and Harry will be going back to the Dursley's for the summer.

I go in regularly for work, but I never get to just hang out. After lunch we wandered over to The Strand because, I mean, it's right there. I was looking for a Butler book (specifically Fledgling) but no one seems to appreciate how awesome she is, so the only copy they had was Kindred. Boyfriend+ noticed a copy of The Silver Linings Playbook and, <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/01/my-currently-reading-pile-will-be-added.html\">remembering Alice raving about it</a>, I decided I should give it a try. We decided it was too cold to keep wandering around so we ended up going to a movie. And what movie did we decide to see? Silver Linings Playbook, obviously. Normally I like to read the book first, but it's not that big of a deal to me.<br /><br />I really liked the movie. It's excellent, JLaw is excellent, and even Bradly Cooper (who I'm very meh about) is excellent. Because I enjoyed the movie so much and read the book not long after, I can't separate my review of the book and the movie. They're similar enough that it's obviously the same story, but different enough I can see how the movie was heavily adapted from the book. The characters are different in the movie, which means they react differently to things than they do in the book. And (I'm sorry Alice) but I preferred the movie.<br /><br />I don't know if I preferred the movie BECAUSE I saw it first or because it's better. Unless I get a case of soap opera amnesia and decide instead of trying to get my memory back I should read The Silver Linings Playbook I'm never going to know for sure. Just keep this in mind as I go through the review.<br /><br />So. The book is a man named Pat Peoples who's been in a mental health facility for some time, but has recently been released to his parents. While in \"the bad place\" he came up with the theory that his life is a movie and part of the movie means he has to improve himself (physically, mentally, emotionally) so he can reunite with his estranged wife. As soon as \"apart time\" is over and he returns to Nikki, he can get his happy ending. But when he's home no one will talk to him about Nikki. All of their wedding pictures are missing and his mother told him they were stolen because the frames were so nice. (All of the other pictures are still there because they were able to be replaced. Not the wedding photos though.) His father will hardly speak to him, not even when they're watching the Eagles play. He has his brother Jake and his best friend Ronnie talk to him, although not about Nikki or how long he was at the hospital. There's also his therapist and fellow Eagles fan Cliff. And Tiffany, Ronnie's sister-in-law. Tiffany is having her own problems after her husband's death and is scouting Pat for...something.<br /><br />The book is funny and sweet and charming and bittersweet. Pat is back home and trying to make sense of his world and of course, get his happy ending. But he was in \"the bad place\" for a reason, even if he can't remember why. This isn't to say he doesn't deserve a happy endings, he is a good guy, but it means the journey is going to be difficult. And Tiffany complicates things.<br /><br />Pat has no desire to be set up with anyone. He's still married and his happy ending involves him getting back with Nikki. Not that Tiffany seems to want him. She follows him on his jogs (even when he yells at her to leave) but she hardly speaks to him.<br /><br />The biggest reason I preferred the movie to the book is Pat. In the book, he's simple. As I mentioned above, he refers to the mental health facility as \"the bad place\" and the fact that he isn't allowed to contact Nikki as \"apart time\". He orders a bowl of cereal at a diner, pays for it with 2 $20s, and tells the waitress to keep the change, because Nikki liked big tippers. He (at least initially) believes his mother's story about his wedding photos being stolen. I prefer the movie version of Pat, who is just as optimistic as book Pat not as simple. He's just as certain he and Nikki will end up together, but he doesn't refer to their current separation as \"apart time\". He says whatever comes into his head, appropriate or not, but he knows he shouldn't. Movie Pat has mental health problems he deserved to spend time in the mental health facility, but that doesn't mean he's slow.<br /><br />I liked the book. But I preferred the movie. And because I saw/read them so close to one another, I couldn't help comparing the book to the movie the whole time I was reading it. Perhaps I'll give the book a try in a few years, when the memory of the movie has faded and see what I think. Of course I may end up buying a copy of the movie, so perhaps that will always be my definitive version.<br /><br />Title quote from page 15<br /><br />Quick, Matthew. The Silver Linings Playbook.

OK, so no cake, no pie, no fruit tart?<br />Boyfriend+: Let's be honest, I can throw any dessert in your face.<br /><br />So if you're wondering how wedding planning is going, it's pretty much like that. That's mean cos it makes it seem like I'm TRYING to do stuff and Boyfriend+ is just not doing anything. Which isn't true cos I'm not trying that hard to come up with stuff either. I should probably work on that. Plus he may have found a photographer, so he may have actually gotten more done with the whole wedding thing than I have.<br /><br />Oh and desserts are in no way figured out.

Once that's settled on we can actually start booking stuff. Venues and food cost ALL THE MONEY.

Plus it worked out nicely that he didn't get in trouble for it. See, there are POSITIVE side effects to an Azkaban escapee searching for you.<br /><br />Finally the wizarding community decided to forgive Hagrid and make him a teacher. I mean, it would have been nice of them if they had forgiven Hagrid after it became clear Tom Riddle = Voldemort and thus Hagrid didn't set the basilisk loose. But I think it's clear the wizarding world has a terrible legal system.<br /><br />Speaking of the wizard legal system, they are not focused on rehabilitation at all with their prison system. And considering they sent a small child to Azkaban because they thought he opened the Chamber of Secrets (on the word of another child instead of any sort of investigation) so I guess this really shouldn't be a surprise.  Rowling did create a supremely creepy creature in the Dementors. And I like that chocolate helps with the after effects. Because mmmmmm chocolate.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m1mf2royNr1r2mc4o_zpsb9f48035.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m1mf2royNr1r2mc4o_zpsb9f48035.gif\" /></a></center>I know it was a bad thing for Buckbeak to attack Malfoy, but man, don't you kinda wish he took off his whole arm or something? Maybe just a finger. Also Malfoy's threat about his dad going to the school governors seems empty. You know, given Lucius was kicked off the board for blackmail and intimidation.<br /><br />Lupin is great (even if I have problems with his name, which will be dealt with at a later time). It's nice to see an actually competent teacher. I know there are a few at the school, but they seem in equal number to the useless ones. Even if I like the useless ones. Like Trelawney. I mostly like Trelawney because of Emma Thompson and for her banter with McGonagall.<br /><br />The Marauder's Map is super creepy. Awesome if you're the one that has it and creepy if you're anyone. Because it knows where you are at all times.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lor9kkGIxn1qhsi1bo1_500_zps39d6b8c2.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lor9kkGIxn1qhsi1bo1_500_zps39d6b8c2.gif\" /></a></center>Then there's the whole danger factor considering people want to get into the schools and maybe this isn't a good thing to have around.<br /><br />Concerning the Firebolt, Harry and Ron are dumbasses. They know Black was in the castle and they acknowledge he's coming for Harry. Yet he gets a VERY expensive broomstick and has no concerns over it. Teenagers are stupid and they need to stop yelling at Hermione.<br /><br />Also the idea that Dumbledore couldn't be the one that gave him the broomstick because that would be showing favoritism. Except that time he bent the rules to let him play on the house team. And gave him his first broomstick, which was top of the line at the time. But no, no favoritism. <br /><br />As with the other books, the second half is the best part so I can't wait until part II!<br /><br />Title quote from page 161<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

I left a comment on <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/12/christmas-shall-live-forever-in-my.html\">Alice's blog</a> mentioning how I got no books. I did not mean this as a \"Please take pity on me and SEND ME BOOKS\" but because she's awesome and had extra copies of The Wordy Shipmates she sent me a copy. She has extra copies because she bought a bunch when they were on sale. Sort of like a one-woman World Book Night which is a great idea and if I ever see a cheap stack of books I LOVE I will do the same.<br /><br />I'm not too familiar with Sarah Vowell. I've heard of her. Mostly her latest book Unfamiliar Fishes and her work on The Daily Show and Wikipedia tells me she also did the voice of Violet Parr in The Incredibles. But I've wanted to read something of hers and now I have. Huzzah.<br /><br />The Wordy Shipmates is about the Puritans that helped get this whole America dealy started. Not the Mayflower Pilgrims but the 1630 Arbella guys that founded Boston and Providence. She argues that John Cotton's farewell sermon, \"God's Promise To His Plantation,\" which pretty much says these Puritans are the next God's chosen people leads to this feeling of American exceptionalism that's still felt today. Though the modern examples are just a sentence here and there, so the focus is on the Puritans themselves.<br /><br />Vowell reminds me of an academic Bill Bryson. She has lines like \"The irony of informing nearly naked people in a wilderness setting about the story of naked Adam and Eve eating the fruit of knowledge and inventing the fashion industry is not lost on [Roger] Williams.\" And how can you not love that? The reading is slower than the Bryson stuff, but I think that's because she's more focused on the micro, this small time period, versus Bryson looking at the big picture. Thing of his A Short History of Nearly Everything which covers centuries of scientific history. Vowell's tone is funny but not as irreverent as Bryson's. Of course, reading could have also been slow because early American History isn't exactly my favorite subject. It's already an uphill battle.<br /><br />Despite that uphill battle I really liked the book. I liked the book and I want to read more of her. My favorite sections are when she talks about the Puritans massacre of the Pequot. This is obviously not a happy section of the book, but these were also the parts where Vowell made a more personal connection with the story. She is part Cherokee and these sections feel less like a class lecture than other parts. A very interesting class lecture, but class lecture nonetheless. These were also the parts where the argument about these Puritans being the next God's chosen people come across the strongest. God wanted these guys to settle the land and  so burning men, women, and children alive was pretty much what God wanted.<br /><br />So yeah, I want to read more Vowell. And she apparently retraced the Trail of Tears with her sister. If she wanted to write a book about that, though it would be super depressing, I'd still read it. In the meantime, I'll need to check out the stuff she's already written.<br /><br />Side note, I especially like the title quote, probably because it's the same as one from Dogma that Rufus the 13th Apostle/Chris Rock says. And if we can tie things back to Dogma, all the better.<br /><br />Update to include the Dogma quote<br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001674/\">Rufus</a>: He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, televangelism. But especially the factioning of all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always, built a belief structure on it. <br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000400/\">Bethany</a>: Having beliefs isn't good? <br /><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001674/\">Rufus</a>: I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier...  <br /><br />Title quote from page 1<br /><br />Vowell, Sarah. The Wordy Shipmates.

The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.\" AWWWWWWWW Ron.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_inline_mga1l0Vs7O1rq9ki3.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mga1l0Vs7O1rq9ki3.gif\" /></a></center>What was Hagrid hoping Harry and Ron would learn by following the spiders and meeting Aragog? I know if they hadn't, they wouldn't have found out that Hagrid didn't open the Chamber and that the girl died in the bathroom. Except did anyone really believe Hagrid opened the Chamber? No, so they learned the girl died in the bathroom. But was that what Hagrid was hoping would happen? Aragog would make an off handed remark about not going there? Actually I hope Hagrid's plan was for Harry and Ron to ride spiders into the school to take down the monster. That would have made no sense, but I think I would have enjoyed it.<br /><br />I'm torn about the ending. Did Lucius know what the diary was? Because Dumbledore seems to suggest that he did and this was all a plan to get Arthur Weasley fired, by having his daughter murder a bunch of students with a mythical beast. Which, if THAT'S what Lucius was planning to do with a piece of Voldemort's soul, that is overkill. But if Lucius didn't know what the diary actually was, what was he hoping would happen by sneaking it into Ginny's book? Maybe just have her be caught with a dark object? WHAT IS YOUR END GAME?<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_me44ichdOl1qc61fp.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_me44ichdOl1qc61fp.gif\" /></a></center>Can house elves not do laundry? Would that count as presenting them with clothes? And really, does the way Dobby was \"presented\" with clothes count, because he actually caught something Lucius was throwing away? This is a case where I think the movie did it better by having Lucius present Dobby with the sock hidden inside the book. So he didn't realize that he was presenting him with his freedom.<br /><br />OK, so I apparently have lots of questions after this one. But really, I'm just excited that we're up to Prisoner of Azkaban now.<br /><br />I really tried to find a clip of this from Conan since he says it pretty much any time he's referencing a nerd, but my cursory Googling failed to turn anything up.

I don't have a book to review at the moment. I'm still making my way through The Wordy Shipmates and my final Chamber of Secrets post won't be posted until Friday. Also I need to write it. And finish CoS. Regardless, I have no other planned posts for the week, but I want to write something.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Kindle.jpg\" />Back in June of 2010 I wrote a post about whether or not I should get a Kindle. And then I never posted it. Who knows why. But in it I stated that I wouldn't get the Kindle and if I did decide to get any sort of e-reader I'd go with the iPad (why get a unitasker?), but not until they made some updates. That Christmas I got a Kindle. And I love it. I love it for all of the reasons I started in that unpublished post. And here are those original reasons, with my current comments:<br /><br /><ul><li>I have all of my books in one place.  <span>I was apparently under the belief that if I got a Kindle I would have to get rid of all of my physical books. And that I guess I'd rebuy all of them as digital copies? I don't even...</span></li><li>When I go on vacation I don't have to worry about the extra weight from bringing a few different books.  <span>This is true, so long as I plan accordingly so I'm not in the middle of a physical book when I go on vacation. This usually does not work out.</span></li><li>I never have to worry about finishing a book in the middle of my commute and then having nothing to entertain myself with. <span>This sort of builds into my last point, because on more than one occasion I've been in need of a book in the middle of a trip and just bought something new. Because why just wait and read one of the books I have sitting at home?</span></li><li>It's certainly lighter weight and more portable than a big heavy hardback. <span>I am SO glad to have my Kindle when reading <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/the-constitutions-been-canceled-in-mill\">Under the Dome</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/can-man-still-be-brave-if-he-is-afraid\">A Game of Thrones</a>. I plan on keeping the rest of the Song of Fire and Ice series on my Kindle. If/when I get around to that.</span></li><li>I won't have to wait for new books to come out in their paperback form.  I'm still waiting for <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/apart-we-are-together\">Shades of Grey</a> in paperback, so I won't have to drag the hardback copy around with me. <span>I did buy the digital copy of this and it was awesome. I also bought a paperback copy when I saw it on sale cos shut up, that's why. I also want to make this clear that Shades of Grey is very different than Fifty Shades of Grey. I had some confusing conversations where I was talking about the Fforde book and they were not.</span></li><li>I can make notes in the margins with some versions.  (I know I could do this with a real book but while I don't mind getting a book that's been marked up, I won't do it myself.  I'm slightly neurotic when it comes to my books.) <span>I love being able to highlight and make stupid comments in the margines of my digital copies. I still won't do it in my physical ones.</span></li><li>It's easy to buy new books instantly.  Perhaps a little too easy <span>This is true. Though the majority of my digital impulse buys have been for the under $4 choices so at least I'm not going broke.</span></li></ul>So yeah, I'm a fan of my Kindle. I still read a bunch of actual books. Both of the books I'm reading now are physical books. And I just went to the bookstore and bought two more books. According to my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/december-2012-reading-wrap-up\">2012 stats</a>, 35% of the books I read were digital copies. I'm not sure why I believed getting an ereader was an all-or-nothing requirement. <br />I clearly didn't go with the iPad, though I've been playing with Boyfriend+'s and I have decided that why should he have all the fun? So I've been thinking of getting one of those, though I think I'll still use the Kindle for most of my reading. And my reasoning for that now is the same as it was in that other post: my eye doctor told me my eyes are getting messed up because of all the time spent staring at screens. I look at a computer all day for work, and then spend my time at home looking at my phone or watching TV. I like the Kindle screen and it doesn't cause the eye strain that the other backlit screens do. Of course I also said I wasn't going to get an ereader so I'm obviously full of shit and will probably end up reading most of my stuff on the iPad if/when I get it and my Kindle will be set aside.<br />Anyone have both a Kindle and an iPad or some other tablet? Do you use both of them?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:22+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:22+00:00","published_at":"2013-01-29T14:08:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e165dde2223b60000dd","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"kindle","slug":"kindle","url":"/articles/tags/kindle"},{"value":"e-reader","slug":"e-reader","url":"/articles/tags/e-reader"}]}]},{"id":"53224e165dde22fdcf0004bb","title":"Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts","slug":"harry-potter-must-not-go-back-to-hogwarts","url":"/articles/harry-potter-must-not-go-back-to-hogwarts","body":"It's Friday again so it's time for another <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2013/01/harry-potter-readalong-week-4-my.html\">Harry Potter readalong post</a>! HUZZAH. As with all of these posts, there will be spoilers so reader beware.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />So this week we finished up the first half of Chamber of Secrets which, full disclosure, is probably my least favorite of the series. It's certainly the one I forget about the most AND the one that didn't interest me enough to keep reading the series. I'm glad my friend convinced me to read the third book because I would have been happy stopping the series after this one.<br /><br />I was very plot-hole-pokey with my Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone posts, so I'm going to try and not do that so much this time.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_inline_mfxbduU2h91qcvlav.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_inline_mfxbduU2h91qcvlav.gif\" /></a></center>Even though, I would like to stress, that the plot holes did not diminish my love for the series. I really only noticed them because I love the series and therefore have spent waaaay too much time thinking these things over. It's probably not healthy.<br /><br />This does not mean I'm going to be able to put together a coherent post. This is still going to be a bunch of random thoughts. But they'll just be more positive.<br /><br />Any book in a series that isn't the first is going to have a bit of \"Last time on...\" and Chamber of Secrets is no exception. I hate these parts. I mean, I get they're necessary and I don't think it's bad that we get a little recap of what happened before, but I just finished SS and don't need a recap on the rules of Quidditch. Therefore, there was a bit of skimming through the first half.<br /><br />Gilderoy Lockhart is such a wonderful character. I mean no one I'd actually like to deal with but man is it fun to watch him turn every conversation over to himself. Even though I read the book before I saw the movie, I still can't help but picture Kenneth Branagh in the role. Way to be an egotistical oblivious ass. And I mean that with love.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_meiw12FZiz1r3zl0b.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_meiw12FZiz1r3zl0b.gif\" /></a></center>Cos come on, Harry's detention with Lockhart answering fan mail? Genius. Also nice to see that Hogwarts figured out that sending children into the Forbidden Forest is a bad idea. Especially when you consider flying a car to Hogwarts is a WAY worse offense than being out after dark.<br /><br />I'm a little confused about Ron's wand breaking. Not how it broke or why it's malfunctioning, but how do you get a new one? I mean, he needs to get a new one, right? But getting a wand seems like such a big deal and \"the wand chooses you\" and all that jazz. So isn't it a big deal when you get a wand? And doesn't that mean you can't just replace it with any other wand?<br /><br />Given Filch's reaction to seeing Harry read his Kwikspell letter, I get the feeling that being a non-magical person in the magical world is almost worse than Harry being a wizard while living with the Dursleys. Alright, no the Dursleys are worse, but still pretty awful. And very condescending.<br /><br />On top of the squib thing, I feel so bad for Filch. His poor cat, Mrs. Norris. Side question, why Mrs. Norris? Did Filch have a kitty wedding at some point? Where's Mr. Norris? Is Mrs. Norris a widow? And now I feel bad for Filch for another reason. Poor guy.<br />UPDATE: From <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Alice</a>, Mrs. Norris is named after a character in Mansfield Park. Though I have an easier time believing she's a widow cat than I do Filch is an Austen fan. <br /><br />Can't wait for part two. And more than that, I can't wait until we're finished with this book and can move onto the next. Cos out of all of them, this is my least favorite HP. Whomp.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to end this post so, Alley out!g<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m9lp23ljfc1qzwnn8.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m9lp23ljfc1qzwnn8.gif\" /></a></center>Please be prepared to see this gif again.

That was a long and stressful journey.<br /><br />I don't really mean to read so much King. It just sort of happens, usually because I find copies of his books on sale and go \"why not\". Besides, if I ever want a book that's going to suck me in, King is a good way to go. And he's written roughly 2 bazillion novels so there is a LOT to choose from. And Laura was kind enough to put together a list of King books I should read based on his other stuff that I like.<br /><br />The plot itself is very simple: one day a dome of some sort closes off the Maine (of course) town of Chester Mill from the rest of the world. No one knows what the dome is or where it came from but you can't get out and nothing can get in. And IMMEDIATELY shit starts to go wrong. Sort of Lord of the Flies mixed with a little An Inconvenient Truth.<br /><br />There are a TON of characters to keep track of. I really should have made a chart. Except the chart would have to have been constantly revised. But there weren't so many characters that I couldn't follow or didn't enjoy it. I liked having so many characters to watch and it really made sense when you consider it was an entire town of around 2,000 people trapped together. Some are more directly involved with the action but everyone in town is affected in some way.<br /><br />Big Jim Rennie is one of the best villains I can think of. He's intelligence, conniving, power-obsessed, narcissistic asshole. Every time he's around you know something bad is going to happen and the way he is able to manipulate people is disgusting and a bit impressive. The hero characters (Dale \"Barbie\" Barbara, Julia Shumway, Eric \"Rusty\" Everett) are all good and interesting people but it's not the same. There isn't really a lot of grey area with the characters. Sure, not all of them are as evil as big Jim, but for the most part all of the characters fall into one camp or the other. Which is fine and works with this story.<br /><br />I said the story is long and stressful, and it is. It's 1,092 pages, at least according to Goodreads. I read the thing on my Kindle so I'm not exactly sure how long it is, other than I'm really glad I was reading a digital copy instead of a physical one. And it's stressful because OMG there is so much that happens to our poor characters. And just when you think nothing else awful can happen to them you realize you have nother 500 pages to go and your heart sinks a little because you know things are just going to get worse before they can (hopefully? maybe? please?) start to get better.<br /><br />Here's my only problem with Under the Dome. I love the premise that there's this town completely cut off from everything but this dome. I love watching how the citizens react and how things start going downhill real fast. What I was less interested in was the dome itself and why it's there. And that's the problem. You can't just plunk down this dome and then have no explanation for it. That sucks. But if you DO explain it, then you spend time with the characters dealing with that instead of the craziness going on with the other people, and then I start to lose interest. I can't think of a way that this could have been remedied and still keep the dome so whomp.<br /><br />TL;DR? Good, but not GREAT King with excellent build up but a bit of a let down ending.<br /><br />There is apparently to be a TV mini-series adaptation of the book coming out this summer (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_The_Dome#Television_adaptation\">so sayeth Wikipedia</a>). If so I'll need to make sure to catch it. I know King adaptations can go very badly, but I still like to give them a try. Plus I liked the mini-series adaptation of The Shining so maybe that's the way to go with his stuff.<br /><br />Title quote from location 3440<br /><br />King, Stephen. Under the Dome.

New York City - Because I heart it here so why wouldn't I want to see more stories set here?<br /><br />2. Boston - Because I used to live there, and I like seeing stories where I know the geography.<br /><br />3. Italy - Because it's gorgeous there, and I was able to forgive a lot of problems with Angels and Demons based totally on the fact that it took place in Rome.<br /><br />4. Bookworld - Because Jasper Fforde created such a fun world that I never want to leave it. So please keep the Thursday Next books coming.<br /><br />5. Dystopian futures - Because I like seeing what could happen if things go very, very wrong in the present.<br /><br />6. Somewhere in Maine - Because this means that Stephen King has turned out more books.<br /><br />7. Seattle - NOT because of Twilight but because I heart that city.<br /><br />8. Shakespeare's plays - I don't think this counts but I'm already not going to make it to ten so I'm getting very loose with the definition of setting.

Because I am loving this and remembering how much I love them and I'm so excited to be reading these with everyone.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/AFADS.jpg\" /><br />I finished up enough of Pottermore to get my wand AND get sorted. Both processes were a little bit...meh. Not that I know what I was expecting. I think actual magic. But ANYWAY, I am in Ravenclaw.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lutgmvKGOX1qjp921.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lutgmvKGOX1qjp921.gif\" /></a></center>Where are the other eagles? (Even though we should totally be ravens cos it's RIGHT IN THE NAME and also ravens are way smarter than eagles. Those majestic bastards get everything.) Also my wand is 11 1/2 inches, hazel with dragon core and it's flexibility is unyielding. I'm not really sure what that means, other than the unyielding part, which I'm pretty sure means I'm stubborn. So. Yeah.<br /><br />Before I get into the post I just want to put the spoiler reminder. Cos this is going to just full of them. Also I thought by now I'd be able to form coherent thoughts about the book overall but NOPE, we're going with random bullets again. Maybe for Chamber.<br /><br />I love Dumbledore. Enough to overlook the fact that he is very lucky none of his students die on his watch cos he is CRAZY negligent. But he's so twinkly that I don't care. The scene with the Mirror of Erised. And the end after Harry has fought Quirell. THE BEST. So Twinkly.g<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lwrcucNVnt1r4zq3ao1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lwrcucNVnt1r4zq3ao1_500.gif\" /></a></center><br />I'm so happy Harry and Ron and Hermione are now best friends because those were some tough chapters when they weren't. Even if Hermione was was completely insufferable, still, DID NOT LIKE. Plus they calm her down.<br /><br />We finally learn about Quidditch, and I know I linked to this already, but I'm going to leave this Cracked article right here: <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/quidditch-is-bullshit/\">A Harry Potter Protest (aka Quidditch is Bullshit)</a>. Cos for serious? This sport does not work. Well it works to make Harry Potter the super hero and the rest of the team pointless which is not the purpose of team sports. Sorry Rowling. Awesome job creating a magical world, not-so-awesome job creating a new sport with rules that make sense.<br /><br />The Mirror of Erised chapter is so sad. Poor Harry when the only thing he wants is a family. Doesn't it make Ron's desires seem shallow. Especially the image of him sitting on the ground and just gazing into the mirror and watching his parents and distant relatives. SAD.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=ZqOBM.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/ZqOBM.gif\" /></a></center><br />So most of the time magic is awesome and way better than living in the real world. But there are a few things that I can't help think that if wizards would just embrace some Muggle technology, they could save themselves a lot of trouble. You know, like when it came to looking up Nicholas Flamel. I bet Harry, Ron, and Hermione would have LOVED Wikipedia to be available.<br /><br />I know this is a children's book and we NEED Harry and Ron and Hermione to be the heroes and get to the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone and save the day. But really? These great wizards and witches put together elaborate obstacles to keep the second most powerful wizard and his accomplices from the stone and 3 first year students are able to figure it out. Two of whom didn't even know wizards were a THING until like 8 months earlier. I mean, if this was an indication of the type of defenses the good side was going to put up against the evil one, we're screwed. (Yes I did put myself in their world.)<br /><br />One thing I was happy to see was that Voldemort didn't start hanging out on the back of Quirells head until AFTER Harry had already met him at the pub before heading to Diagon Alley. Therefore it makes sense that Harry's scar didn't hurt then. Plot hole closed. Plot hole opened, Harry doesn't mention his scar hurting every time he's in Quirell's class. Unless the scar only hurts when Voldemort is super pissed and during class time he was sort of just hanging out back there. Probably thinking the turban was smelly cos who would want to be cooped up there all the time, evil incarnate or not. Except he didn't have a nose so he's prob fine.<br /><br />AND NOW we can move onto Chamber because it has been super hard to not just pick it up and keep reading.<br /><br />I can't remember which one of you described him that way but it is the perfect description.

I'm also participating in Alice's <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/12/harry-potter-2013-readalong-signup-post.html\">Harry Potter Readalong ALL THE GIFS</a> and I finished Sorcerer's Stone but can't post about that until Friday. So what to do till then?<br /><br />I could talk about the announcement of the new Dan Brown novel but eh. He's not my favorite author by any stretch of the imagination but I may read this one cos about something something Dante's Inferno something something. And I read Da Vinci Code (cos really, who didn't?) and Angels and Demons. Neither of which were very good but then again, I also read Twilight and sometimes you need literary junk food.<br /><br />I could talk about my TBR list. I'm fairly confident I will never read anything on the list. Not because it's SO HUGE that it's unmanageable but because I add books to the list far faster than I read them. And then instead of picking a book off that list, I end up going with something else entirely. Cos that's how I roll.

THE EXCITEMENT<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=seinfelddance.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/seinfelddance.gif\" /></a></center>We're beginning this with the first 9 chapters of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone if you're not American and therefore, you don't get babied. Because apparently we are too stupid for any book that has \"Philosopher\" in the title.) And warning for everyone, there will be spoilers. And not just for those first 9 chapters. The whole series is fair game, though I'll try to only bring up spoilers when it's actually necessary for whatever ridiculous argument I'm trying to make. But this will mostly be made up of random thoughts.<br /><br />I love the opening sentence. \"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet drive, were proud to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.\" It's the \"thank you very much\" that does it. You can tell from that one sentence the stick up their collective ass is huge.<br /><br />I don't so much mind the exposition dump when Dumbledore and McGonagall are waiting for Hagrid to show up with Harry. I have much more of a problem with the fact that Dumbledore's device is called \"the Put-Outer\". That sounds like the name you give something as a stand-in while you come up with something better. Come on now, Rowling. <br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m7dadjxna61qh4r9a.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m7dadjxna61qh4r9a.gif\" /></a></center>The beginning spends a lot more time with the Dursleys than I remembered. But then again, I mostly remember the Dursleys as those few pages that happen at the beginning of the book before we get to Hogwarts and the magic. But that's cool cos I like those chapters. You gotta see how awful things are for Harry at home so he can be so excited and not-at-all homesick while at Hogwarts. Besides, I like the scene in the zoo with the snake. Although, how exactly was the snake planning on getting to Brazil? It's a bit of a ways away from England. I fear things don't end so happily for the snake.<br /><br />It seems like the only place for you to buy all of your Hogwarts supplies is at Diagon Alley. Does that mean all of those stores have a monopoly on spellbooks and wands and cauldrons? That said<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_me6am52Dge1ql5yr7o1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_me6am52Dge1ql5yr7o1_500.gif\" /></a></center>I love the scene at platform 9 3/4. Mostly because we get to meet the Weasleys and let's just admit that Mrs. Weasley is one of the best characters (and we can discuss how terrible the twins are later). Except I don't understand. Why doesn't the letter tell you how to get to platform 9 3/4? We've established kids born to Muggles get these letters so why should we assume they know what they're doing.<br /><br />Why is Ravenclaw's mascot an eagle? Not a raven? No? Is there a clever reason behind that?<br /><br />Man, Hermione is insufferable early on. I mean, more than normal 11 year olds. I don't like her not being friends with Ron and Harry, but I'm actually more surprised they all ended up besties. It just goes to show how awesome she is that her good qualities out weigh her know-it-all-ness. But I mean, someone has to have all of the answers throughout the series.<br /><br />Here's something that randomly bugs me about the series, even though it's totally just me thinking WAY TOO HARD into this series and I should really just accept that it's a children's series. So the Dursleys HATE Harry and treat him like dirt and make him sleep under the stairs with the spiders. They've been his guardians since he was 1. And yet Harry is amazingly well adjusted. I keep thinking \"Harry, wouldn't you be more of a sociopath? How are you able to form bonds with people if you had been completely neglected through your formative years? Rowling, why haven't you done extensive research into childhood psychology to answer these questions?\" I know. I need help.<br /><br />I was going to find my Hogwarts house by going through Pottermore and I made the username and everything and now it's telling me I need to go through chapters before I can get sorted. So what I'm saying is I haven't been sorted yet. Perhaps before the end of this readalong I'll get my house figured out. But I have really important places to be in the meantime<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_mdb93tMBZx1qgcra2o2_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_mdb93tMBZx1qgcra2o2_500.gif\" /></a></center><br /><br />Title quote from page 50<br /><br />Rowling, J.K.

Mostly because she kicks ass. I mean she was a black, female sci-fi author, with her first books published in '76. Look at all the shit <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-most-ridiculous-things-about-calling-out-fake-fangirls/\">\"fake geek girls\"</a> get now for daring to hang out in a space typically reserved for white males. It's a nice bonus that makes my author stats look better. So whenever I went to my local bookstore I would browse the stacks to see if they had any of her books, especially Fledgling. For whatever reason, her books are hard to find. Or at least they're not regularly kept in stock at bookstores. In any case, there was only 1 Butler book, Parable of the Sower. The summary looked interesting (\"unattended environmental &amp; economic crises lead to social chaos\", \"night of fire and death\", \"flight for survival\", \"birth of a new faith\") but the copy was a little batteredg and I always found an excuse to put the book back. Yes, \"always\" because each time I went to the store, the same copy was sitting on the shelf. Eventually it tugged at my heartstrings enough that I HAD to bring it home. And once again, Butler does not disappoint.<br /><br />Parable of the Sower starts in 2024 in a dystopian world where the US has been plunged into what seems to be the Great Depression to the nth degree. The main character, Lauren Olamina, is born into this world and while her father remembers the world as it was, we never get a clear idea what happened to cause this chaos. There's ecological disaster (it hardly rains anymore), extreme poverty (a few companies have managed to set up situations where indentured servitude is a pretty good deal), and rampant drug abuse (in the form of a new drug that makes people set fire to EVERYTHING). So yeah, not a fun place.<br /><br />Long before the book starts, Lauren has been keeping a journal she calls Earthseed: The Books of the Living as sort of an understanding of her world through a new understanding of God, which I know I just made sound pretentious or preachy but it's not. The book itself is made up of Lauren's journals, but only a sentence or two at the beginning of each chapter is from Earthseed. The rest is her talking about her life, her family, and once her home is destroyed, her travels as she and her band of survivors try to make it out in the world. How can humanity survive in such chaos?<br /><br />My favorite thing about Butler is she creates some of the strongest female characters AND she realizes that \"strong female character\" doesn't equal \"like a dude, but with boobs\". Lauren is smart, a leader, tough but vulnerable. Actually vulnerable. Lauren has something called \"hyperempathy\" which means if she sees or hears anyone else in pain, she feels their pain. It can get to the point that she will start bleeding if she sees someone else bleed. A world where it's every man for himself and you better be prepared to defend yourself (with lethal force if necessary) this condition is a bit of a handicap.<br /><br />Parable was supposed to be a trilogy but Butler only managed the second book, Parable of the Talents, before writer's block and then a case of \"death\" kept her from writing the final book.<br /><br />While this isn't my favorite Butler book it's still an excellent book and if you guys still have yet to read any Butler, you should really fix that. Cos seriously, she kicks ass.<br /><br />Oh hey, look, I've already completed one of my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2013/reading-goals-for-2013\">2013 reading goals</a>. Success!<br /><br />I always try to find the MOST PERFECT copy of any book. I'll grab the bottom book in a stack cos that is the copy least likely to have any folded edges.<br />Damn you Brave Little Toaster!!<br /><br />Title quote from page 3<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E.

Because it's an amazing show and if you haven't seen it yet, you should probably drop what you're doing and go binge watch. It's hilarious and touching and complicated and OMG I LOVE IT. So reading the book that inspired it seemed like a natural choice. Especially when said book was on sale.\r\n\r\n![Orange is the New Black cover](/assets/Orange is the New Black cover.JPG) \r\n\r\nThe original Orange is the New Black is a memoir by Piper Kerman, as WASP from a good New England family who, in her early twenties Piper dated a woman who dealt heroin for some guy in West Africa. She didn't deal heroin in the \"stand on a street corner\" kind of way, but instead the way that let her jet set to exotic locations and have lots of disposable income. Piper laundered money for the operation one time and ten years later found herself serving a 15 month sentence at a minimum security prison. Piper's memoir details what she learned about herself, about the other women she was incarcerated with, and about the American prison system. Things about herself and other women: pretty good. The prison system:...yeah, not so much.\r\n\r\nLaura pointed this out in her review that Kerman does an excellent job talking about all of the problems with the prison system without smacking you over the head with them. She's so right. Kerman points out things that are messed up in the prison system, be it conditions or who is predominantly being arrested, without preaching. And they're woven within the story itself so they never get eye-rolly. And some of the stuff is terrible and unfair\r\n\r\n> \"A female prisoner who alleges sexual misconduct on the part of a guard is invariably locked in the SHU [solitary confinement] in 'protective custody,' losing her housing assignment, program activities (if there are any), work assignment, and a host of other prison privileges, not to mention the comfort of her routine and friends.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of funny moments that come from the ridiculousness of the situation.\r\n\r\n> \"Nice veins!\" [the prison doctor] said with very genuine admiration. \"No track marks!\" Given his total lack of irony, I thanked him.\r\n\r\nReading this made me want to watch the show all over again. It's different enough that you shouldn't expect to read the same thing as the show, but there are enough moments and characters that are the same or at least similar enough to make me go \"TAYSTEE I MISS YOU\".\r\n\r\nI know there are complaints that the book only focuses on Piper's experience so you're only seeing prison through the eyes of a white upper-middle-class woman. Those people are dumbasses. You've picked up a memoir by a white upper-middle-class woman. The hell did you think it was going to be about? I know the show branches out more and that is AWESOME and a big plus for the show. But really, why did you think Piper's memoir would also include memoirs from other ladies?\r\n\r\nPiper does come off a bit like her shit smells like flowers, but not enough that I was mad at her for it. I mean I assume when it comes to memoirs most people are painting themselves with some pretty rose colored glasses. I would. Again, another way I appreciate that the TV show, since it's not Piper's memoirs, can branch out from this, but I really don't think it's something to hold against the book.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the book. It's one I could see my re-reading. However, the show is still better. Just don't go into the book expecting to get the same experience as the show. Which is probably good advice in general when seeing a story in multiple media.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:29:08+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:38:57+00:00","published_at":"2013-01-08T15:06:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd6745dde22aa760001b6","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 107, location 1690 | Kerman, Piper.

Or any type of resolution. Because, you know<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/C&amp;H+resolution.jpg\" />But this week's <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2013/01/paulas-top-ten-reading-goals-for-2013.html\">Tuesday Top Ten (hosted by The Broke and The Bookish)</a> asked what your reading goals are for the new year and I figured I'd try to come up with some.g So in no particular order, some reading goals<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-3.jpg\" /><br />1. Read more ladies - I don't think making sure I read a diverse collection of authors is the MOST important thing because the story itself is the most important thing. That said, I need to read less guys. Not that male authors are BAD but perhaps get a different point of view every once in awhile.<br /><br />2. Read more non-white people - Ditto for some racial diversity in my authors.<br /><br />3. Read more non-US authors - Also some authors from somewhere other than my home country. And yes, I COULD have just said read less white guys from America but that would have been 1 goal instead of 3.<br /><br />4. Go to more author signings - I don't have any in mind or have any idea when authors I heart have books coming out and thus will be doing a book tour, but the 2 I went to last year were so fun I WANT MORE. Goal 4b is be less awkward at said book signing. I didn't make this a separate goal because I'm pretty sure it has no chance of happening. But I thought I should mention it.<br /><br />5. Get my review of The Parable of the Sower just written already - It's been awhile now. And it's not that I don't WANT to review it. I'm just lazy with reviews.<br /><br />6. Finish the Harry Potter readalong - I'm confident I'm going to accomplish this goal, but I want something on this list I know I'll be able to check off. Man, I really hope I didn't just jinx myself.<br /><br />7. Do a better job answering review requests - I'm not trying to make this a humble brag cos I really don't get that many review requests. Which really just makes it all the worse that I have a tendency to just not answer most of the requests I get. Which is rude and I need to answer people, even if it's just to say \"thanks but no thanks\".<br /><br />8. Read The Corrections - This has sorta been a goal for years now. Which is stupid. This book needs to stop mocking me. I CAN DEFEAT YOU, FRANZEN.<br /><br />9. Listen to more audiobooks - preferably while running (or at least walking) since that was something I was PLANNING on doing when I got all of the HP audiobooks<br /><br />10. Do a better job reading the newspaper - I know this isn't quite the \"reading goal\" TB&amp;TB people were asking about (I assume, anyway) but we get the NYT delivered each weekend and I pretty much read: the magazine (especially Chuck Klosterman as The Ethicist column), the Real Estate section, and the Book Reviews. I only randomly pick up the other sections, and I should really make an effort to have an idea of what's going on in the world. I cannot get all of my current event knowledge from Twitter.<br /><br />So, what are your reading goals for the year?<br /><br />Did you also figure out which goal is a the reason I decided to write this post instead of working on another one? Yeah. I'm starting off my goals by putting them off.

So I decided to go with The Shining because apparently I want to make sure if I'm reading two things at once, they need to be at opposite ends of the spectrum. Also I would like to read Doctor Sleep at some point and I'm pretty sure The Shining was on sale.\r\n\r\nLast time I read this book I was around 14. I lent my book to someone else who never returned it, and I haven't re-read it since. Also if you're wondering why I'm all nervous lending books out, this. This is why.\r\n\r\nI remembered the basic story, I remembered it was different than the movie, and I remembered that Joey from Friends would put the book in the freezer when he wasn't reading it.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that perhaps don't know the story, Jack Torrence has recently accepted a position as caretaker at the Overlook Hotel for the winter. The hotel is only open in the spring and summer because the winter weather makes the mountain passes...well, unpassable. And the phone lines go out as well. Someone needs to hang out at the TOTALLY ISOLATED hotel and make sure things are still in good condition come next spring, and in this case that someone is Jack, his wife Wendy and young son Danny.\r\n\r\nJack's had trouble with alcohol and his temper in the past, so this is a last chance to start his life fresh. He'll take the time to work on his play, his friend will see if he can smooth things over at the school he used to work at, and really, the family needs the money. But there's something not right about the hotel. Halloran, the hotel cook, recognizes Danny's ability to \"shine,\" to read minds a bit and to be able to see events, sometimes in the future, sometimes in the past. He warns Danny that the hotel may show him things that are scary but they're just pictures. But what if they're something more? \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere at the Overlook is what's so great. It's so scary and tense, but it builds slowly. The family gets up to the hotel and things start to go wrong, but it's not enough to scare them away. Which is a thing I forgot about and makes everything so much worse. I forgot how much of the book takes place when the family could have left the hotel. They go up to the Overlook early in the book, but it's not like they immediately get snowed in. They regularly go into town and go to the library and the little shop. They had a chance to get away, all three of them, before the hotel takes control. And of course they don't. I hope that isn't a spoiler for you, but really, if they did get away before things got really bad then clearly there wouldn't be a story.\r\n\r\nThis is a seriously scary book. The tension slowly mounts until you (and the Torrence's) are about to snap. And then they do.\r\n\r\nThe book is so much more than just a haunted hotel story. The main story, the main conflict, is Jack against himself. The hotel may have its demons, but the ones within Jack are just as scary and just as much of a threat to the family. That's the part the movie missed. I still like the Kubrick movie, but the book is so much scarier. Which is too bad cos you'd think Kubrick would have made use of all of the really creepy things going on instead of just deciding Nicholson is crazy, that'll do. And while I heart his performance, it's not Jack Torrence. The whole thing with Jack is the change he goes through to become the monster he is by the end, the monster he'd been trying to keep under control. Nicholson's Jack was crazy from the beginning, and you never got the feeling that he was anything other than this murderous psychopath. He was jut playacting that he was something different. Really during that first interview they should have known how having him as caretaker was going to play out.\r\n\r\nEven if you're not a King fan, you should read this book. If you're not a horror fan, you should probably stay away because Joey hiding the book in the freezer isn't a bad idea. \r\n\r\n`1` My reviews are really far behind. I didn't realize just how backlogged I am until I started to write this one and realized I read this over Thanksgiving. So yeah. There you go.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-22T18:26:30+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-22T19:39:52+00:00","published_at":"2013-01-06T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"5313b5405dde2224830001dc","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[{"id":"532dd5d65dde2289f600005c","key":"citation","value":"Title quote from page 332, location 5825 | King, Stephen.

Is it joining in a <a href=\"http://readingthebricks.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-gif-admiration-society-presents.html\">mini-readathon</a>? Cos it should be.<br /><br />Because this is a mini-readathon it's only 8 hours AND there is a mini-theme. Which in my case is going to be try to figure out any possible reason (no matter how convoluted) that the book I'm reading or the snack I'm eating count as mini. Because I couldn't be botheredg to actually pick up mini-foods, even though we spent so much time coming up with good options.<br /><br />There's a check-in around hour 4 and then a wrap-up post and I'll probably post updates whenever I need a break from reading/more snacks. FIRST UP<br /><br />Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson<br />Clementines, which are kinda like tiny oranges<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/MR1.jpg\" />I'm actually prepared with this post because I woke up around 9:50 thinking the readalong started at 10. I figured screw it, I'll start late and then realized no one else had posts up. At which point I actually double checked the time and realized I had an hour. See, sometimes my inability to pay attention to details (like the clock) works in my advantage.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bryson is still guiding me around England, but I decided I needed more food. So snack number 2, mini-grilled cheeses<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/MR2.jpg\" />What's that? You say it's just a normal size grilled cheese but cut down to smaller pieces and served on toothpicks? Quiet you.<br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: While I am enjoying Bryson's trip around England, I need something else. I considered switching to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (mini because written for children, aka mini-people) because all the cool kids are doing it, but I think I'm going to go with The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [abridged] by the Reduced Shakespeare Company. I've read/watched this enough that I sort of have it memorized (and I've destroyed my original paperback and VHS copy in the process) so this should be a quick one. I also need more food so this time it's apples and peanut butter, which is mini because it is a snack generally enjoyed by children, which we've already decided are mini-people.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/MR3.jpg\" /><br />MORE UPDATES: Just finished The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [abridged] so that with the Bryson I've thus far read puts me at 287 pages read. Woo! I'm going back to Bryson but before that MORE SNACKS<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/MR6.jpg\" /><br />I forgot that I just happened to have mini Toblerones sitting around. How convenient. And I decided it's time for a cocktail and I just happened to have a tiny bottle of Maker's hanging around.<br /><br />WRAP UP: I'm in the same place I was after the last update. I had good intentions to get more reading done but I decided to just see what's going on on TV. And VH1 is doing a countdown of top songs of the 2000s which I JUST WATCHED but apparently I can't look away. So I got another 4 pages read. Oh well.<br /><br />Total pages read: 291<br />Books read: <br />1/2 of Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson<br />The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [abridged] by the Reduced Shakespeare Company<br />Snacks consumed: <br />Clementines<br />Tiny grilled cheeses<br />Apples &amp; PB<br />Mini Toblerone<br />Whiskey &amp; cola made with a teeny bottle of Maker's<br /><br />Good times, everyone. Good times.<br /><br />This is only kind of true. Another part of the \"couldn't be bothered\" is due to the fact that we have 1 car between Boyfriend+ and I, and he usually has it. Cos it's his and all. So if I want to pick up food I need to a) do it when I'm in NYC and drag it back to LI with me b) get the car from Boyfriend+ when he's home from work c) go with Boyfriend+. C is pretty much the only one that happens, since he works often and I hate driving. We haven't had time to go grocery shopping but DON'T WORRY. I will come up with foods.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:25+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:25+00:00","published_at":"2013-01-05T16:03:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e195dde22fdcf0004c2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"mini things","slug":"mini-things","url":"/articles/tags/mini-things"},{"value":"Readathon","slug":"readathon","url":"/articles/tags/readathon"}]}]},{"id":"53224e195dde22fdcf0004c3","title":"Harry Potter readalong - IT BEGINS","slug":"harry-potter-readalong-it-begins","url":"/articles/harry-potter-readalong-it-begins","body":"<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/HP+Readalong.jpg\" /><a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/12/harry-potter-2013-readalong-signup-post.html\">Alice's Harry Potter readalong</a> is here you guys! Are you excited? OF COURSE YOU ARE.<br /><br />Since I'm not too sure what we're supposed to be saying for this first post, I'm going to go on about my intro to Harry Potter. I know I've talked about this here before, but I'm going to do it again. That's what happens when the blog is mine.<br /><br />So Harry Potter came out when I was in middle school which SHOULD have put me right in the prime audience. Except I was switching back and forth between reading Victor Hugo (and not understanding any of it) and reading Stephen King and apparently couldn't be bothered with something like a boy wizard. That's only sort of true because even though this was a PHENOMENON I don't remember hearing too much about it other than, there's a book series that is \"bringing reading back\" or whatever language used.<br /><br />So it was several years after the books first came out that I started them. I was studying in Italy and brought a couple books with me that were laying around the house. My brother had a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (never read by him) so I threw that in my suitcase and when I was out of other English language books, I gave it a try. And I liked it. When I was in Rome I found an English language copy of the second book and decided to read that as well. And then I stopped reading the books for a couple more years, because why would I stick with anything?g<br /><br />The final book came out the summer after I graduated college and a friend of mine was SUPER excited for it. Not only that, but she wanted to spread the HP love with me when she realized I read the first two books and no more. So one day she, Boyfriend+, and I went to the beach. She was reading her brand new copy of the 7th book and she lent me a copy of the 3rd book so I could catch up and get to the 7th book and then we could talk about it. Good news was I got super into the 3rd book (SIRIUS!). The bad news is I am very pale and 70+SPF sunscreen reapplied twice is not enough to keep me from setting on fire. The kind of good news (though doesn't make up for the massive sunburn) is that I didn't do much while recovering from this burn other than lay on my stomach and silently weep.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_mfyw05GOeI1s248avo1_400.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_mfyw05GOeI1s248avo1_400.gif\" /></a></center>But it gave me plenty of time to finish the 3rd book and start on the 4th one (my brother's other HP book, again never read by him).<br /><br />At the end of the summer my beach friend, Boyfriend+, and I moved in together which meant I now had access to the rest of the books and it didn't take me too much longer to finish the series. And that is my HP journey. I've re-read the first couple book since but never made it past the fourth one. Not for any reason other than I'm easily distracted. I have listened to the audiobooks a couple times so I've semi-re-read them. But I am EXTRA SUPER EXCITED for this readalong so we can all read them and talk about them and pick sides and the gifs. THE GIFS.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_meshld6BGd1rao0jp.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_meshld6BGd1rao0jp.gif\" /></a></center>And now because I heart Cracked and over-analyzing pop culture (which is what this HP readalong is about right? That and the GIFs?) so here are a bunch of articles about HP that I will probably quote a few times during this readalong.

If you don't, happy Wednesday on a day when I bet a lot of people still aren't around. Here's what I've been up to the last few days:<br /><br />So Boyfriend+ and I hosted not one but two Christmases because we're nuts. My family came over for Christmas Eve, his family  Christmas Day. What, we could have had all of the family together at once? First up, we were sort of busting at the seams with Boyfriend+'s family, so adding more people would have meant a lot of people eating on whatever plate-like-object I could find and also probably sitting on the floor. Plus my mom just met his dad this past Sunday even though he and I have been together for 8 years, cos we take our time. Apparently.<br /><br />Since I spent so much time in the kitchen, here's what we made<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/xmas+spread.jpg\" />Menu for Christmas Eve!<br />For lunch: veggie pizza<br />For apps: baked brie, bean dip, bacon wrapped cheese stuffed dates + this white cranberry cosmo thing that is fantastic and I will probably continue to drink those until we're out of cranberry vodka.<br />For dinner: seafood paella (with shrimp, scallops, lobster, mussels, salmon)<br />For dessert: cookies, so many cupcakes that we picked up that afternoon <br /><br />Menu for Christmas!<br />For apps: guac &amp; chips, bacon wrapped cheese stuffed dates, caprese salad skewers (fresh moz, tomato, basil on a toothpick)<br />For lunch/dinner: bacon mac &amp; cheese, apple &amp; cherry stuffed chicken breasts, grilled salmon, sauteed spinach, steamed broccoli, white rice<br />For dessert: more cookies, rugelach, cheesecake, coconut custard pie, blueberry pie, ice cream<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Lion+King+broadway.jpg\" />I mentioned that my family and Boyfriend+'s met on Sunday, which was a last minute thing. My mom, aunt, and I went to see The Lion King on Broadway. The costumes and sets for it were insane. So good. The rest of it was eh, but the costumes/sets made up for it. Anyway, after the show we all ended up meeting for dinner, which worked out nicely.<br /><br />Boyfriend+ and I went out last night to see the new Les Mis movie. So if you could all go see it so we could talk about it, that'd be neat. Some quick thoughts:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Les+Mis+poster.jpg\" />Anne Hathaway was really good as Fantine. I understand the Oscar buzz.<br />I didn't have too much hope for Russel Crowe as Javert. He was better than I expected. But not as good as I wanted him to be, so whomp.<br />Amanda Seyfried as Cosette and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were both surprisingly good. I don't usually like adult Cosette cos she's so flighty and annoying but I liked her here. And I heard somewhere Redmayne wasn't great as Marius but now I can't remember where I heard that so I could have made it up. ALSO Redmayne has a lot of freckles so (having them myself) he got extra points.<br />Overall I wasn't totally blown away with the movie but I did have pretty high expectations. I also have a good amount of the music memorized, so, yeah.<br /><br />From the audience I saw the movie with<br />There was a lady behind me that made SO MUCH NOISE during the movie. Not really talking but loud gasps every time Javert showed up on screen. And he is a main character and all so that happened a lot. At one point I wanted to turn around and tell her the rest of the plot. The story is 150 years old so I feel I'm safe from spoilers at this point.<br />I guess she was also a big Sacha Baron Cohen fan cos when he showed up on the screen, before doing anything other than standing there, she was cracking up. <br />The two people sitting next to us got up and left about 20 minutes in. I don't think they knew there would be singing...<br />A person on the other side, near the end, said \"Well, this movie sure is depressing, isn't it?\" While I understand the title is technically in French, I'm pretty sure you can see \"Miserable\" right there, so you should probably assume this won't be a sunshine filled jaunt through wildflower fields. Adjust your expectations accordingly.<br /><br />Why yes, I am listening to Les Mis now. How'd you guess?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:27+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:27+00:00","published_at":"2012-12-26T14:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e1b5dde2223b60000e1","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Lion King","slug":"lion-king","url":"/articles/tags/lion-king"},{"value":"Les Mis","slug":"les-mis","url":"/articles/tags/les-mis"},{"value":"Chrismahanakwanzaakah","slug":"chrismahanakwanzaakah","url":"/articles/tags/chrismahanakwanzaakah"}]}]},{"id":"53224e1b5dde2223b60000e2","title":"Dane pined for change","slug":"dane-pined-for-change","url":"/articles/dane-pined-for-change","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Ad+Nomad+cover.jpg\" />This review is going to be disjointed. I'd try to put together a summary to really pull everything together, but I read this book over a long period of time and in between I wrote down thoughts here as I went. So yeah, fair warning (both in the structure of this AND that this book took me forever, which isn't a great sign.) <br /><br />Ad Nomad by Eric Jay Sonnenschein is the story of Dane Bacchus, a college writing professor who, upon losing his job as a professor, decides to go into advertising. He goes from agency to agency writing copy for pharmaceutical companies. There are late nights and fights with co-workers and every once in awhile an ad gets made.<br /><br />I went back and forth on this one. Because at first I really enjoyed it. I was a bit hesitant after The Mine but I was liking this. The writing kept me entertained and I wanted to see what would happen. And then I saw what happened. And then it happened again. And again. And again. For 600 pages.<br /><br />One thing that I realized off the bat was going to be a sticking point for me was the the author and I were approaching advertising from very different places. He's coming at it from the point of view that advertising is a center of creativity, a place where someone can make something while still being able to make a decent living. I, on the other hand, am coming at it from the point of view that advertising is manipulative and just wants you the consumer to spend your money. I don't deny there is some creativity there, but I don't think it's really some noble pursuit.<br /><br />I think the character of Dane is manic depressive or something because he flies into these ranges about the tiniest things. Or maybe he's just an asshole. Though I'm not sure the purpose was to make him an asshole. But that's how he comes across. A super unstable asshole who will start foaming at the mouth if you dare add a comma to his copy. Or if his \"work wife\" starts working with someone else in the office he gets jealous and confronts her about it and are you crazy, sir? I guess the problem is I don't think he was supposed to be a lunatic. But he is. If it was supposed to be intentional it would probably make more sense but I got the feeling we really were supposed to root for the guy.<br /><br />When he's not being a crazy person, he's really whiny. At first he's just \"defending his work\" and it almost seems noble (until you remember he's writing ads for stuff like premature ejaculation medicine and that nobility slips away). But then he does it again. And again. And again. Because EVERYONE is trying to change his work and HOW DARE THEY??? This usually means he ineffectually complains about this to a boss. Maybe because I never really understand his anger, he comes off as a petulant child instead of a genius creative whose vision is being destroyed. <br /><br />The points above I might have been fine with if the story had been shorter. Or had a purpose. Or something. But the longer I read this the more I'm thinking \"...yeah, and?\" The novel is episodic I guess, but it's getting repetitive. Dane gets a job at an agency, does BRILLIANT work (his words), some evil co-worker destroys his work just to spite him, Dane whines, Dane leaves the job (or gets fired) and gets a new one, repeat at new agency. Other than the person he's arguing with and the medicine he's shilling, nothing is changing. And Dane isn't changing at all. There is no larger point where working towards. At first I was enjoying the book but the longer I read and the more the same stuff keeps happening, the less I want to pick it up.<br /><br />Because I like to make sarcastic comments at my books, here's an exchange I had with a scene:<br /><br />\"Becky believed psychiatry was like watch repair.\" Oh, you mean how they should both be tackled my skilled professionals because they deal with a lot of small, interconnected pieces? \"Trusting a stranger to fix something of value was the surest way to break it.\" Wait, what? No. OPPOSITE. I would destroy my watch if I even thought too long about trying to repair it myself. No, I think even more than psychological problems that watch repair is something people trust others with. Simile fail.<br /><br />There's a good idea here and the writing kept me engaged until the plot quit being interesting. There are some funny moments that need fleshed out some more to really hit their mark. I described some of the scenes to Boyfriend+ and as I was saying them I was thinking \"You know this sounds like a really funny scene. But there is no payoff.\" Oh and a part near the end, it just gets weird and comes out of no where. Had things gone differently there it might have been interesting but everything sorta wrapped itself up in a nice little bow and the whole thing could have been dropped.<br /><br />One last thing, and this is probably not all that important but I feel the need to mention it. The cover is awful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know the author's daughter did it (it says so in the front) but I really did not like the cover and based on the cover alone I would pass by this book in a store. A few times I considered covering the book somehow. You know, like you'd cover a text book in grade school. I never did, but I thought about it pretty much every time I pulled the book out in public.<br /><br />Title quote from page 168<br /><br />I accepted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Sonnenschein, Eric Jay.

As luck would have it, JetBlue was running a deal where flights were 50% off, so that worked out. I'm bad at keeping track of things, so I have a bunch of vacation days I need to use, which also worked out nicely. And I love Disney. I can be sarcastic and cynical about everything else, but Disney makes me run around like a little kid. Because of the whimsy and the CRAZY attention to detail and so much fun and stop pointing out how expensive everything is. I can't hear you over the whimsy.<br /><br />Now you'd think \"Oh so you were on vacation and clearly had lots of reading time, or at least time to read on the plane so soon you'll have reviews!\" To which I respond \"Did you know JetBlue has TVs at each seat AND it turns out Taken was on AND Boyfriend+ only knew <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgmO32IdwuE\">that one speech</a> but otherwise had never seen the movie so clearly it was important we spend the flight watching Liam Neeson murder all of Paris in increasingly ridiculous ways.\" The way back was spent watching news reports about the Sandy Hook massacre, but still no reading.<br /><br />Back to happier things.

How I (don't at all) organize them","slug":"bookshelves-how-i-dont-at-all-organize-them","url":"/articles/bookshelves-how-i-dont-at-all-organize-them","body":"I feel like a lot of people, especially book bloggers, have specific methods for organizing their books. By genre, by author, by era, by color (which looks the best but seems like the least practical for when you actually want to find a book), I'm always impressed. Because my books? Not so much<br /><br />My books are organized in what I'd like to call an \"organic\" method. You might call it as \"entirely random\". We're both correct. I'm more correct because it's my blog and my bookshelves but that's OK. Our bookshelves are spread throughout the house, against any open wall. At one point there was some logic to how they were organized. \"One point\" = a few apartments ago. Any organization now is because when we packed up from that apartment books from one shelf were put in the same box, and thus twice unpacked in roughly the same order. Roughly.<br /><br />So there is a little bit of order. Most of the Shakespeare is together. The Harry Potter books are together. Christopher Moore, Jasper Fforde, and Bill Bryson are all together on a special shelf in my room along with some of my other favorites. Everything else? Wherever the book will fit. Even if that means making extra piles on the shelves. We're sort of out of walls though so I'm not sure where we can fit another bookshelf.<br /><br />I COULD get rid of books. I mean, I'm not GOING to, but I do possess the ability to get rid of books. Like physically I can move books from my shelves to a box and then bring that box elsewhere. I'm just not planning on that anytime soon. Even if Boyfriend+ thinks that wouldn't be such a bad idea.<br /><br />Oh what's that? You want to see a picture of my shelves. Oh, well, if you insist<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shelf5.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shelf4.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shelf2.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shelf3.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shelf1.jpg\" />You may have noticed that some shelves still have some space on them, like Boyfriend+'s for example. There are actually 2 other shelves in the hallway that also have space on them and therefore in theory I shouldn't need to pile books on the shelves. But see, that would require me to organize the books instead of just putting the new ones on whatever shelf is closest to me.<br /><br />Non-books things that are on the shelf, but not for decoration but because it was a shelf near me: a candle, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxx\">Fluxx</a>g, slinkies, 2 polar bear Pez dispensers, a Mets subway car pencil case, sunglasses, a camera charger.

Even for non-fantasy fans, the series is addictive<br /><br />Having now read the first book I would like to answer these expectations<br /><br />1. There's sorta world building but not Tolkien levels and the characters are names that aren't as ridiculous as I thought. It's more like every name is one letter off from a common one now (Mychal, Tyrion) OR they have names that are common now (Brandon, Jamieg)<br />2. Eh on this one. Or I didn't connect with the characters enough. Or I'm heartless.<br />3. I feel like to answer this I should say \"spoiler\" but given it was already an expectation I had going in, I don't really know how to handle this. So sorry, if you didn't already have that expectation. Now you do. I blame TV for telling me this detail already. <br />4. YUP! Not as much sexy time as the show has (so I've heard) but it's there. And it's awkward. And I think someone needs to give GRRM a lesson on female anatomy cos he makes a few errors on how lady parts work.<br />5. Well... <br /><br />I decided to give A Game of Thrones a try cos I kept hearing good things and also I was at the airport and needed a new book to download and this was one of the cheaper ones. So I started it wanting to read it, but I also couldn't help but make a lot of sarcastic comments at it. Well in my Kindle notes. I couldn't help but make sarcastic comments throughout the whole book, but they lessened as I got more and more into the story.<br /><br />The book is about a game of thrones (get it! like the title!) in a feudal world with Kings and Lords and probably serfs, although they don't get any page time. The story is told from various points of views:<br />Lord Eddard (Ned) Stark, Lord of Winterfell,<br />his bastard son Jon Snow,<br />his wife Catelynn, his daughters Sansa and Arya,<br />his non-bastard son Bran,<br />Tyrion Lannister the Queen's brother who is also a dwarf and the best character, and<br /> Daenerys (Dany) Targaryen Queen/Khaleesi of a group outside of the whole King guy.<br />So yeah, there are a lot of story lines and characters to keep straight. Sometimes the stories intersect, sometimes they go off on their own. A character list and plot outline would have been helpful at times, though overall it's easier to keep up with than I anticipated.<br /><br />The basic story: King Robert appoints Ned as Hand of the King so he and his daughters go to the Kings castle while his wife and their other children stay behind. Except his bastard son who gets sent to be a guard on a wall and has to give up his family. Oh and the Queen is really not to be trusted and no one does trust her so you'd think this wouldn't be a problem but yeah. No one seems to trust any of her family, the Lannisters, but they're all super powerful and there's a lot of them so I guess that's why they cause so many problems. There's also a separate story about Dany being sold to the Dothraki horse people so her brother can reclaim the throne and become king.<br /><br />I wouldn't call myself a fantasy fan but I did enjoy this. There's a lot of stuff about knights and fighting and swords and armor (though I found skimming through the armor &amp; weapons descriptions made things better) and battles and honor and all that jazz that you expect to find in a novel like this. There are less fantasy elements that I was expecting but there are still dragons and these weird Others wandering the woods. But there's also (most of the time) a very human element. Sure some of the characters I didn't really connect with and I wish they had been done better, but there were those whose chapters made it worth slogging through drawn out battle scenes.<br /><br />I probably will read more of the books in the series (which I just learned while writing this is called A Song of Ice and Fire and not A Game of Thrones with this book being called Ice &amp; Fire) but I'm  not rushing to start the next one. I do want to watch the show and I've been told Season 1 = Book 1, Season 2 = Book 2, etc so I'm safe to watch season 1 without spoilers. <br /><br />He's supposed to be really fearsome but I have some trouble taking a knight named Jamie seriously. Sorry. <br /> EXAMPLES: \"Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast\" - I don't think \"fast\" is the opposite of \"quick\", sir.<br />\"They were slaves...There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves\" - Um what? so there is no slavery but there ARE slaves? That's not...I think you're confused.<br />\"Damn the man!\" - Save the Empire!<br /><br />Title quote from location 2717<br /><br />Martin, George R.R. A Game of Thrones. Bantam, 2003.

Now I thought we were going dress shopping super early, but the plan was to just look. See my good friend (and maid of honor) lives in Ireland, which is a bit far away for me to call her up and suggest we go look at dresses some random weekend. Instead we planned to go when she was stateside for Thanksgiving. And by \"we planned\" I mean \"my mom planned\". And it's a good thing she planned cos I'm pretty sure if she didn't, I'd be trying to do this dress shopping last minute. Cos I'm good like that.<br /><br />As I said, the plan was just to look. I didn't want to get anything just yet. It was my first time going out to look. Of course I'd spent a lot of time on Pinterest and going through bridal magazines looking at dresses. I wanted to take my time. Anytime I try to plan something, things just go the opposite way. I should really just embrace it.<br /><br />We went to Kleinfeld's, the place where they film the original Say Yes To The Dress. And my consultant there was actually one of the women on the show (Diane, blonde hair, super nice). I was very nervous to go here. I was afraid things were going to be awkward and the sales people would be very pushy and try to get me to spend way more than I wanted. I've read reviews that said as much about Kleinfeld's. But I'm happy to say it was great and I never felt rushed or pressured and I wasn't shown anything out of my budget.  So yay.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/wedding-dress1.jpg\" /><a href=\"http://www.moniquelhuillier.com/\">Bliss by Monique Lhullier</a>I told her what I wanted (nothing shiny, nothing satin, lots of texture) and then we pulled some dresses. I actually got to try on one dress that I LOVED and it was actually one of the pictures I'd brought with me (but hadn't shown Diane yet cos apparently she can read minds). Big textured flower skirt, no sparkles and just fun. I did really love it. But it was the first dress, so I needed to try some of the other stuff we pulled.<br /><br />The next was one that was satin and ruching and fit and flare. When she first picked it out my mom saw her carrying it and mouth to me \"Oh I love that one!\" So I was really trying it on for her. But then I loved it. Like really loved it. Like \"no, I don't really want to take this off, kthxbai\". It was heavier than the first one, and of course satin (which I thought I didn't want but I just didn't want the really stiff stuff). I went back to the dressing room to try on a couple more and I got them part way on and they were just, no thank you. I got back in that first Bliss dress and again, I really liked it. I did. It was light weight and fun. But I LOVED the second dress. I thought about going to other stores and trying on other dresses and the thought of it seemed...well...pointless. Normally I want to try EVERYTHING but right then when I thought about it I knew I was just going to compare anything else to this dress.<br /><br />Now I don't have a picture of it to share. Or rather I have a picture of it, but I do sort of want it to be a surprise so I don't want to post a picture of it. I'm sorry. I know, that's mean. I promise there will be pictures after the wedding. So that's only 20 months away (roughly) so yeah. ALSO apparently I didn't go dress shopping super early cos it takes like a year for them to make the dress. So yeah. I def would have been screwed if I'd done things on my schedule.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm sorry for that tease and not sharing the wedding dress picture. That was mean of me. But I wanted to share that I got the dress.<br /><br />Now all we have left to plan is everything else. We're on our way!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:29+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:29+00:00","published_at":"2012-12-02T15:30:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e1d5dde22fdcf0004c6","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224e1e5dde22fdcf0004c7","title":"Some people, Abraham, are just too interesting to kill","slug":"some-people-abraham-are-just-too-interesting-to-kill","url":"/articles/some-people-abraham-are-just-too-interesting-to-kill","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Abraham_Lincoln_Vampire_Hunter_Cover.jpg\" />After reading <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/a-true-zombie-would-be-mine-forever\">Joyce Carol Oates's Zombie</a> I needed something that wouldn't make me sad I was reading it.g I wanted something I would enjoy. A story I could get lost in and wouldn't regret getting lost in it. I was planning on finding a funny book but I decided to go towards the absurd and picked up Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because it's not laugh out loud funny. It's not even small smirk funny. But I was a fan of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies so it seemed like a good idea to give this one a try.<br /><br />With P&amp;P&amp;Z, Austen's romance is really the backbone of the story. The zombies are there, sure, but the main point is Lizzie and Darcy. This time Lincoln's story is the backbone. The book could stand without vampires, but it couldn't stand without Lincoln. The story is a parody, sure, but it takes itself seriously. And because it takes itself seriously, you do too.<br /><br />The book is a collection of Licoln's secret diary entries, started when he was a young boy. We follow him as he vows to kill as many vampires as he can, usually with his trusty ax. Don't worry, the vampires aren't all bad (and NONE SPARKLE) and he does make make friends with a vampire named Henry Sturges who helps teach him about vampires and find the evil ones.<br /><br />So yes, the description of the story is ridiculous. But look at the title, you knew that was going to be the case. What I was surprised by was how important the non-vampire elements were. There's Lincoln's first love, his friends, his family, and what seemed like the constant loss he had to deal with. I know there's that chain lettery thing that goes around talking about all of the failures Lincoln dealt with before becoming president, but damn, to see them happen one after another and the toll it can take on a person is hard.<br /><br />The writing is also surprisingly good. Well not surprising if you've already read P&amp;P&amp;Z but better than you'd expect this to be. I can't speak for the non-Grahame-Smith mash-up books but the SGS ones are pretty great. I mean seriously, I heart this quote<br /><blockquote>\"Living men are bound by time,\" [Henry Sturges] said. \"Thus, their lives have an urgency. This gives them ambition. Makes them choose those things that are most important; cling more tightly to that which they hold dear. Their lives have seasons, and rites of passage, and consequences. And ultimately, an end. But what of a life with no urgency? What then of ambition? What then of love?\"</blockquote>So yeah, it's an easy read but a good one. One I can see myself revisiting. If you've seen the movie, let me know how it is. Cos I can see this being a good one.<br /><br />Not like because the book is sad, but sad cos no, please, I don't want those images in my head anymore.

Long time not talk to. Or \"write at\" I guess is more accurate. So, where have I been?<br /><br />First up, there was Thanksgiving! I had/have extra vacation days that I failed to use, so I took some extra time off to spend the time with my Dad down in South Carolina. I was down there l<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/upcoming-reviews-or-post-to-distract\">ast Thanksgiving</a> as well because, again, screw cold weather and YAY for lots of pets. The numbers have reversed and now my Dad has 3 cats and 6 dogs, and since I like dogs better anyway, that was pretty sweet. Like last year though, I don't really have internet access down there, save what I can get on my phone. Which means I had no easy way to post, and instead I decided to focus on reading and eating and playing with the dogs.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_mcl406lZgf1qljtns.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" hieght=\"300\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_mcl406lZgf1qljtns.gif\" /></a></center>UPDATED to include those puppy pics that I tried to give you earlier.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Dogs1.jpg\" /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Dogs2.jpg\" /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Puccini1.jpg\" /><br />I didn't actually get THAT much reading done while I was down there. Or rather I finished Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter not long into my journey down south and decided I should give this Game of Thrones thing a try and that book is a zillion and 1 pages long. Oh also AMC played Gone with the Wind on Wednesday and then The Godfather and The Godfather Part II on Thursday, so that distracted me as well.<br /><br />I was thinking I'd get a post out once I got back from the airport but that didn't so much happen. I didn't realize it but I was landing at the airport right at rush hour and taking the LIRR with luggage during peak times is NOT FUN. On top of that, Hurricane Sandy messed up one of the train tunnels, which means there are still cancelled trains, so the trains are even more crowded. AND THEN the train I got one was running 2 less cars than normal because the LIRR wanted to welcome me back and remind me what I had missed. By the time I got home, this was all I wanted:<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_mcb3vzMGKh1r982mk.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_mcb3vzMGKh1r982mk.gif\" /></a></center>I started to catch up on The Walking Dead but I failed at that because Boyfriend+ came home bearing Chinese food, so I agreed to turn off the zombies. I DID win at eating Chinese food so there you go.<br /><br />So yeah, I'll get working on a review soon. I'll also get around to reading all those blog posts that backed up on my Google Reader. It will take some time but I'm working on it. And I'll have a wedding update on Sunday that's actually about stuff from two Sundays ago, but I am bad at doing anything in a timely manner.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:30+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:30+00:00","published_at":"2012-11-28T14:26:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e1e5dde2223b60000e7","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"excuses","slug":"excuses","url":"/articles/tags/excuses"},{"value":"Thanksgiving","slug":"thanksgiving","url":"/articles/tags/thanksgiving"}]}]},{"id":"53224e1f5dde2264190005a1","title":"A true ZOMBIE would be mine forever","slug":"a-true-zombie-would-be-mine-forever","url":"/articles/a-true-zombie-would-be-mine-forever","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Zombie+cover.jpg\" />You know those books that you wish you didn't read? Not because it was a bad book or you felt like you wasted your time, but you wish you didn't have those images in your head? Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates is one of those books. It's well-written, it's a griping story, and it made me uncomfortable.<br /><br />I decided to read Zombie because it was on sale on the Kindle and it's a JCO book. I've been wanting to read something of hers and didn't know where to start. Something on sale seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />I knew going into this it wasn't going to be a zombie story. I mean, I know it's titled Zombie but it's not that kind of zombie. Instead of the walking dead coming back and feeding on the living as they try to survive and make sense of this new world, it's about a guy that is trying to make sex zombies a la Jeffrey Dahmer. So, you know, way worse.<br /><br />It's not the \"create a sex zombie via transorbital lobotomy done with rusty tools\" that made me not like this book. OK, well not the only thing. Quentin is the protagonist and it's a first person story. Which means you spend the whole book hanging out in the mind of this deranged serial killer. I do not like hanging out in Quentin's mind. I don't want to know what he's thinking, I don't want to follow him around as he plans and justifies his murders. There was never a moment I felt sympathy for Quentin. I mostly kept hoping he'd set on fire. Not that it would have made sense for the plot but still.<br /><br />It takes a little while to get used to the writing style. Quentin switches back and forth between referring to himself in the first person, or referring to himself as Q__ P__. He refers to his victims by nicknames like RAISINEYES and SQUIRREL. He has no empathy whatsoever. He manipulates his family that is truly too good for him. It wouldn't have been surprising if the story focused on why Quentin did the things he does, maybe how his family messed him up. But no, you don't get that. There's no explanation for why he does the things he does. Which is both what elevates the story and makes it so hard to read. Awful things happen to innocent people and it's not fair.<br /><br />One of the ways I decide that I really like a book is if I want to read it again. I do not want to read this one again. I don't (entirely) regret reading this, but it is not one I can see myself revisiting. I spent some time in this lunatic's head and I'm good now. All set. Zombie can join American Psycho in books that are well-written and I'm happy to never pick up again. Amazon also groups these two together in the Frequently Bought Together section.<br /><br />The plus side, this counts towards the <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/11/smooth-criminals-reading-challenge-for.html\">Smooth Criminals challenge</a>! Now I'm in no way going to finish the this challenge, but I'll keep trying till the end of the year. And by trying I mean unintentionally reading a book that fits the criteria for one of the categories.

Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore because THE BEST <br /><br />2. The Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde because I will need some sort of fantasy to forget I'm stranded. Also this means I get a bunch of books and can keep it as one item<br /><br />3. World War Z by Max Brooks because then I can think \"At least this island doesn't have zombies on it.\" If the island does, I would like to change this book...<br /><br />4. Let's Pretend This Never Happened by Jenny Lawson because I will need something that makes me laugh until I'm crying while I slowly starve to death.<br /><br />5. The Complete Works of William Shakespeare because those stories are timeless and maybe while I have nothing else to do I'll make it through the plays I've yet to tackle. Also when someone eventually finds my body they'll see this and think I was smart.<br /><br />6.  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard because we may as well keep the Shakespeare together.

Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clark because you should have a chunkster with you while you have all this uninterrupted reading time.<br /><br />9. Kindred by Octavia Butler because ending up in a terrible predicament means you should read about someone that was way worse. It's like literary schadenfreude.<br /><br />10.

The Grapes of Wrath readalong (which was super fun) took up a lot of time, as well as the book Ad Nomad, which I'm still working my way through. Anyway, I decided I needed to fix that so I picked up Stephen King's Pet Sematary. And then a couple days later we got slammed by Hurricane Sandy and we lost power. I mentioned before, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/reading-by-flashlight\">I COULD have stopped reading Pet Sematary</a> and gone with something else. Something better to read when you have no power and are trying to balance a flashlight. But I'm stubborn so I kept going. I'm very happy our power came back before I finished this.<br /><br />There are some King books I'll recommend to people who aren't horror fans. Pet Sematary is not one of them. Go into this one knowing you will be getting a horror story. King even says that this is the book that scares him. But it's so much more than just a simple scary story.<br /><br />I first read this book in college for my Horror Fiction class. I'm glad I did because there's something about the basic plot synopsis that doesn't interest me. The Creed family (husband Louis, wife Rachel, daughter Ellie, son Gage) move to an idyllic home in Maine (of course), but there's an evil lurking in the woods behind their house. Sure, there's the Pet Sematary, a place where the neighborhood kids bury their passed pets, and that's sorta creepy. But there's something beyond the cemetery, down the dead fall where something ominous resides. And the family will learn that sometimes dead is better.<br /><br />See that's creepy but nothing to really grab my attention. However, that's not really what the story is about. I mean, that's what happens but it's really about death. It's about dealing with the very real experience of death, something everyone will face. It's about coming to terms with the inevitability, not only for yourself but for your loved ones. And it's what happens when you refused to come to terms with it.<br /><br />What really got me interested in the story was King's introduction. Or rather the story about his own daughter that inspired the story and even featured in the book. King lived in a home similar to the Creeds that  was also on a very busy street. And like Ellie, King's young daughter had a cat. And like Ellie's cat Church, King's daughter's cat got run over by a truck. King and his wife tell his daughter what happened and they bury her cat in the pet sematary down the street from them, and all seemed fine. Until that night when he heard his daughter jumping up and down on bubble wrap screaming \"I want my cat back! God can get his OWN cat!\" I don't know what it is exactly but I love that scene, in both King's retelling of his daughter and Ellie's reaction at the thought of Church getting hurt.<br /><br />This is a deeply upsetting book. It's scary, absolutely. It's scary and unsettling. But more than that, it's upsetting. It's a book that made me cry, where Grapes never did. It's a book that makes you WANT to jump up and down on  bubble wrap and curse God because sometimes unfair things happen. And I always love a book where I spend the whole time hoping things will turn out differently this time, even though I know exactly how things are going to go.<br /><br />I know I haven't really said much about the story, but I don't want to give away too much. Just know that this is one of King's best, at least out of the ones I've read. If you like horror, or at least if you are willing to try horror, read this one. Oh and avoid the movie. Just ignore that one.<br /><br />Title quote from page 46<br /><br />King, Stephen. Pet Sematary. Pocket Books, 2001.

Or the better question is, how do you hold a stupid flashlight AND comfortably hold a book without having to reposition yourself 4,000 times before you give up and just stare at nothing because at least that doesn't require coordination.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Hurricane Sandy knocked out our power. Which is, at the time of writing, still out. When the power first went out on Monday I figured I'd at least have lots of uninterrupted reading time. How great will that be? And then there was the realization of \"I need light to read\" and \"boy it sure gets dark during a hurricane\". I tried to use this lantern thing, which says it provides \"room filling light\". It is a liar. If I had been able to build a contraption to suspend it right above where I was reading, maybe it would have worked. I tried to use a flashlight but couldn't figure out how to position it. For a while I held the book in one hand and the flashlight in another. But eventually both my flashlight arm and my book thumb were getting sore. Then I tried holding it under my chin but trying to get it to stay where you need so it's neither blindingly bright nor too shadowy to read proved a challenge.<br /><br />There has to be a trick to this. Cos I was starting to think that those miner helmets with the lights on them aren't such a bad idea.<br /><br />I did get some reading done. But it was mostly uncomfortable and distracted.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't started my book right before the storm. I was all set to reread Pet Semetary, which I have as a dead-tree book. Had I not started it, I would have been fine reading a book on my Kindle. Before the storm I saw a few tweets from people who were very clear that they were stocking up on non-e-books. Which makes sense because ebooks must be read on a reader that must be charged by electricity, and the threats were there would be none. However, I can't help but think the people who made these proclamations (as opposed to those who just said they were stocking up books) don't actually own an ereader.<br /><br />I can't speak for all of the options out there, but I have a Kindle. My Kindle has like a month's worth of battery on a single charge. So I made sure it was charged before the storm, which means I'm not really in danger here of running out of reading material. I also have a case with a built in light, which means I don't have to juggle the flashlight or sit dangerously close to candles in order to see.<br /><br />Now, I only read a little of the book on my, but that's because I'm stubborn and had just started Pet Semetary and didn't want to change. I'm not saying an ereader is better in this situation or normal books. I'm just saying, could you quit being tools about ereader vs normal books. They both have advantages and disadvantages so can't we just enjoy all of them?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/kindle&amp;books.jpeg_.jpg\" />Didn't really mean for this to turn into a rant. This is what happens when you take away someone's heat for long periods of time and make them throw out all of the food in their fridge, even though some of those condiments were BARELY USED and it's going to cost a fortune to restock.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:33+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:33+00:00","published_at":"2012-11-02T15:26:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e215dde223867000269","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Hurricane Sandy","slug":"hurricane-sandy","url":"/articles/tags/hurricane-sandy"},{"value":"e-reader","slug":"e-reader","url":"/articles/tags/e-reader"}]}]},{"id":"53224e215dde2223b60000ea","title":"Final Grapes post & Hurricane update.","slug":"final-grapes-post-and-hurricane-update","url":"/articles/final-grapes-post-and-hurricane-update","body":"Sorry I don't have a better title this week.

No flooding and the only real casualty we faced in the storm was our grill cover. It didn't blow away, but it held on so fiercely that it ripped in half. RIP friend. We did however lose power Monday afternoon and according to reports we shouldn't expect to get it back for 7-10 days. Apparently something like 90% of Long Island is without power, so there's a lot of commiserating on the island, as well as plans to burst into the locations that do have electricity. At least I've been making those plans. Watch out, bagel place down the street.<br /><br />Boyfriend+'s work has power AND they got their internet up today, hence how I can post this.

Yup\".<br /><br />- After pretty much everything Ma says to Pa in the beginning of chapter 26 I want to yell \"Ooo buuurn\".

Aww Steinbeck thanks! This is aweso-OH MY GOD, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM? WHY DID YOU CAVE HIS HEAD IN?<br />- And Tom killed another guy.

I'm going to need to repeat that a few more times.<br />- I was on the edge of my seat the whole time the family was leaving the camp with Tom hidden in the back. Thank you Steinbeck for not having Tom dragged off, as I assumed. <br />- The Joads found more work! I figured Steinbeck would have them wander the roads until they all starved, got run over by trucks. They even have a boxcar to live in instead of a tent, but they lost the hot water. And naturally the people at the farm are all \"how dare you ask for hot water? Why would you think you're entitled to that?\" because they're assholes.<br /> - Good for Tom, deciding that he should work to help the migrant workers. However, given his temper he's displayed throughout the whole book, his plan is probably going to work for roughly five minutes before he bludgeons someone to death again.<br />- Pa, I know you're sad that Ma is making all the decisions and you're supposed to be the Man of the house and blah blah blah. Maybe if you took charge at all, you could still be the one to lead. But when times are tough you just get quiet so Ma takes over. Because she is the best. <br />- Oh good, torrential rain.

But then I realized she and Winfield (who haven't starved to death as of the end of the book! Small victories!) are sort of the only hope left. At least they still act like kids the whole time. If they had been broken, sort of like the kids at the Hooverville, then I don't know if I could have taken anymore. <br />- Of course the baby was born dead. Of course. Because Steinbeck hates us all.<br />- I'm having mixed feelings about the ending. Because on the one hand, Rosasharn completely makes up for anything annoying she did by feeding this dying old man. On the other hand wtf Steinbeck? I totally blocked that ending from memory in high school.<br />- So I guess Alfred the American spirit turtle isn't making a reappearance. Because the American spirit is dead. Thanks for that uplifting ending.<br /><br />I'm happy I read this again (Thanks Laura!) because if nothing else, I'm now less intimidated to give East of Eden a try.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:33+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:33+00:00","published_at":"2012-10-31T14:33:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e215dde2223b60000eb","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"John Steinbeck","slug":"john-steinbeck","url":"/articles/tags/john-steinbeck"},{"value":"Grapes of Wrath","slug":"grapes-of-wrath","url":"/articles/tags/grapes-of-wrath"},{"value":"readalong","slug":"readalong","url":"/articles/tags/readalong"}]}]},{"id":"53224e225dde2223b60000ec","title":"\"It is hard to find a friend,\" I said. \"It is the hardest thing in this world,\" he agreed.","slug":"it-is-hard-to-find-a-friend-i-said-it-is-the-hardest-thing-in-this-world-he-agreed","url":"/articles/it-is-hard-to-find-a-friend-i-said-it-is-the-hardest-thing-in-this-world-he-agreed","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Sisters+Brothers.jpg\" />Where to I even begin? I know! By procrastinating on this review a little longer by writing about book expectations.<br /><br />This isn't the first time that I've picked up a book because other bloggers convinced me I have to. Of course I can't think of any specific examples right now, but it's happened, trust me. This time though it wasn't just a recommendation. I sort of had to read The Sisters Brothers. Not only read it but LOVE IT. <a href=\"http://theterribledesire.blogspot.com/2012/06/impossible-to-review-sisters-brothers.html\">Megs</a>, <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/04/of-kleenex-and-bears.html\">Alice</a>, and <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2012/07/devouring-books-sisters-brothers-by.html\">Laura</a> all raved about it. That's so much pressure. What if I don't like it? I think I'd be shunned.<br /><br />Of course there's a problem when expectations are really built up. Can anything ever stand up to such high hopes? Would the book have been better received if you weren't expecting it to be earth shattering? Of course, any recommendation is going to give you some sort of expectation for the book. And if you ignore all recommendations to avoid setting any sort of expectation before you begin, you're going to miss out. <br /><br />If they (the three above and book bloggers as a whole) hadn't recommended this book, I'm sure I would have passed it by. Western, what now? No, that's cool. You keep your dusty guys and their horses and I'll just be over here. But guys, The Sisters Brothers isn't like that! Well it is, cos there are dusty guys and horses, but I loooove them. Sure, they're hired guns and there's lots of horse riding and shooting and bourbon drinking and the Gold Rush and stuff that I would expect to find in a Western. But there is so much more. The brothers, Eli and Charlie, make the story. Especially Eli, which works out nicely given he's the narrator.<br /><br />Eli and Charlie are hired guns with quite the reputation. Charlie seems to really enjoy the work, but Eli's not so sure anymore. As they make the journey from Oregon City to San Francisco to kill the prospector Hermann Warm Eli decides maybe this job will be his last.<br /><br />One thing about reading a book that other people have already reviewed, it means that I already have their thoughts in my head while I'm reading. At least some of their thoughts. Like Megs comment about how Eli squishes women with his love. Yeah, I kept thinking that. It may have stuck in my head because of that lion gif or because the statement is SO ACCURATE. (Both) Oh Eli, I know you mean well, but maybe back down a little bit. For a hit man he can be very sentimental, even when it comes to his sort-of-useless-but-not-at-all-I-love-him horse Tub.<br /><br />I love the relationship between the brothers. It seems like it's a simple case of Charlie being the leader and Eli following, but there's more than that. There's genuine affection between the two, not only Eli for Charlie (what with all that sentimentality) but also Charlie for Eli, in his own way. His own kind of messed up way. But behind all of the affection, all of the humor is a constant feeling of sadness and loneliness. Which makes sense for a man who makes his living killing but doesn't want to anymore.<br /><br />So I started this talking about expectations going into a book. There may have been some worry that I didn't like The Sisters Brothers. But I did. I did enjoy it and I can see myself reading it again. However I do think had the expectations not been built up so high I would have liked it even more. It would have surprised me with how good it really was. I hope on a second reading I can focus more on the story and the characters and the language itself. <br /><br />I can't think of anything else to say so let me just throw some quotes out there, since I highlighted so much and this needs to be shared<br /><br />\"The creak of bed springs suffering under the weight of a restless man is as lonely a sound as I know.\"<br /><br />\"I reentered the cave to stoke the fire, curling up beside it for warmth, but I could not sleep without proper covering and instead spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious.\"<br /><br />\"Nodding politely, I said, 'Yes, well, it is fairly obvious that you are in love with me!\"<br />'No,' she said, coloring. 'Not that.'<br />'I can see it. Hopelessly in love, powerless to guard against it. You shouldn't feel too badly about it, it has happened before.'\"<br /><br />\"It must not have been that I loved the bookkeeper, but that I loved the idea of her loving me, and the idea of not being alone.\"<br /><br />Hmm, a Western.

If you've been playing along, welcome! If not, I bet this has been boring for you. Sorry. Hope you're at least enjoying the gifs. As with each of these readalong posts, there will be spoilers.<br /><br />First, things are awful in California. Of course EVERYONE has been telling the Joads that pretty much since they left, so, yeah.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_ly431lGaTd1rn95k2o1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_ly431lGaTd1rn95k2o1_500.gif\" /></a></center>Except to the Joads who really held onto the idea that because there were fliers there were unlimited jobs and the streets were paved with gold. I know, I'm being mean to the Joads because once they started their trek towards California it's not like they had much of a choice but to press on, even if they knew it was going to be no use. They didn't have the money to get the gas to go anywhere else. But a little acknowledgement on the Joads part would be nice.<br /><br />We also lose a couple more people because the family is falling apart. But this time no one dies which is an improvement? Maybe. Casy goes to jail after a skirmish at the campsite, presumably never to be heard from again. A man tries to ensure fair wages which equals COMMUNIST so the police are called in, and they proceed to shoot a lady in the hand. Tom trips the cop and Casy knocks him unconscious. And since Tom is on paroleg Casy takes the blame and is happy to be hauled away having helped the family. We the readers, on the other hand, have lost another one of the better characters. Dammit Steinbeck.<br /><br />Connie also wanders off, I guess as he attempts to walk back to Oklahoma? I don't think he really got the details worked out apart from \"Screw California. I'm going home.\" I'm sure he'll be a real success back at home after taking some classes.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=XAxaV.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/XAxaV.gif\" /></a></center>There is a tiny ray of hope for the Joads. They end up at a government camp where the cops aren't allowed and there are toilets. Things start looking up when the Joads get running water and then I realized how low my standards have fallen for \"happy times\". But the family can finally hang out for awhile without being harassed and having to move every day. The men can look for work, although things aren't really that much better there. However the other families in the camp help take care of each other. Steinbeck is not subtle with his with his \"we must all stick together in order to survive\" thing.<br /><br />Last time the family chapters were super depressing and the in between/vignette chapters had the hope (Mae &amp; her penny candy). This time the Joad chapters have the little ray of hope and the vignettes offer up the taste of everything that's awful. There's a chapter where they talk about how farming has become an industry and a business, how the land and the crops don't matter except to the bottom line, how the people who are hired to gather the food are imported in, treated like slaves, and deported when no longer needed. How food is left rot while people are starving because it's too expensive to actually pick it. It's unfortunate how much of this is still true today. Sorry Steinbeck, your dreams of sharing and caring have not come true.<br /><br />So how much more depressing can this get? <br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m76jaxlTis1qmgw1m.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m76jaxlTis1qmgw1m.gif\" /></a></center>Only one section left to find out.<br /><br />How would they check that he's on parole in Oklahoma out in California? It's not like now where there are computers and the CA cops can check the guy out in a database. How would they find this out?<br /><br />Title quote from page 316<br /><br />Steinbeck, John.

Well that's not true, in that I do have an appointment for wedding dress shopping in a few weeks. Right now it look like the whole wedding is going to be planned around the dress. Assuming that's the first thing that gets figured out. That's the way people normally do this planning, right?<br /><br />In the meantime I wanted to get opinions from people about destination weddings. What do you think of them? At what point does a wedding count as a destination wedding?<br /><br />What makes  a wedding a destination wedding? Do you have to go out of the country for it? Do the bride and groom have to be the ones to travel?  Is it only a destination wedding if EVERYONE has to travel? This doesn't really have anything to do with actually planning the wedding, just something I was curious about. I've traveled to Arizona for a wedding, but the bride and groom lived there, so not really destination. I've also traveled to New Hampshire for a wedding, which I wouldn't really consider a destination wedding, although I, the bride &amp; groom, and most people had to travel for it.<br /><br />Regardless of what might technically count as a destination wedding, what do you think of them? Would you skip it if you were invited to a destination wedding?<br /><br />Obviously there are additional costs. You have to get to the location. And pay for a hotel. Which are things you may need to do for non-destination weddings (I had to do for both the AZ &amp; NH weddings). But I guess the assumption is it would cost more?<br /><br />There may be additional time off work, depending on how far away the place is and when the wedding is.<br /><br />On my end it is more difficult to plan things if the location isn't nearby. OR it's way easier, cos I just tell someone at the location \"you do it\". So that can be good or bad, depending on how much control you want over the little details. I would like someone to just do it all for me, so this goes in the \"plus\" column.<br /><br />Other than this I guess I don't really know the pros and cons for a destination wedding versus a local one. Clearly I'm doing a bang up job with this whole wedding planning thing. So yeah, if you have any insights, please share.<br />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:34+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:34+00:00","published_at":"2012-10-21T18:51:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e225dde2264190005a6","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224e235dde22386700026a","title":"I'm not negative, you jerk","slug":"im-not-negative-you-jerk","url":"/articles/im-not-negative-you-jerk","body":"Hey, remember how I used to do these random word clouds of my blog? No? Cos I haven't done them in about a year? Right, makes sense.<br /><br />The other day I remembered I hadn't done one of those in awhile and decided I wanted to again. But whenever I do build one it's just made up of my 6 most recent posts. But I want my word cloud to represent MOAR DATA. So I decided to play around with a social listening tool to pull in more posts. Here's what that looks like<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/wordcloud10.12.jpg\" /><br />Yeah I know, not that interesting. Oh I say \"book\" and \"read\" a lot? Who would have guessed.<br /><br />BUT while I was in this tool I decided to take a look at the sentiment section and see what it says. And it told me I am mostly negative. Wait, what?<br /><br />It said, for the past year, 22% of my content as been positive, 37% neutral and 41% negative. Granted, my first reaction to those stats was to IM a friend and go \"Apparently my blog is 41% negative. Well fuck you then!\". So yeah, maybe they have a point.<br /><br />Then I really looked at why the system was being so judgy. Essentially anytime I used a negative word like \"bad\" or \"don't like\" it said the section was negative. Of course, as with any automated system, it can't take into account context. The system can't tell I said \"Now normally I don't like this, but this book nailed it perfectly. Kudos\" It also marks my entire rant about wanting to set a character on fire because I hate them so much as \"positive\" because I said the character was \"SO PERFECT\".<br /><br />Moral of this post:<br />Word clouds are pretty boring but have shapes and colors so people like them (me included)<br />Context is important<br />Computers do not get sarcasm<br />Automated sentiment is pointless","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:35+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:35+00:00","published_at":"2012-10-18T13:15:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e235dde22386700026b","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Book Word Cloud","slug":"book-word-cloud","url":"/articles/tags/book-word-cloud"}]}]},{"id":"53224e235dde22fdcf0004cf","title":"Up ahead they's a thousan' lives we might live, but when it comes, it'll on'y be one","slug":"up-ahead-theys-a-thousan-lives-we-might-live-but-when-it-comes-itll-ony-be-one","url":"/articles/up-ahead-theys-a-thousan-lives-we-might-live-but-when-it-comes-itll-ony-be-one","body":"It's Tuesday which means it's time for another <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-grapes-of-wrath-part-2-it-dont-take.html\">Grapes of Wrath readalong post</a>! This time we're dealing with chapters 12-18. Heads up, there will be spoilers. And the sadness is mounting.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/grapes2.jpg\" /><br />The family stops to get some gas and they are accused of being bums, the family's dog gets run over, and then grandpa dies. Damn Steinbeck. I need a minute<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=ZqOBM.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/ZqOBM.gif\" /></a></center>Turns out drugging Grandpa was probably not the best idea. Who will Grandma shoot in the ass? Who will button their shirt into their underwear? Who will give us even a second of comic relief?<br /><br />There are moments that aren't quite so depressing. Everyone is in a shitty situation. We haven't met anyone really living it up during this exodus from the dustbowl. What we do get to see is people being kind to one another. And I mean perfect strangers. People sharing a limited and ever dwindling supply of food, caring for the sick, helping keep the cars running. Thank you Steinbeck, because if it was just wave after wave of awful things happening to the Joads and then people being terrible to each other, I wouldn't be able to take it.<br /><br />Even the scene with waitress Mae and cook Al gives me happy feelings. Mae and Al may be staying put, their lives aren't being completely uprooted but they're affected by the depression. So when the family asks to buy a loaf of bread you may not like it, but you at least understand her reluctance. They can't do this for everyone that comes by or they'll have to go on the move as well. While you can understand it, you still want Mae to relent. So it's that much more touching when she sells the boys two pieces of nickle candy for a penny. Then you see this pay-it-forward as the truckers leave her a large tip. It's like those commercials for...something.g (I guess I could look it up. Could being the important word there.)<br /><br /> BUT Steinbeck isn't done with the awfulness in this section. So after a couple chapters of things happy (happy in the relative Grapes of Wrath way) things naturally have to turn around. All those times of people being not-assholes to each other are over, and all the happy feelings are done.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m7blc6sG8t1qbrzcm.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m7blc6sG8t1qbrzcm.gif\" /></a></center>Grandma's been raving ever since Grandpa passed. Which is sweet in a messed up, Grapes of Wrath version of sweet (similar to that version of happy before). Ma tells everyone she's just tired, including the very pushy people that insist on busting into the tent to loudly pray for her. And then...you know...<br /><br />Noah wanders off and decides he's not going to head off to California with the family and instead he'll hang out by the river and eat fish. And Tom really doesn't do too much to convince him otherwise, which seems mean when you consider how important Ma said keeping the family together is. Jerk.<br /><br />To make up for all of those people being nice to each other in trying times, we have the cops in California being general assholes to people. Assholes with some purpose, as they are trying to make sure shanty towns don't show up along the highway as the displaced farmers give up their trek and stop wherever their cars give out. Which, while not a fun thing, isn't being awful for the sake of being awful. Though they do seem to take joy in being assholes.<br /><br />Ma, however, is continuing to kick ass. And a few times that gets literal and she threatens to first beat down anyone suggesting that the family split up. Then she stands up to the cop who busts in on the family when they're camping to tell them to move along. Then she convinces the border guards to let her and her family go through while she stays in the back of the truck with Grandma's body. Ma is the best. She is stronger than all of the other characters put together.<br /><br />To counter all of the sadness that has come and is yet to come, here's a waving bear.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m6q96sy2wt1rqx3tlo1_400.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Waving Bear\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m6q96sy2wt1rqx3tlo1_400.gif\" /></a></center>I am afraid of what the Joads have to deal with next. Maybe we all stop now and assume that California is 10x as awesome as the Joads think (ignoring all of the families coming back from Cali telling them how terrible it is) and everyone is happy the end.<br /><br />PS cos I forgot to mention that Rosasharn &amp; Connie totally do it right next to the dying/dead body of Grandma. Apparently that is the comic relief we get and Grandpa isn't around to button his shirt into his underwear. <br /><br />Or, you know, it's like the Pay It Forward movie. But that's clearly too obvious.<br /><br />Title quote from page 168<br /><br />Steinbeck, John. The Grapes of Wrath. Penguin, 1992.

I am not the best at keeping stories straight so I try to stick to one story, finish it and then move on. But right now I'm reading not one, not two, but THREE books. This has the potential to go very badly.<br /><br />First up, I'm reading <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/the-grapes-of-wrath-readalong-grapey.html\">The Grapes of Wrath for Laura's readalong</a>. Now because for a readalong we're suppose to read up to a certain point. And to make sure I don't confuse myself with my posts, I make sure to only read the assigned chapters before writing my stuff. So I NEED another book to read.<br /><br />Next, I'm reading Ad Nomad by Eric Jay Sonnenschien. It's a book I agreed to read and review. And it's long. And I'm just over halfway through but I need a break from it. I will hold any other comments about it until my review, when I've finished it, but I was reading it the other day and decided I needed something else for awhile.<br /><br />So finally, I'm reading The Sisters Brothers by Patrick deWitt. I've wanted to read this for awhile. Pretty much since <a href=\"http://theterribledesire.blogspot.com/2012/06/impossible-to-review-sisters-brothers.html\">Meg</a>, <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/04/of-kleenex-and-bears.html\">Alice</a>, and <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/devouring-books-sisters-brothers-by.html\">Laura</a> went on and on about the AMAZINGNESS of this one. So when Amazon had it on sale for Kindle at $2.99 I HAD to buy it. So, yeah.<br /><br />I just realized I'm lacking in scary reads for the month. I will need to get some Stephen King or something on my to read list. Which means I need to get it together and put together a list of how I rate the King I have read, so Laura can make a recommendation for me, which she so kindly offered to do. And which I WILL get to. Soon. Soonish.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm hoping I don't go mixing up plots and characters from these three books. Although so far I think it'd be funny if there was any sort of cross over. Or at least if any of the Joads or Charlie and Eli showed up in Ad Nomad. I'm sure that would end up with wacky shenanigans. Or violence and depression. Either way.<br /><br />On a slightly related note, Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates is also currently on sale for the Kindle. I've never read any JCO before. <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2012/05/zombie-by-joyce-carol-oates.html\">Brenna</a> said this isn't a favorite Oates for her so I'm wondering if maybe I skip it until I try one of her other books first. Or maybe I just start with this one cos a) SALE and b) it's called Zombie and I know, it's not about a zombie in the typical sense but still. Horror-y so good for the season.

And then I apparently thought I finished the post so last night I didn't bother to check it or anything. A new episode of Hoarders was on so yeah, I had some really important stuff going on. Anyway, instead of doing a nicely composed piece, here are a bunch of bullet points!<br /><br />-There are so many things I did not remember/didn't notice when I read this in high school which proves that public school totally misses the things that they should point out when reading a book, if you want the class to pay attention to the important things.g <br /><br />- Preacher goes on and on about banging young, virginal church girls. How did I miss this the first time around?<br /><br />- A pig eats a baby. Seriously, wtf? And it's just mentioned like \"Oh yeah, we make sure to keep the gate closed cos last time it was open a pig got out and ate the neighbor's baby. It made her go a little crazy, but it's like, 'Get over it already'. Anyway, yeah, keep that gate closed\"<br /><br />- I really like those in between chapters not about the Joads. Not that I DISLIKE the Joad stuff and I think an entire book written like those \"in between\" chapters (which prob have a fancy name that I don't know) would be painful to read after awhile, but this macro-view of the time is so powerful.<br /><br />- I would never have made it during this era. I don't know how to do anything Ma &amp; co have to do.<br /><br />- This is how you do dialect in a book. I'm still not crazy about it but at least I can understand what's being said without having to read it out loud (which is awkward on the subway). I get a feeling for the tone and speech of the Joads while not impeding the story. Kudos, Mr. Steinbeck. Kudos.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=utiBn.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/utiBn.gif\" /></a></center>- I seriously remember NOTHING of this book. Nothing. I thought maybe something would come back but no. It's like I blocked it entirely.<br /><br />- Can someone smarter/less lazy than me explain the turtle? <br /><br />- I haven't cried yet but this is already so depressing. I fear for what's coming.<br /><br />That said, I feel teachers who DO point these things out are the same teachers that get yelled at for corrupting kids and then those books get banned. That's how banned books happen, isn't it?<br /><br />Title quote from page 50<br /><br />Steinbeck, John. The Grapes of Wrath. Penguin, 1992. Originally published 1939.

It just sorta happen. I tripped and found myself in the bookstore and then I ended up near the discount books and there's such good stuff there. I've made some bizarre rule with myself where I won't buy just one book. I have to find at least 2. Somehow that's my logic for buying less books. In other words, I don't understand logic.<br /><br />ANYWAY, what I'm saying is I picked up another Dennis Lehane book because for whatever reason, those randomly show up on the discount table so I have to get them. This time it was Shutter Island. On the one hand, I really wish I didn't already know the endingg. On the other hand, I sorta loved the book anyway. Or at least really liked it.<br /><br />This is very unlike the other Lehane's I've read. It's about a crime but I don't think of it as a crime novel, like the other books. It's not as graphic or as violent. The setting is Ashecliffe Hospital, a hospital/prison for the criminally insane. And yet I'm never really worried about the psycho killers. So while it's unlike Lehane's other stuff in terms of plot, it still feels like one of his books.<br /><br />It's 1954 and a patient has gone missing from the hospital so US Marshall Teddy Daniels has been called in to find her. The mystery is the hospital is located on Shutter Island. How do you escape an island? But Teddy and his new partner Chuck Aule learn that nothing is at it seems on this island. There's a missing doctor and overall no one seems overly concerned that there's an insane murderer wandering about.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/the-circus-arrives-without-warning\">The Night Circus</a> was all about atmosphere. The plot was incidental. Here the plot and atmosphere work off of each other to create a really good story. It's creepy and it sucked me in. I wanted to know what happened next, I wanted to know what happened to Rachel and I wanted to know what was going on at this hospital. I didn't think deep thoughts. The other Lehane books got under my skin more. But this is a book I can see myself revisiting. <br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet. After reading this I really want to. So if you've seen it let me know how it is.<br /><br />Why no, I don't know the ending because of the movie, though that would be a logical conclusion. I know it because of a Cracked article. I ruined the ending for myself to read a snarky piece on a comedy website.

Because I have read Grapes before. And I did not like it.<br /><br />OK to be fair, I read it my sophomore year in high school. And I didn't read it because I WANTED to. I read it because class made me. And I wasn't a big fan of that teacher. (For reasons that have less to do with him and more to do with the fact that teenagers are idiots.) If you ask me what I remember about the book I will tell you....nothing. I don't remember a thing. Anything I know about the book comes from references in culture and not because I read it. So this all seems like a perfect reason to tell teenage me to shut up and just read the book.<br /><br />I've only read two Steinbeck: The Pearl and Grapes. I've wanted to read Of Mice and Men and East of Eden, but I haven't, mostly because of bad memories of the other two. Well, maybe not bad memories. I was scarred by the other books. Just sort of \"I could read more Steinbeck. Or I could read something I know I'll like.

And people said they were. And then I didn't post anything (other than <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/expert-lady-asks-is-he-ready-to-get\">bitching about that advice lady</a>). Whoops. But that's because I haven't really had anything to share.<br /><br />I'm not big on planning things. And I haven't been dreaming of my wedding since I was little. We're also spreading out this engagement thing so we can take our time figuring out what we want and give us a chance to win the lottery or find a pot of gold or something. So while I don't have any plans to write about (yet), I do have something that's not me complaining about wedding/marriage advice: the engagement ring.<br /><br />When Boyfriend+ proposed he didn't have a ringg. He'd been telling me if he was going to propose he would do it with an onion ring. A vidalia onion ring. You know, keep it classy. But he didn't have one of those either. Something to do with he wouldn't be able to sneak it past me and the grease would stain his shorts.<br /><br />It took a lot of shopping around before I finally found a ring. Well actually I found a ring that was really beautiful fairly quickly, but the problem was it wasn't an engagement ring, which meant it was kind of a funky shape, which meant it didn't fit nicely with a wedding band, which means getting it to fit would required getting a custom band made, which is lots of money. I could wear it on my right hand, but I'd really rather wear both rings together. Besides, I like the claddagh that I wear on my right hand.<br /><br />FYI, if you're ring shopping and you mention that you don't want a diamond, be prepared for people to insist that no, no, you DO want a diamond, silly girl. You're just confused. See diamonds are for engagement rings. After a few stores we stopped telling people we were looking for an engagement ring. Unless they asked point blank, but most don't. I guess they assume if it's an engagement ring, you'll tell them. But yeah, I didn't want a diamond. I wanted an aquamarine. I love the stone, I love the color and it's both my and Boyfriend+'s birth stone. It means more to me than a diamond.<br /><br />I FINALLY found an awesome store that is all about getting you what you want instead of making sure you're sticking with tradition. The woman I talked to there was so friendly and so helpful. And she got me a bunch of aquamarine stones to choose from. So yeah, if you're ever out on Long Island and need jewelry (I know, happens all the time), check out Frassanito Jewelers. Figured I should mention them by name, since they kick so much ass.<br /><br />So 78 days after the proposal I got my ring! And I love it. It's not like what I thought I wanted (except for the aquamarine). It's much simpler than I thought I wanted. And here it is!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Ring1.jpg\" /> Preeeeettttttyy So given how long that took, it should be awhile before I have any more wedding updates. Although Mom is already ALL ABOUT dress shopping, so perhaps I'll have something about that next. Or else I'll complain about something in a wedding magazine. Lots of inspiration there.<br /><br />(So I meant to post this this morning. And instead I forgot about it until now. Whoops.)<br /><br />Which TheKnot.com says is the<a href=\"http://wedding.theknot.com/getting-engaged/marriage-proposals/articles/wedding-proposals-5-biggest-proposal-mistakes.aspx\"> number one proposal faux pas</a> and shut up. The engagement wasn't any less legit because I didn't get a ring right then. The \"propose in front of an audience\" thing is on the list, and I agree with that. It says even if you DO accept the proposal, you sorta want to be in your own bubble for a little while. Boyfriend+ and I stayed in that bubble for a week while we were on vacation (we told people when we came home) and it was lovely.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:37+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:37+00:00","published_at":"2012-10-01T00:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e255dde22fdcf0004d2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224e265dde22386700026c","title":"If you lose a son it's possible to get another--and there's only one Maltese falcon","slug":"if-you-lose-a-son-its-possible-to-get-another-and-theres-only-one-maltese-falcon","url":"/articles/if-you-lose-a-son-its-possible-to-get-another-and-theres-only-one-maltese-falcon","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Maltese+Falcon+cover.jpg\" />Even without being super familiar with the movie (I've seen it once or twice and remember pieces of it, but not the majority) the movie can't help but overshadow the book. It's so iconic that even without remembering the specifics of the movie, you know the feel, you know the scenes, you know the tone. It sort of made reading the book an uphill battle.<br /><br />Think about every stereotype you know about the hard-boiled private investigator. The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett is where those came from. I kept having to remind myself that this book isn't cliched. The book made the cliches.<br /><br />Sam Spade is a private detective and one day a woman comes in with a story about a missing sister. Then there are lies and more lies and a missing statue that is apparently worth a lot of money. You never know who's lying, what angle anyone is playing, or what's so great about this statue.<br /><br />Rather than do a real review, here are random thoughts:<br /><br />You keep trying to tell me Sam Spade is blond and I giggle every time because no, no he isn't. How silly Mr.   Hammett for you to get that wrong about your own character.<br /><br />Sam Spade doesn't just kiss a dame. He does it \"on the mouth\". Which I suppose is an accurate description of a normal kiss, except I kept picturing him giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Or that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND11bK47heM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=48s\">Coneheads kiss</a>. So you know, not sexy. But every time \"He kissed her on the mouth\".<br /><br />The female characters are pretty one-note. But then again all the characters are, so it's hard to get mad at Hammett for this.<br /><br />Speaking of, Sam Spade doesn't have a lot of emotion. Like at all. I'm not saying I expect a PI to be super touchy-feely, but I expect something beyond \"Oh that guy died. Meh, whatchya gonna do.\" And that's pretty much his tone for the entire book.<br /><br />Also, hey look! I finished another challenge book! I am in no way going to actually complete these 2 challenges, but I'm still trying.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Smooth+Criminals+challenge.jpg\" /><br />Title quote on page 190<br /><br />Hammett, Dashiell.

For those that skipped my review (how could you??) and thus missed the definition, allow me to share:<br /><blockquote>avant-garde, adj: This was after Alisa's show, the reverse-blackface rendition of Gone with the Wind, including songs from the Empire Records soundtrack and an interval of nineteenth-century German poetry, recited with a lisp. \"What does avant-garde mean, anyway?\" I asked. \"I believes it translates as favor to your friends,\" you replied.</blockquote> And this reminded me of a ridiculous production of Pericles I saw and have decided must be shared.<br /><br />Back in my freshman year of college I was taking a Shakespeare's Tragedies class and we were given the assignment (along with free tickets) to see a production of Pericles done by the A.R.T. I did not know what I was in for. Rather than explain to you the plot, or try to dig up my review, let me tell you the bits and pieces I remember. I want to note it's really not important you know the plot of the play to appreciate these. I'm not sure the director knew it.<br /><ul><li>Woman wearing panties, the pelt of a Muppet, shoes that bordered closer to \"stilts\" than \"platforms,\" and nothing else.</li><li>A little girl dressed in all white carries a huge gold beach ball onto the stage. She takes a step, throws the ball high in the air, catches it, repeat. Until she's across the stage.</li><li>Pericles wears what appears to be a thong made out of a bed sheet. </li><li>A person in a tan body suit, a pink sarong, and a gorilla mask dances across the stage</li><li>GIANT PIRATE PUPPETS</li></ul><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pericles9a.jpg\" /> Just as Shakespeare imagined it. <a href=\"http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/node/1278\">Photo by Richard Feldman</a>  My Backgrounds of English &amp; American Litg prof came to the play as well and I sat near him because he's all kinds of awesome. He sorta looked like a garden gnome, but as an average sized person and he spoke ancient Greek. At intermission he asked what I thought of the play. I tried to come up with a nice way of saying \"I think I'm too sober to understand what's going on\" and as he saw me struggle with a response he goes \"Well, is it worth what you paid to see it?\" I stopped and said \"Free? Yes, yes it is worth exactly that.\" He laughed and agreed.<br /><br />My Shakespeare prof did not agree however. Apparently the reviews the class handed in were a collective \"WTF did I just see?\" and she chided us that we were the MTV generation and should be used to random things happening. I never really followed what she meant, and she certainly didn't appreciate my \"Muppet pelt\" comment which made it into my review. Looking back now I realize if I could have worked animated gifs into the paper, I probably would have.<br /><br />I feel like avant-garde theater is a way to mess with pretentious people. Because it definitely seemed like they were trying to see how much they could get away with before the audience goes \"OK WTF was that?\" And apparently for my Shakespeare prof, they didn't hit that wall.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I couldn't find any pictures of the Muppet pelt or monkey mask. However, I did find that other picture above, which captures what I remember this play being like. There are<a href=\"http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/node/1278\"> more pictures on the site</a>, and you can even see giant gold ball in one of them, just to prove I'm not completely making those points up, although it's someone other than the little girl holding it.<br /><br />This was made up of various Greek tragedies, The Illiad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, The Bible, some Plato and some other stuff I've forgotten/blocked from memory. In case you were curious. You probably weren't.

On that trend, I finally picked up David Levithan's The Lover's Dictionary.<br /><br />The format is so original, but I'm sure you've already heard how it's set up like a dictionary, with the story slowing revealing itself through the definitions. You never get the full story. You don't know everything that happened with the rocky relationship within the pages. You don't even know the main character's names (they're referred to only as \"I\" and \"you\"). The definitions are in alphabetical order, you know, like a dictionary. Which means the story isn't in chronological order. Because of this, the book is interactive in a way. Sure, you're watching the plot unfold like a typical, albeit unconventional, story, but because of the structure you're trying to fill in the holes. A definition on page 132 calls back to a definition of page 18 that gives that part a whole new meaning. It's a book to read and re-read. Which is easy to do because you can finish this book in about an hour.<br /><br />The format could easily get  gimmicky, but Levithan keeps that from happening. Maybe because the format fits in with the story. The \"I\" character is writing out his feelings about the relationship by using definitions, and it feels like he's writing it out for himself. Because of this and the fact that he already knows what's happened, there's no need for the story to focus on what happened when. Instead the focus is on what each word represents for the relationship, whatever the time<br /><br />I'd gone back and forth on reading this book for awhile. I'd pick up the book, put it back, and then the next time in the store pick it up again. This time I finally decided to read it after reading the first definition. So I figured I'd share some of my favorites<br /><br />aberrant, adj: \"I don't normally do this kind of thing,\" you said. \"Neither do I,\" I assure you. Later it turned out we had both met people online before, and we had both slept with people on the first dates before, and we had both found ourselves falling too fast before. But we comforted ourselves with what we really meant to say, which was: \"I don't normally feel this good about what I'm doing.\" Measure the hope of that moment, that feeling. Everything else will be measured against it.<br /><br />avant-garde, adj: This was after Alisa's show, the reverse-blackface rendition of Gone with the Wind, including songs from the Empire Records soundtrack and an interval of nineteenth-century German poetry, recited with a lisp. \"What does avant-garde mean, anyway?\" I asked. \"I believes it translates as favor to your friends,\" you replied.<br /><br />ineffable, adj: These words ultimately end up being the barest of reflections, devoid of the sensations words cannot convey. Trying to write about love is ultimately like trying to have a dictionary represent life. No matter how many words there are, there will never be enough.<br /><br />And here's the review from <a href=\"http://www.entomologyofabookworm.com/2012/08/book-review-lovers-dictionary-by-david.html\">Kerry at Entomology of a Bookworm</a> that actually got me to want to read it.<br /><br />Title quote from page 210<br /><br />Levithan, David.

And said better. I didn't read this when it first came out and everyone was raving. It was described as YA lit and a romance and fantasy and other things that don't normally catch my interest. But then so many bloggers I like had good things to say that I was curious. When I saw the new paperback version on sale I decided to give it a try. I'm so happy I did.<br /><br />The book is mostly about atmosphere. It's about the Le Cirque des Reves, a circus that is only open at night, that shows up with no warning, and is far beyond what any other circus is. There are acrobats and contortionists and magicians and fortune tellers and lion tamers and everything you'd expect at a circus, but to the nth degree. And more. And all in blacks and whites and shades of grey.<br /><br />There are characters of course. It's not all set pieces. There are the old rivals Mr. A. H and Hector Bowen/Prospero the Enchanter. There are their students, Marco and Celia, bound together in a competition. There are the twins Poppet and Widget born in the circus. Bailey and Herr Thiessen, regular patrons and more of the circus. The characters are there to give the story a plot, but the circus is the star and the parts of the book that are the best.<br /><br />There is a love story between Marco and Celia but it's a love story that is tinged in sadness. They are in a competition they don't really understand that they were forced into as children. Tinged with sadness is a good way to describe the entire story. Even with the spectacle and the beauty and the magic there's a feeling of melancholy throughout.<br /><br />This isn't the best book I've read. I can't say it made me think deep thoughts. But it was a book I didn't want to put down. It's a story I wanted to immerse myself in. The characters may not be that well drawn but I didn't really want them to be too complex, too realistic. I wanted the book to stay simple and fantastic.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia the book is compared to Harry Potter and Twilight but I don't think either of those is accurate. Especially Twilight, although I'll assume that the comparison there is only to get people's attention and not because there are any similarities other than they both consist of words printed on paper. Other than the presence of magic, Harry Potter and The Night Circus don't have much in common either. Not only the time period but the feeling. For all its magic,  Harry Potter is set in a relatively realistic world. The Night Circus isn't. If anything the book is closer to Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell. Probably because of the setting and the time period, but it's more than that. It's the tone. To set the story too firmly in the real world would take away some of its power.<br /><br />Like I said before, I really liked this book. I wish there was more to read about the circus, even if the story with the characters was done and told.<br /><br />Oh and as for the romance, to quote <a href=\"http://bookriot.tumblr.com/post/29422524822/the-night-circus-its-the-most-romantic-story\">Book Riot quoting Leslie Knope</a><br />\"It's the most romantic story ever.

Heldt lists Nicholas Sparks as one of his influences on his Goodreads page, something I absolutely should have checked before agreeing to review this because Sparks is listed on my review policy (put up long after I accepted this book to review and before I started reading this) as someone I avoid. That is my fault. I also should read reviews more carefully. See normally, if there's a book that I'm considering reading I'll skim reviews. I don't want too much to be given away. The skimming in this case lead me to believe a blogging buddy Deb at <a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/back-in-time-to-wwii-a-review-of-the-mine-by-john-heldt/\">The Book Stop</a> liked this book more than she did. Again, my fault.<br /><br />The Mine is about Joel Smith, a college senior, who accidentally travels back in time to 1941 and ends up falling in love with one of his grandma's sorority sisters. Romance is not my thing, so a romance has to be super extra special for me to like it. Being funny helps, because I forgive a lot if something is funny. But the book isn't funny (which it isn't trying to be, so it's not a failure) and I really didn't like the characters. Especially the golden boy Joel.<br /><br />About half-way through the book I started arguing with, just, everything. Every line the characters said I wanted to scream at them and be like \"But that makes no sense! Are you insane? Can you even hear yourself?\" And of course I end up sounding like the crazy person. I'm sure at some point the arguments I was having were out of spite because, as I said, I HATED the main character and by association, most of the other characters. Because our protagonist Joel is SO PERFECT. He's charming and handsome and smart and athletic and a natural salesman (the best Mel Carter has seen in 15 years) and he can use his future knowledge to make very specific bets on past sporting events and NO ONE thinks it's weird when he repeatedly wins every single betg. And while he's a geology major at college (which he's awesome at) his real love is history, specifically US history right before and when the US joins WWII and isn't that convenient, he just happened to end up there? Every person he meets loves him and/or wants to be his BFF. He was salutatorian instead of valedictorian in high school, so I suppose that's his flaw. The more the book talked about how AMAZING Joel is, the more I wanted to punch him or set him on fire every time he showed up. And given he's the main character, that happened a lot. <br /><br />The other characters aren't so <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue\">Gary Stu/Mary Sue</a>-ish, but they're flat. Especially Grace, the angelic (see what he did there) woman that Joel falls in love with. There just isn't too much to her other than she's perfect and beautiful and has a sort of troubled past, but not really all that troubled (and pretty glossed over, even though the characters make a big deal about it for one second and not again). The outline for Grace was there, but not the flesh.<br /><br />Because I never connected with the characters, I never connected with or believed the love story. Joel and Grace said they loved each other and that there was passion and all, but I never saw it. Grace said she was torn between Joel and her fiance (not a spoiler, the first time you see Grace she's getting engaged) but she never actually acts torn. Joel randomly says he doesn't want to mess with the past, but then forgets all about this (and any idea that maybe he wants to go back to his own time) when he actively goes after Grace.<br /><br />The writing is clunky at times. You know what Heldt is going for, but it doesn't quite work. Or sometimes the logic is off. A turn-of-phrase doesn't work or the characters behave in a way that makes no sense. This does mark the first time I used the notes feature on my Kindle, because I got to the point where I had to write down the stuff I was yelling at the text. Some examples:<br /><br />\"He knew he would pay for eating raw fruit, and nothing but raw fruit, on an empty tank.\" - is this a thing? Do people get sick if they eat raw fruit on an empty stomach? (I tried Googling it and it says some people might get sick if they have an allergy or the fruit is contaminated. But the allergy is never brought up and while he is eating fruit from the garbage, he's not making the point here that eating garbage fruit will make him sick.)<br /><br />\"By the way, Miss Vandenberg, seeing as you're kidnapping me and all, don't you think you should tell me where we're headed?\" - Dammit no! That is not how kidnappings work. The kidnappee isn't entitled to know where the kidnapper is taking them. I GET that he's joking around but the line makes no sense.<br /><br />So if you DO like Sparks, you'll probably have a different reaction to this, but I don't think I was really the right audience for this. Because I'm sure there is an audience for this. If you like Sparks or other romance authors, this is probably in your alley, and you can forgive some of the problems that I had. Or you won't even notice the problems. Maybe it was just me being nitpicky because I couldn't get into the story. The time travel isn't dealt with too much.<br /><br />One character at one point goes \"Gee, it's odd you are winning all these sports bets with very specific predictions\" but when he goes \"I guess I'm lucky\" the subject isn't broached again. I thought we had something there.<br /><br />He never really exhibits this love of knowledge of the time other than knowing that a) Pearl Harbor happens, b) the US joins the war, c) many Japanese-Americans are sent to internment camps. Of course if you happened to leave pre-Pawn Stars History channel on one day, you'd have this same amount of knowledge <br /><br />Title quote from location 5695. You said it, not me.

The E train had all sorts of delaysg that made me miss 2 of my other trains, which means that I was getting on the LIRR at the time I'm normally already home. Which meant instead of the lovely grilled chicken Caesar salad I was planning on making, I wanted Chinese food. It's my go-to \"I'm in a bad mood and want comfort food\" option. On our way back from picking up the food, there's a segment on the radio about \"How to tell if he's ready for marriage\".<br /><br />I want to again repeat, I was already in a bad mood. It was subsiding because 1) I was done with the commute and there was Chinese food sitting in the back seat and 2) Cracked apparently knew I was about to have a crappy day so put out a <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-true-stories-that-will-restore-your-faith-in-humanity/\">column about things that will restore your faith in humanity</a> that kept me from stabbing anyone on the train. But despite that, I wasn't in a unicorns and rainbows and sunshine place.<br /><br />Right at the start of this thing I'm annoyed. If he's ready for marriage? Cos the woman just is? That's her natural state of being? The guy needs to be talked into it by the woman. I hate you, lady who came up with this list. So she gives the clues that aren't that interesting and frankly, if you need to be told them, you probably need this expert since one of the tips is \"He changes the topic whenever you bring up marriage\". But the thing that extra annoyed me, was her closing remarks afterwards.<br /><br />She said roughly \"If you've been together for a year and there's still no talk of marriage then he doesn't want to marry you. After a year, what more is there to learn?\"<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=UopCq.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/UopCq.gif\" /></a></center>Boyfriend+ looked at me and started laughing as I let out a string of expletives, because I'm super eloquent when annoyed and tired.<br /><br />Boyfriend+ and I have been together for almost 8 years and just got engaged a month (or so) ago. Now, I know this is longer than most people so I'm not suggesting EVERYONE needs to do that. But what more is there to learn after 1 year of being with someone? Just one year? I still had loads to learn. And at the 1 year mark we were still in college. I was all kinds of not ready for any sort of marriage then. And I was the one holding things back. When we told my mom about the engagement she hugged Boyfriend+ first. Twice. When I feigned annoyance at this she said \"I figured you were the one who was holding out anyway.\" at which point I had to go \"well...yeah...\"<br /><br />Some couples know after a few months that they are not only meant for each other but meant for marriage. Because you need to be ready for both. And sometimes those things don't happen at the same time.  So shut up expert lady. <br /><br />To everyone that guessed my first wedding post would be a complaint, YOU WIN. You should get a cookie or something. I should also point out that this is my first post cos we haven't actually done anything for the wedding yet. But hopefully I'll have a post about the ring up in a couple weeks! So see, there will be happier posts.<br /><br />I get emails, text messages AND follow the subway on Twitter so I can see about these delays. Of course, most of the time I hear about the delays long after I've already gotten on the ill-fated subway car. And I have no service when I'm there so it means after I've already missed all my trains and I come out of the subway do I finally get a bunch of messages about these delays. Which makes me want to throttle the MTA that much more.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:40+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:40+00:00","published_at":"2012-09-09T14:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e285dde22fdcf0004da","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"wedding","slug":"wedding","url":"/articles/tags/wedding"}]}]},{"id":"53224e285dde2264190005b1","title":"I'm neither \"pro-women\" nor \"anti-men.\" I'm just \"Thumbs up for the six billion.\"","slug":"im-neither-pro-women-nor-anti-men-dot-im-just-thumbs-up-for-the-six-billion-dot","url":"/articles/im-neither-pro-women-nor-anti-men-dot-im-just-thumbs-up-for-the-six-billion-dot","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/How+To+Be+A+Woman+cover.jpg\" />I want to be BFFs with Caitlin Moran.

I'm also pretty sure that I first heard of this book from Laura because Moran is British so the book came out over there WAY before I could get it. I just jealously sat by reading reviews not only about how great this book is but also <a href=\"http://harperperennial.tumblr.com/post/26346637944/caitlin-moran-and-jenny-lawson-the-interview\">an interview between Moran and Jenny Lawson</a> (aka <a href=\"http://thebloggess.com/\">The Bloggess</a>, aka <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">Let's Pretend This Never Happened</a> author). So there was a lot of build up. It not only met but exceeded expectations.<br /><br />Moran writes about feminism from her personal experiences. Her chapters use that personal experience as a jumping off point to talk about larger topics, such as the pervasive porn culture in the chapter I Start Bleeding!g. And she is hilarious. It's not like reading a textbook about feminism, it's like talking to your friend about all the shit that being a woman entails. And part of that is not backing down from difficult topics. She talks about sex and marriage and abortion in a very straightforward, very honest way. An honest and hilarious way. Because that's the reason I would want to have these conversations with her (or in this case cos it's a book, listen to her talk). She can take a serious topic, keep it serious and thought provoking but crack you up. I think people are much more receptive to deep ideas when they're laughing. Your defenses are down and you don't even realize what you're taking in and suddenly BOOM, feminist.<br /><br />Her main point, her main moral is that you should just be polite. Be nice. Sexism? It's not nice, don't do it. Because ultimately everyone is just trying to get along. Thumbs up for the six billion, indeed.<br /><br />I already want to re-read this. I try to underline passages or mark down pages I want to talk about, but with this book I didn't really do that. Because I couldn't break myself away for 3 seconds to actually get the post-it and mark the page. So I've been flipping through it trying to find examples or ideas of what I want to talk about and I keep having to stop myself from finishing the page or the chapter. I feel like I haven't said too much here, so you should probably go read Laura's review. Or you could just go read this because this is the best. <br /><br />One quick thing for Americans checking this out. As I mentioned, Moran is English so there are English-y moments. My copy however was clearly meant for the American audience, as it explained things like Wombles as a footnote. So don't worry about not understanding some references because the message is universal. And kick ass. Everyone appreciates kick ass.<br /><br />I've had the hardest time writing this. In part because writing about  a book I love is 1,000 times harder than writing about a book I hate or  was lukewarm about and also because the TV keeps distracting me, and of course I  could go to another room or something, but that's not going to happen. I  will continue to write this and watch the VMAs while I try to figure  out at exactly what point did all of the music start just sounding like  noise. Then I'm going to chase some kids off the lawn.<br /><br />Her chapters are all SUPER EXCITED like that, based on (I assume) the way she wrote in her diary when she was young. <br /><br />Title quote from page 128<br /><br />Moran, Caitlin.

I mean I guess summer technically goes until September 21st and it is still hot out (or at least stupid humid) but that doesn't matter because September = Fall = no more Summer. Le sigh.<br /><br />So I only read 3 books in August. Or rather, I only read 3 new books. See it was Moonstone readalong time (which was 8 kinds of awesome) but that meant there were times when I read the assigned chapters and, not wanting to go over, found myself without my other book to read. So I ended up reading other stuff I had on my Kindle. So I also re-read most of How To Be Black and Attachments. That's my excuse for having such paltry stats this month.<br /><br />ALSO, I had a wedding update post that I was planning on posting on Sunday. And instead of posting it I...didn't. I got distracted by I don't even know what but it wasn't being online, so that will get posted this upcoming Sunday.

I would firstly and foremostly(?) say that this as been stupendously fun. And yes, Wilkie gets some credit for that because that man can write a mystery. But most of that has come from everyone playing along and being the definition of awesomeg with all the gifs and the comments and everything. You guys rule. And if you didn't get a chance to play along this time I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />Now onto the last part of The Moonstone and there's going to be spoilers because MYSTERIES ARE FINALLY SOLVED.<br /><br />I went with that title quote because it could have served as the subtitle for this book. Except that would have been all spoiler-y, so good choice on Wilkster's part in not doing that.Whoever guessed that Dr. Candy drugged Franklin, ten points! And he didn't do it for any awful reasons. He didn't even want to embarrass Franklin. He just wanted him to admit that sometimes you need medicine and thought drugging him with opium would be the best way to prove that. Alright, so maybe not the BEST idea but nothing sinister in those motives. <br /><br />Rachel never gets to be our Marian probably because a) we never get to hear HER narrative and b) she was like 18 and needs to stop being a teenager to reach Marian levels of greatness. But there is hope for her. Because how sweet was it when Jennings told her \"oh hai, so Franklin was high as a kite that night and honestly didn't know what he was going. I'm going to do a whole experiment that's really not that sound to prove it so...\" and before he could finish she's like \"I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!\"<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=yvJY1.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/yvJY1.gif\" /></a></center>She just wanted the littlest excuse to believe that Franklin didn't do it. Or did it but didn't know he did it at least.<br /><br />Anyone else think Jennings was going to be evil? Especially when he startled Franklin leaving the doc? Way to teach me not to judge a book by it's cover, Wilkie. And instead he's SO SWEET and SO TRAGIC. I wish we got to learn more about him and the things he did and his love.<br /><br />In a small way, I kinda don't blame Godfrey for taking the diamond. Because of course he's the one who took the diamond to London. But he was having all these money problems and Franklin literally HANDED HIM THE DIAMOND. Maybe he even convinced himself it was fate.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=PVWMi.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/PVWMi.gif\" /></a></center>That doesn't make what he did right and that doesn't make him less of a douchenozzle for the whole \"trying to marry Rachel for money\" thing or \"probably defrauding those lady charities\" things. Yeah, he deserved jail and a lifetime of loneliness but not smothered to death.<br /><br />And Cuff comes back! Although he doesn't really do too much other than perform his little detective magic trick. Writing down who he THINKS stole the diamond in an envelope to be opened later. Guess what, Cuff. WE ALL THOUGHT GODFREY DID  IT. All that gardening has made you soft, sir.<br /><br />One last thing. The Indians got their Moonstone back. Happy endings for everyone! Except Godfrey. And Rosanna. And Lady V. And Limpin' Lucy. And Jennings. OK so happy endings for some. Death for a bunch of other people. But Franklin &amp; Rachel get together and they have a baby because Robinson Crusoe said so.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rYT0YvQ3hs\">In both the hot dog and space version of the word</a>.<br /><br />Title quote from page 210, location 6728<br /><br />Collins, Wilkie.

This week they're asking for our Bookish Confessions. Here goes<br /><br />1. I don't go to the library - I know I should. But I don't. I had a library card for the Boston Public Library back when I was a freshman at school. And not since. I like owning my books instead of borrowing them, though I'm considering trying out the library for Kindle books. We'll see if I get around to that since step one is \"finding a library and getting a card\".<br /><br />2. I've read the entire Twilight series - Not only did I read it. I own it. It sits on a shame shelf, sorta hidden, on a bookshelf in the hallway. I read it in a week. Because everything that has been said about it (it's got horrendous writing, stupid characters, an AWFUL moral lesson especially for girls) is true and it's also addictive as hell.<br /><br />3. I never get rid of books - Hence the whole hiding the Twilight books thing. I'm just about out of bookshelf space (not space on my bookshelves, but places to put more bookshelves) so perhaps I'll have to do a book purger sooner rather than later.<br /><br />4. I'm a bit OCD when it comes to a book series - If I have a series of books, I want them to all look the same. Know why I didn't read Catching Fire right after finishing The Hunger Games? Cos it wasn't out in paperback yet and I have HG in paperback so OBVIOUSLY they must match. My Harry Potter set is cobbled together but still makes sense to me. So books 1, 3, 5 and 7 are the normal American cover trade paperbacks. Book 4 is American cover hardback. Book 2 is some mass market paperback I got in Rome. Which mean I had to find book 6 in a similar vein so I bought a used copy of the \"adult\" cover, which luckily just has a spell book on it and isn't actually HP porn.<br /><br />5. Sometimes the movie is better than the book - <a href=\"http://sarahsaysread.com/2012/08/28/top-ten-tuesday-bookish-confessions/\">Sarah said this too</a>, but I'm repeating it because it's true. Lord of the Rings books, I wanted to love you, but sorry, the movies stole my heart.<br /><br />6. I don't dogear pages. Or write in books. But I'm jealous of those that do - Sorta jealous anyway, because it's way easier to just fold over the page instead of always making sure you have a bookmark (or ticket stub, or whatever) on you. And it would be way easier if I underlined quotes in the book so I could find them later instead of just trying to remember where they were. And inevitably forgetting.<br /><br />7. If I can't pronounce a character's name, I make up my own - I do this for pronounceable names as well, though usually it's a case of misreading it once and deciding I like mine better.<br /><br />There's probably more but I can't think of them at the moment.

So, yeah... <br /><br />So this is just Jane Eyre. Sort of a retelling. Actually, more like someone (in this case Livesey) took a detailed outline of Jane Eyre and then wrote a story based on that. Then nominally set it in the 1960s except not really. I mean the story claims to be from then but the style doesn't fit. The main character is surprised and sort of confused by the telephone. Like as an invention. And I GET IT, she's supposed to be poor and didn't have access to nice things. But she lived with her uncle and aunt who seemed to have enough money to have a phone in the late '50s/early '60s. And she went to a boarding school where maybe SHE wasn't allowed to use the phone, but it was a thing there. Or was Scotland really late to the whole \"telephone\" thing?<br /><br />I like re-tellings of stories, even if the original story is something I'm not crazy about. But this isn't really a retelling. There's nothing new brought to the material. It's just Jane Eyre that is sometimes set in the '60s when the author remembers that's when it's supposed to be taking place. Oh and Gemma Hardy/Jane Eyre is originally from Iceland so you can plainly see this is an entirely different book and you should absolutely read this instead of just re-reading Jane Eyre. Grahme-Smith used entire passages from Pride and Prejudice when writing his book but that works as a retelling because he changed the story. By adding zombies. This could have really benefited from something supernatural. Or having Gemma act like a girl from the '60s and put a modern twist on things instead of randomly remembering that record players were a thing then, so we should mention them and OH, it's a whole new book!<br /><br />To give the book some credit, I am not the intended audience. Maybe if you LOVE Jane Eyre and want moar. Moar. MOAR! this will be the perfect book for you. For me it was very, \"Why am I doing this?\"<br />To answer that question: The book was free and I don't like DNF-ing. Besides, finishing this means I can bitch about it here. Besides, it is a quick enough read. And when I bring a book with me on the train I don't have too many options other than \"stare out the window\" so I figured I may as well read it.<br /><br />gSpoilers below. But about a really boring part of the book that should have been more interesting and failed. There, now if you don't read the stuff below, you know the gist.<br />You know how in Jane Eyre the reason Jane can't/doesn't marry Rochester at first is cos of the whole secret crazy wife in the attic thing? You remember how that was an actual scandal? Livesey missed that part. There is no arsony secret wife. There is no secret wife or previous wife or anything. Which at first, when there was NO mention of fires or whatnot, I thought \"It's fine. My problem with Rochester always stemmed with how Bertha was treated. Maybe I'll like this guy better.\" But we still need a scandal, something to drive Jane/Gemma away from Rochester/Sinclair so she can wander into the most boring part of the novel and find herself. The scandal here: more than 20 years earlier Mr. Sinclair and one of his friends/kids that worked at the family estate changed names for a couple years so Sinclair could join the RAF and convince his father he was brave. The other guy, Seamus, took Sinclair's place as a Bevin Boy working the mines and agreed to the switch because Sinclair offered up his sister Allison. Which at first does seem bad except in this case \"offered up\" equals \"put in a good word for the guy, since Allison already likes Seamus, and also talk to his dad about what an awesome son-in-law Seamus would make\". That is the scandal. That's it. Allison ended up dying due to a drug overdoes which would seem scandalous, except that the book says was not-at-all an effect of this arrangement. I'm pretty sure I mumbled \"Oh you have got to be fucking kidding me. That is the scandal? That?\" Maybe she tried to make Sinclair less of an ass than Rochester but she went so far the other way that I'm wondering why is this even a thing that was hidden. Or mattered at all?<br />Seriously, how did she manage to make the most interesting part of Jane Eyre so boring? Anyway, spoilers contained<br /><br />Title quote from page 304.

Are you excited? You should be. Unless you aren't playing along in which case these posts are probably annoying to you. Sorry about that. Anyway, onto Wilkie!<br /><br />First up, we get MOAR CLACK!<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m3umt4GN5l1ro50vlo1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m3umt4GN5l1ro50vlo1_500.gif\" /></a></center>I thought we were done with her after the last section but she's back for more. After Lady V's death Rachel goes to hang out with Godfrey's family cos apparently Rachel must be guarded at all times. And for whatever reason she invites Clack to hang out with her, which is a win for us, but I can't figure out why exactly she wants her there. Other than we need Clack to tell us what happens during this scene because there is BIG NEWS. (Also the opium.)<br /><br />Remember how we ended the last section all going \"Rachel and Godfrey are engaged, whaaaaa?\" Rachel has come to her senses and broken off the engagement and with no reason. Well no reason she'll tell anyone, because being stubborn is her thing apparently. Godfrey's dad is NOT having this and the scene is all tense and angry and he's face is going red and there's a lot of yelling. Clack is there to break the tension though with a tract! She apparently carries tracts for all occasions and his occasion calls for \"Hush, for Heaven's Sake!\" You know all that frustration everyone felt about her but were too nice to say? Daddy Godfrey isn't too nice. He calls her an \"impudent fanatic\" and \"Rampant Spinster\" and kicks Rachel out of his house. Don't worry though, because Mr. Bruff agrees to take her in and also Clack has decided she'll leave Rachel a whole bunch of tracts in her will.<br /><br />Next we move into Bruff's narrative and we don't get too much here except the knowledge that those three Indians that I keep forgetting about are still after the diamond and they found out that they're going to have to wait a year because it's currently being used as collateral for a loan. We also learn that SOMEONE wanted to take a look at Lady V's will not long after she passed and that SOMEONE proposed to Rachel because that SOMEONE is Godfrey! Because we were all totally right that Godfrey should not be trusted. Bruff tells Rachel about this and Rachel breaks off the engagement and now we're finally getting some answers.<br /><br />And we're about to get some more answers because our next narrative is by Franklin! We learn what's in Rosanna's letter and what she put in the Shivering Sand! Except everything we find out causes more questions and we all need more grog.<br />Rosanna really was in love with Franklin and she was totally neglectful of Lucy and my dreams were crushed a little.<br />It was a nightgown in the Shivering Sand. The nightgown with the pain smear. And that nightgown belonged to....FRANKLIN! Whaaaa?<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m8mqg28mt71qd7w31.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Whaa?\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m8mqg28mt71qd7w31.gif\" /></a></center>No seriously, what? Cos Franklin says he must have done it because I mean, there's his nightgown with the stain so irrefutable evidence right there. And he just doesn't remember it.<br />Rachel broke it off with Franklin and refuses to speak to him because she SAW HIM steal the Moonstone.<br />But they still want to be together! But they can't because she sees him as a thief and he knows he didn't do it and has to prove it to her and then they walk away from each other and the section we're supposed to read ends! BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_m76jaxlTis1qmgw1m.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_m76jaxlTis1qmgw1m.gif\" /></a></center>How is this going to play out?

Not for any good reason. And I actually haven't really been putting off this review specifically, so much as I've been lazy writing non-Moonstone thingsg. So when I pulled this up and said \"I'm going to write this thing, dammit\" I thought I already had something written. Maybe even half written. I looked at my draft and here's what I got:<br /><br />Augustus Waters is a manic pixie dream boy.<br /><br />Still, fact, but not exactly letting me off easy tonight. Ah well. I'll get back to that comment, but first some introduction.<br /><br />I haven't really read that many reviews about John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. I knew OF it because I spend time on the internet looking at book blogs, so I can't not know about it. But I heard the buzz words \"YA\" and \"cancer\" so I skipped over it. Then during Armchair BEA I won a copy from <a href=\"http://hawthornescarlet.blogspot.com/\">Laura over at The Scarlet Letter</a>, which was awesome and gave me my chance/excuse to read it.<br /><br />In case you don't know what The Fault in Our Stars is about, well first off Hi! How are you? Glad you could crawl out from under that rock. Hope it's not to bright out here. But second it's about a teen with terminal cancer. It's also a teen love story because it's YA so OF COURSE there's going to be a love story thrown in there. Will the female character wonder what anyone could ever see in her while the male character is practically perfect in every way (except, you know, cancer) and worships her? YUP. Is it pretty predictable and the characters aren't that fully developed? You bet. Was it emotionally manipulative? Did I mention the terminal cancer? Did I still enjoy it? Yeah, I did.<br /><br />Back to the first and only thing I wrote down while reading this book: Augustus Waters is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl\">manic pixie dream boy</a>. The film critic that came up with the term describes it as \"that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.\" In this case it's a soulful young lady, since Augustus is the boy and our main character Hazel is a girl but same thought. Think of Augustus as Natalie Portman in Garden State Zooey Deschanel in, just, anything. He shows up at her \"I'm a teen with cancer\" support group meeting (not for himself but for a mutual friend) and they are instantly attracted to each other and he gets her to quit being quite so depressed about that whole \"I'm going to die way sooner than most people\" thing.<br /><br />Alright, so I haven't said too much positive about this yet, but I did say I enjoyed it. And even though the book is predictable and emotionally manipulative, I let it slide because it made me laugh. The book is first person from Hazel's point of view and she's far wittier than most teens I know but that's fine because she says stuff like this<br /><blockquote>Then I found myself worrying I would have to make out with him to get to Amsterdam, which is not the kind of thing you want to be thinking, because (a) It shouldn't've even been a question whether I wanted to kiss him, and (b) Kissing someone so that you can get a free trip is perilously close to full-on hooking, and I have to confess that while I did not fancy myself a particularly good person, I never thought my first real sexual action would be prostitutional.</blockquote>So yeah. Stuff like that means I overlook the scenes that are there to make you feel all the sad. Because the book did make me cry and then I got angry at it for making me cry because it was SO OBVIOUS that was going to happen and still it got me. You bastard.<br /><br />I didn't LOVE it as I gather much of the internet loved it. But I did like it. It wasn't life changing but I am happy to have won a copy and read it.<br /><br />But seriously, Moonstone is the best.<br />Don't you love it when people ask themselves questions? Are you picturing Seinfeld right now?<br />I don't know any teens, so I'm going off memory from when I was teen.<br /><br />Title quote from page 24<br /><br />Green, John. The Fault in Our Stars.

Heads up to those not playing along, there will be spoilers. However, please enjoy the GIFs!<br /><br />Before I get to anything else I want to say this: Miss Clack wants in Mr. Godfrey's pants. <br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lplnc9ovQF1qg6de7.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lplnc9ovQF1qg6de7.gif\" /></a></center>I wrote my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/whatever-happens-in-house-robbery-or\">last Moonstone post</a> after finishing the assigned section, which seems like the logical way to do things. However SO MUCH HAPPENED that I ended up blathering on about the plot and missed out on lots of the amazing things that I had wanted to write about but forgot when the time came. So this week I've decided to write down a bunch of stuff as I'm reading it so hopefully I'll forget less of the stuff I want to say. Why yes, I could make sure to just focus on one part instead of trying to cram a bunch in here, and thus make a well thought out post. But I'm going to go with the random spewing of thoughts that will make for an incoherent mess. As I do<br /><br />Rosanna died???<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=vELB6.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/vELB6.gif\" /></a></center>I thought the shivering sand was going to be our ominous Woman in White lake but nope, turns out to be an actual danger. OR IS IT? I mean, we're just assuming Rosanna is gone, based on those footprints Cuff found. And based on that suicide note she left about doing just that. But still, I want to see a body. I think it's very convenient that \"What the Sand gets, the Sand keeps forever.\" And what did she chain down into the sand? The Moonstone seemed like a good guess to me but I guess not.<br /><br />Rachel is still being Rachel-y and refusing to help or talk to anyone and is basically acting like a pain in the ass. Cuff tells Lady Verinder and Mr. Betteredge (who needs to be there so he can tell us what happens) that essentially Rachel's got some debts that she NEEDS to pay or there will be busted kneecaps (implied, or whatever the Victorian version of that is) and she actually has the diamond. Lady Verindar and Betteredge vehemently disagree. Now I do think/hope Rachel actually has more going on than what we're seeing so far. I still don't think she's our new Marian.<br /><br />We leave Betteredge's narrative to head over to Miss Clack's and she is the most sanctimonious stick-up-her-ass brat so her narrative is equal parts painful and AMAZING. She's that awful person that talks about what a good Christian she is and how leaves people helpful literature (tracts) about how they're dressing like a (Victorian) slut titled \"A Word With You On Your Cap-Ribbons\" and is that a real tract? Can someone please find that and share because I want to read that.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said the ever proper Miss Clack wants in Mr. Godfrey's pants. Trousers. He is everything perfect and he thrilled her when he would talk about \"our prospects and trousers.\" Granted, the prospects and trousers in question were part of a clothing drive for the needy, but that does not change how much Miss Clack liked talking about trousers with Mr. Godfrey. But Mr. Godfrey loves Rachel, who is SO BENEATH him, Miss Clack can't even stand it.<br /><br />We also learn Lady Verinder is very ill but she doesn't want to tell Rachel what's wrong. She does tell Miss Clack which was a major misstep on Lady Verinder's part, but it does give us a fantastic scene where Miss Clack leaves a bunch of religious books hidden around the house for Lady Verinder. And when they're returned because, you know, awful-person, she spends the time copying out passages from the books so she can leave letters around the house. Easier to hide I guess? Plus it gives Miss Clack the opportunity to sneak around the house and listen in on a conversation between Mr. Godfrey and Rachel. Of course this also gives her the opportunity to hear Godfrey propose to Rachel and have Rachel agree and oh the horror, the HORROR.<br /><br />There's also stuff about the Moonstone but since I've already babbled enough, I'll let other people talk about everything else.<br /><center><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lu4lrz4wXO1qztwte.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Photobucket\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tumblr_lu4lrz4wXO1qztwte.gif\" /></a></center><br />Title quote from page 83, location 2767<br /><br />Collins, Wilkie.

And I wanted to read something else that would count towards my challenges. And I wanted it to be free. So I went with H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. I didn't know much about the story other than the whole Orson Welles radio-broadcast thing. Also I already own a copy of this book that was my dad's. One of the reasons it was important when I was downloading this book that it be free.<br /><br />I see how this was done as a radio news story. It sort of reads like a news report even though it's a first person narrative of an alien invasion. It's a pretty straight description of what this guy saw when Martians landed in England. There isn't a lot of narrative to get in the way of \"just the facts\".<br /><br />I wish there was more emotion in the story. But it's more like \"these aliens came and then they SHOT EVERYONE WITH HEAT RAY LASER BEAMS gPEW PEW. Then there's some quiet time while we walk somewhere else and OH NO, THE ALIENS ARE BACK AND NOW THEY CANISTERS OF BLACK DEATH SMOKE WHOOSH\". OK, maybe emotion is the wrong way to describe it. There's not a lot of character development I'm saying. Especially given this is a first person story and I know the characters as \"main guy\" \"main guy's wife\" and \"main guy's brother\". There are a couple other characters and Wells may have even given them names but I don't remember them cos the characters aren't really that important. They could be anyone.<br /><br />It's one of the original alien invasion stories although I can't say I've read too many other alien invasion stories. I have, however, seen Independence Day, so I'm pretty much an expert on the genre. There is the first strange landing, where people are curious about this cylinder from space. Then there's the violence as the aliens attack. Things seem impossible for humans, who are no match for the superior alien weapons until suddenly the tides turn.<br /><br />This next part has some spoilers. Kinda. You're prob fine to read this, but in case you want to go into this knowing nothing, skip ahead<br />My favorite part of the book happened when the narrator and a curate were trapped when one of the Martian cylinders mostly buried the house they were hiding in. They can't escape because the only way out would require them to go right by the aliens. There's dwindling food and the curate slowly starts to go mad. Especially when they seem the alien feeding, which involves sucking the blood out of a living human. Maybe because this was on of the first times in the book the narrator slowed down and instead of describing the havoc the aliens were inflicting we got to see what this invasion actually does to an individual. Even then, there are still scenes that would have been nice to see but were mostly skipped over. Like the narrator knocking the curate unconscious to keep him from alerting the aliens that they're there. Instead of hearing the narrator's growing desperation as he tries to keep the man quiet, we get this:<br /><blockquote>As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.</blockquote>Days are going by as they're both trapped in this prison, not knowing if they'll be found or starve to death and our narrator is trying to stay sane and keep the guy quite but eventually he knocks the guy out. There is this day long struggle about this and instead, we get one sentence about how he punched the guy so hard he quit making noise.<br />Spoilers contained. Though really, you're probably fine to read it<br /><br />Another detail that was lost on me, a bunch of English cities were stepped on but unless you have a map handy (or you know, are from there) all this city listing will be sort of meaningless. Probably because I'm a self-centered American. Maybe if they were American cities/towns I would have cared more. I would have at least had a an idea of where they were. And yes I realize I could have checked a map. I also could fluently learn another language or take up heli-skiing but those things don't seem to be happening either.<br /><br />One last detail, Wells mentioned bunnies a lot. My Kindle says there are 6 separate mentions of rabbit which I guess isn't that much but more than I expected to see. And not mentions like \"and then the Tripod stepped on a rabbit.\" They're references that essentially equate people with rabbits. Or else how would a rabbit view humans. For example<br /><blockquote>The bare idea of this [alien feeding tactics] is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.</blockquote>I'm not smart enough/too lazy to examine what the bunny/people references could mean so instead I'll just giggle at the picture of intelligent rabbits. Like Alice's white rabbit. But disgusted at people eating meat and also running from an alien invasion.<br /><br />This book counts as my <a href=\"http://www.sarahreadstoomuch.com/2012/01/challenge-link-up-post-19th-century.html\">19th Century read for the Classics Challenge</a>.

Or rather, first post once we have all read the first section and can really appreciate what Wilkie is doing. And it's so exciting. Heads up, this is going to contain all sorts of spoilers and probably non sequitors.<br /><br />The story begins very Indian Jones-esque as we learn about the theft of a sacred Hindu (Hindooooo) stone called the Moonstone and you can practically hear someone yelling<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/in+a+museum.jpg\" /> or temple But the Moonstone, a diamond the size of a bird's egg, does not stay in the temple. Instead it ends up in the hands of a Colonel Herncastle, who's sort of a douche. If you didn't get that from the whole \"stealing sacred stone\" thing. His family hates him and refuses to have anything to do with him. When he dies he leaves the stone to his niece Rachel. Is it a peace offering? Is it to pass the curse to the family that hates him? Who knows? I don't yet. But I'm so excited to find out!<br /><br />As is Wilkie's style (which I can say after reading only 1 Collins book) the story is told as a set of narratives from different characters, writing out everything they can remember about the incident. Betteredge is the head servant (I guess, I don't understand servant hierarchy) and we get to hear his side of the story first. He meets up with Mr. Franklin Blake, Rachel's cousin (and suitor..eww) who is bringing the stone to the family. He was followed by a trio Indian jugglers and a little British boy that is able to see the future, so long as he has a special ink poured into his hand and the jugglers (actually Brahmin priests!) say the proper incantation and do you hear how amazing this is??<br /><br />Mr. Franklin doesn't give Rachel the stone right away. It's supposed to be presented to her on her 18th birthday and Mr. Franklin knows all about the curse on the stone and about the jugglers that had shown up before he arrived. He and Betteredge decide that the thing to do is put the stone in the bank and see what happens. If nothing out of the ordinary occurs, it's probably safe to give it to Rachel. Apparently future seeing random Indian jugglers and their little British boy is old hat for this house. Rachel and Mr. Franklin spend a lot of time decorating a door, and please someone tell me if that is code for something else? Or implied something else? Were they really just painting a door for a month plus? Anyway, the only person acting strangely is one of the maids/servants Rosanna Spearman, but she always acts strangely (staring a quicksand that is apparently right near the Verinder homestead) so yeah, all normal here.<br /><br />Rachel and Mr. Franklin finish painting the door just in time for Rachel's birthday and since the Indian guys haven't shown up again Mr. Franklin decides it's alright to give her the giant diamond. She gets it and wears it  and there's much oohing and ahhing.

I wish we could hang out and I'd listen to you make bitchy comments about, just, everyone. But instead, I will have to enjoy your work. And enjoy I did.<br /><br />I've only read one Wilde book before this, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotton was my favorite character. My friend argued that Lord Henry was actually an incarnation of the devil. Maybe. But he's just so much fun. Anyway, I point him out because The Importance of Being Earnest is like an entire cast of Lord Henrys. At least what I remember of Lord Henry. What I'm saying is I LOVED this play.<br /><br />The full title is The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People. John Worthington (Jack) lives out in the country but tells his ward and servants and everyone else he lives with that he often has to come into the city to visit his troubled younger brother Ernest. His friends in the city all know him as Ernest. His friend Algernon Moncrieff finds out about his little ruse and is delighted to hear his buddy is a \"Bunburyist\" as well! Algernon gets out of hanging out with his Aunt and cousin by pretending to visit a sick friend of his named Bunbury. Jack refuses to tell Algernon where his country home is or about his life there in the slightest. Given Algernon's personality, it sort of makes sense to keep his country life private. But Algernon may soon be family, since Jack wants to marry his cousin Gwendolen. Except Gwendolen only wants to marry an Ernest (which she thinks Jack is) and hates the idea of marrying someone with any other name. Seriously? Any name other than Ernest? Dealbreaker!<br /><br />One day Algernon finds out where Jack's country home is and goes there introducing himself to everyone as Jack's troubled brother Ernest, who has mended his ways. Of course he's welcomed in the home. He is family after all. He is especially welcomed by Jack's ward Cecily. Cecily and \"Ernest\" (Algernon) fall in love instantly and they get engaged. Cecily also has the condition that her husband be named Ernest and couldn't imagine marrying someone with a different name. Especially Algernon. Gwendolen comes out to the country to visit \"Ernest\" (Jack) and then there is much confusion about who is engaged to Ernest and hilarity ensues. There's also a whole sub-plot about Jack being adopted after being abandoned in a suitcase at the train station.<br /><br />The basic plot is very Shakespearean-esque, what with all the mistaken identity stuff. Except it's far less complicated and far-fetched than the plot of, say A Comedy of Errors (see there are these 2 sets of identical twins that were separated when they were young and both sets find themselves in the same town...) It works better because it is simpler. It's also much shorter. My Kindle edition says it's 58 pages. This is a quick read and indeed I finished it part way into one of the legs back from Seattle to NY. And during my reading I kept elbowing Boyfriend+ saying \"Now read this line! Oh you have to read this part.\" I'm a joy to travel with, is what I'm saying. Here are some of the quotes I highlighted. Though I sorta highlighted the entire thing<br /><br />Algernon: If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night...<br />Jack: I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.<br />Algernon: I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.<br /><br />Lady Bracknell (Algernon's Aunt): Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.<br /><br />Gwendolen: I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.<br /><br />I could go on and on with quotes because I love them all, but I'll stop now. The one criticism I have is every character sounds the same. Every character has the same tone, same sense of humor, same snark, same cynicism. Which I LOVE but it doesn't exactly make for the most compelling set of personalities. However it's short enough, and the lines are so good that I didn't mind so much.<br /><br />And this is another challenge book down! This was my <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/11/smooth-criminals-reading-challenge-for.html\">Smooth Criminals</a> selection for \"Book written by a writer who did time\". This may be sort of a cop-out for this choice, given Wilde did time after the play was already on the stage but the category wasn't too specific and this still works.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Smooth+Criminals+challenge.jpg\" /><br />Title quote from page 55, location 873<br /><br />Wilde, Oscar.

I had downloaded The Importance of Being Earnest and The War of the Worlds but as I was sitting in the airport I thought \"I can't read those. I'm not in a classics mood\" and I started scrolling through my \"To Read\" shelf on Goodreads. I came across one of the first books I added on there, Elna Baker's memoir The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance. This was what I needed. Something light. Something funny. Something that would be good for a plane read.<br /><br />The story mostly revolves around Elna's life as a Mormon living somewhere other than Utah, mostly New York City. Which just terrifies her mother.<br /><blockquote>'Elna,' she said nervously. 'The first thing that will happen when you move to New York is, you might start to swear.' I wanted to say, 'Oh shit, really?'</blockquote><blockquote>'And Elna,' she said, pursing her lips and looking directly into my eyes, 'what would you do if a lesbian tried to make out with you?'...'I'd say, \"No, thank you...lesbian.\"'</blockquote>Now Elna's story doesn't involve her moving to NYC and breaking away from her Mormon faith and going nuts and all that jazz. As a matter of fact, a lot of the book involves her defending her faith to people. And she does a good job, at least in my opinion. You feel her frustration with other people and her religion, but also the trust she has in her faith. And I learned little things about it.<br /><blockquote>They think I'm Mormon because I haven't read enough books yet.</blockquote><blockquote>Mormons don't believe in hell. We believe there are three different levels to heaven, like how they divide A-list, B-list, and C-list celebrities. </blockquote>But really the majority of the book is about Elna trying to find love. As a Mormon. In NYC. Really just finding love in general. She does make out with just, a lot of people and her drawings of who she made out with and where in Manhattan are hilarious.<br /><blockquote>Normally this [a co-worker saying he wanted to touch her boobs] would be considered sexual harassment, but since Jeff was average cute, I let it slide. The whole \"Attractive Boy + Sexual Repression = Ethical Hypocrisy\" equation.</blockquote><blockquote>when you're in a relationship without the possibility of sex it feels more like you're flirting with your personal assistant. </blockquote>The book is very funny. I found myself smirking a few times, though never outright laughing out loud. Of course part of that could be I was reading it on a plane and trying not bug too many people. But this wasn't my most favorite memoir. Maybe because I recently read the last memoir I read was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">The Bloggess one</a> which had me crying I was laughing so hard. Maybe because I read the book all at once so I didn't have a chance to let it sink in. Maybe because I didn't have the same very religious upbringing so I didn't relate all that much. Whatever the reason, very funny book that I'm glad I read but (sorry <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Alice</a>) not one of my most favorite books ever.<br /><br />Update: I have left out a part of the book that doesn't really fit in with the main stuff (being Mormon, looking for love, living in NYC while being Mormon and looking for love, etc) but it was one of the best parts. For awhile Elna worked at FAO Schwartz in the section selling crazy expensive baby dolls of some certain type that I could look up but I'm lazy and won't. The dolls were featured on some realty show (again, could look up, but not) and got super popular and ALL the rich NYC ladies had to get them for their daughters. Specifically had to get the white babies, which the store sold out of. There were rows of Asian, Hispanic and Black babies but these people didn't want them. I mean what would the neighbors think?? (Seriously, one lady asked Elna this when she suggested the woman buy one of the Hispanic babies instead of waiting for a new shipment of the white ones to come in.) So yeah, it's mostly Mormon trying to find love in NYC, but also stuff like this sprinkled in as well.<br /><br />It was significantly cheaper to get to Seattle from New York by transferring in Dallas. I don't know why. That makes no sense, but that's what happened. <br />Every time I write out that title I have to look it up. If I don't, I leave out an adjective.<br /><br />Title quote from page 213, location 3306<br /><br />Baker, Elna. The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance: A Memoir. Dutton Adult, 2009.

But you know, with Moonstone characters, whomever they may be.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Moonstone+readalong.jpg\" />I've decided to go into this one like I did the last one, meaning I haven't bothered to look up a damn thing about this before I dive in. Last time it was because I didn't pay enough attention to the posting schedule. This time it's because I'm procrastinating. I did try to really study the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Seringapatam_%281799%29\">Siege of Seringapatam</a>, which Wikipedia does have a page on, so I don't have to make something up. However, military stuff makes my brain go \"oh this is the time I can quit paying attention\" so the details are mostly going in one ear and out the other. So here are the details that I can seem to grasp<br /><br />-The \"belligerents\" are the British East India Company and the Sultanate of Mysore and I can't help but go \"your sore what?\" and giggle because I'm a small child.<br />-They call it the Anglo-Mysore War but I like it the other way cos then I can giggle some more. \"Ow I've bruised my Anglo\"<br />-The Moonstone begins with someone stealing jewels from \"the legendary treasury of Tippu Sultan\" who was \"a short, fat officer\" although later in that same section it says he was about 5'8 which doesn't seem that short. He also had delicate wrists and ankles.<br />-Wilkie Collins has a huge forehead. I know, not about the siege and I talked about it last time but seriously, look at that. Look. At. It.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Wilkie+Collins.jpg\" /><br />I look forward to seeing everyone's thoughts and picking favorite characters and the gifs.

And I did. I do. Even after I started Darkness, Take My Hand I thought \"This is nice and all but I prefer Drink.\" I'm not sure at exactly what point that changed. But it changed. Now as I said, I still like A Drink Before The War but Darkness wins.<br /><br />Kenzie and Gennaro have another case. This time a friend of a friend is afraid she's being targeted by the mob. See she's a counselor/psychiatrist at a local school and one day this young woman comes in and is very nervous that her boyfriend, who is in the mob, is after her. The girl gives this woman the last name \"Kenzie\" and isn't actually enrolled into the school. Then she receives a picture of her son, but it's ominous because it's taken from far away and there's no note with it but the implication is \"We're watching you and your loved ones.\" And just like last time, a case that seems relatively straightforward at first turns out to be an insane and violent and dangerous journey.<br /><br />Lehane's stories often seem to be about the most horrible people possible. And the idea that these people exist not only as aberrations, but in huge numbers. His novels are mostly populated by awful, violent, hateful people, and you while reading him you can forget the world isn't so dark. And if your world is as awful as the one in a Lehane book, please seek professional help.<br /><br />Even the good guys can be evil. And it can be hard to rectify this as you find yourself cheering for a psychopath. Not the main characters, Kenzie and Gennaro. I'm not sure I could take the books if they were as awful as the people they're going after. They have a friend Bubba who is a violent psychopath. But, you see, he's our violent psychopath. (Yes, I'm including myself in this group.) For reasons that aren't entirely clear he is fiercely loyal to Patrick and Angie. It's a little like having a guard dog. A guard dog that has surrounded his house in strategically placed land mines and is an arms dealer. But if Patrick or Angie tell him to make sure no one hurts someone they care about, you can be sure Bubba will make sure that person is not hurt. Sure, he'll enjoy himself while he's beating up whoever tried to hurt Patrick and Angie's friends, and that's where you think that maybe you shouldn't be cheering him on. But then you remember what this pummel-ee was trying to do and you're like \"Punch him in the neck, Bubba!g\"<br /><br />Lehane's stuff is bleak. The stories are bleak. The worlds are bleak. But they're so good. I want moar. I want more Kenzie/Gennaro (and there's more in the series, so lucky me). I want more Lehane (and there's Shutter Island, so lucky me again). <br /><br />Side note but since I saw the movie Gone, Baby, Gone before reading any of the Kenzie/Gennaro stories I can't help but picture Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Patrick and Angie. Not a bad thing or a good thing, just something I couldn't break myself from doing and made me laugh a little when Patrick says he'd grown a beard. Probably because I also can't help but picture Casey Affleck as the annoying kid from Good Will Hunting and that kid can't grow a beard. Silly rabbit.<br /><br />I often say \"punch him in the neck\" because I watched way too much Kevin Smith when I was younger and Joey Lauren Adams yells that during a hockey game in Chasing Amy. Why am I telling you this? To tell you that since Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck are buddies and Ben Affleck's little brother Casey has a cameo in Chasing Amy AND he played Kenzie in Gone, Baby, Gone as I've already mentioned in this post. I'm just playing 6 degrees, is what I'm getting at. Also two posts about all the darkness that is a Lehane novel is a lot, so I needed to lighten the mood. <br /><br />Title quote from page 32<br /><br />Lehane, Dennis. Darkness, Take My Hand.

Well, at least since I read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/its-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never\">Gone, Baby, Gone</a> and both <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Ben </a>and <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Ellen </a>said \"You want more Kenzi/Gennaro? Read Darkness, Take My Hand\". Now you've probably noticed that this book is not Darkness. How very astute of you. But you see, I found a copy of both A Drink Before the War and Darkness, Take My Hand in a single book. And seeing how this one is the first in the Kenzi/Gennaro series, I figured start at the beginning.<br /><br />Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are friends and business partners, private investigators, operating out of the neighborhood church in Dorchester, a working class neighborhood just outside Boston. The pair are hired by state politicians to locate a cleaning woman who previously worked at the state house and is suspected to have made off with some documents. It seems simple enough but of course if it was simple enough it would be a very short story. Instead the pair find themselves in the middle of a gang war and a government scandal.<br /><br />Lehane's style is brutal in a beautiful way. It has graphic, violent moments, but they don't make up the whole novel. They are shocking but they aren't there just to shock you. They make a point about how evil some people can be. Or can become. He doesn't seem to write books that make you feel great about your fellow man, even if they have a \"happy\" ending. And I feel safe telling you about that \"happy\" ending because you can at least be sure that Kenzie and Gennaro make it out of this book alive. You know, because this is the first in a series and the series would be awkward if the main characters were both killed in the first book. But \"the main characters in a series of books don't  die\" is pretty much the happiest thing I can say happens.<br /><br />The book was great. It was compelling, disgusting, upsetting, sometimes funny (in a gallows humor kind of way), and moving. It's a book that made me want to keep going, to know what happens next. If you've read any Lehane before, I probably don't have to try to convince you to check this out. If you haven't but have seen the movies (either Mystic River or Gone, Baby, Gone. I haven't seen Shutter Island so I can't speak to that one) then I also probably don't have to convince you to check this out. You know what you're in for so I can just tell you this is fantastic. And I always like to see where series characters start out. If you've never read Lehane before or seen movies based on his books, just know his stuff is dark, his stuff is violent and his stuff is good.<br /><br />Title quote from page 113<br /><br />Lehane, Dennis.

Jacobs. If I wasn't already familiar with his earlier book <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/youd-be-surprised-at-how-many-days-can\">The Know-It-All</a> I probably would have skipped over this. But KIA was hilarious and this was on sale so how could I turn this down? I couldn't. Exactly.<br /><br />It's not so much a single cohesive narrative like The Know-It-All was. It's more a series of experiments over a period of time. Some of those experiments are going on during his other books and they take place over a few years. And each chapter/experiment is sort of its own stand alone story. Which is fine because the chapters are hilarious. In one instance he tries Radical Honesty, in another he pretends to be a celebrity, then he does everything his wife asks. It's such a random selection of experiments. And it's fun to see someone that's no me try them. Because with his experiments there is something to be learned from each of them, but if you were to actually go to the extent he does, you're going to probably go insane. Or be that guy that tells everyone the truth all the time. And not just the truth but just says whatever pops into his head at any given moment. He gets slapped a lot, is what I'm saying.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was \"My Outsourced Life\" where he he outsourced everything to an Indian company that acts as a personal assistant. Actually he had two assistants to cover everything from writing memos and scheduling dinner to bickering with his wife and reading bed time stories to his son. (It's less cynical that that sounds.) Because really, having a personal assistant sounds fantastic, even if they are halfway around the world.<br /><br />Overall a funny and quick read and one I'm sure I'll pick up again when I want something light. It's a good get-out-of-reading-slump book. It didn't make me want to actually try out any of his experiments myself but it was fun to see him act like a human guinea pig. I'll just learn through his experiments. Plus, it makes me want to read his other book The Year of Living Biblically. Moar Jacobs please.<br /><br />Title quote from page xiii<br /><br />Jacobs, A.

Nothing I was actively looking for but if I happen to come across it I would check it out. Well I happen to come across it when it was on the remainder table of my local bookstore and since I want to read more non-white people I decided now was the time to pick it up and try it out.<br /><br />This was different than I thought. Told in the second person, the main character Changez is telling an American his story about living in America pre and post 9/11 and the woman Erica he loved. The frame story is in the second person, so Changez is talking to you, although in this case \"you\" is a large nervous American man. It's a great device and it doesn't feel hokey. It feels natural, even if it's hard to believe a stranger would actually share so much or even that another stranger would stay and listen for so long. Or maybe I'm just not friendly enough to want to sit for hours and listen to a stranger's story. But of course, there is the feeling that this American in Lahore is more than just a tourist.<br /><br />Changez tells \"you\" about his time at Princeton an later when working at a prestigious consulting firm in New York City. He quickly becomes a star employee and things seem to be going well with Erica. But then things start to fall apart. Before they met Erica had lost her best friend/first boyfriend and has never really recovered. And then while working in the Philippines Changez sees a news report about the 9/11 attacks. He starts to question his place and his loyalties as tensions in the middle east grow. He feels guilty about living in America while his family is in Pakistan and under the threat of war.<br /><br />There is, as the blurb on my cover tells me, \"enormous tension.\" However I can't say it's \"more exciting than any thriller I've read in a long time\". Tense yes, thrilling eh. At least not in the conventional term of a thriller. It's not a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller. I wasn't constantly holding my breath wondering what would happen next. But it was a story that kept my attention. I found myself both sympathizing and repulsed by Changez. It was an interesting story and one I'm glad I read, though I can't say that I found a new favorite here.<br /><br />Title quote from page 1<br /><br />Hamid, Mohsin. The Reluctant Fundamentalist.

I didn't even realize that was a thing that happens. And once learning that is a thing I still don't blog with the hope of getting asked to review a book. Which I'm guessing some bloggers and many publishers think is just silly. At least based on the stories from this year's Book Blogger Convention. But this blog is my hobby, it's not my job. And having books that I have to read and review puts this in job territory. So I mostly stick to reading, reviewing and discussing my own books, thankyouverymuch.<br /><br />That is not to say that I NEVER accept review copies. Just that I normally don't. If someone reached out to me with a book that sounds like something I would have bought myself I certainly welcome a free copy in exchange for a review.

And because of the layout of my blog (which I heart) the page will be on the side of the screen and could be easy to overlook.

Has it helped?<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with YA paranormal romance. It's just not my thang. But there are LOTS of other blogs out there these authors can/should be reaching out to.

Unfortunately, Butler's work is apparently in some sort of Disney vault because I had been having the hardest time finding it, either in the book store or as an ebook. I've also been complaining about how <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/may-reading-wrap-up\">my reading has been too white</a> so the thought of reading another white guy was making me sad so I checked again for Kindred and lo and behold, it was available! And on sale! And I'm so happy.<br /><br />This was amazing. It's another book I want to just shove in everyone's hands. I was going to say I'd like to drop copies on people from a blimp but that would probably cause a lot of lawsuits, so maybe you could all save me the legal trouble and just get your own.<br /><br />Dana Franklin, a black woman living in California in 1976 one day finds herself transported to Maryland circa 1815. Not the best time for a black person to find themselves in.g Dana is connected to Rufus Weylin, the son of a slave owner and a distant relative. Whenever Rufus is in trouble he unconsciously summons her to him. She is only able to go back to her own time if she believes she's about to die. While she can be in Maryland for days, weeks or months, she's only gone from California for a few minutes or hours. So here you have the science fiction aspect that you'd expect from Butler. But think of this form of time travel more like King's in 11/22/63. (Or really King's is like Butler's cos her book came out first, but I assume in general the King book is better known.) It's there but the story doesn't dwell on it, and indeed it never ever addresses exactly how it's happening. Because that part isn't important. Dana's time as a slave on a Maryland plantation is.<br /><br />Butler gives us a slave narrative but by having a modern woman go back and experience slavery first hand we get a modern context to what is going on. We have someone who knows what's going to happen with slavery but learns what the day to day existence is like, not just in terms of the work or living conditions, but in what being treated as a subhuman does to a person. And not only what these people go through, but how easily it's accepted by everyone, slaves and non-slaves. The story is heartbreaking. You see people beaten, families sold apart, woman raped. But Butler keeps the characters complex. It would be easy to just make the Weylins, the slave-owners, ruthless awful people. But they aren't. At least not entirely. There is more to Rufus and even his mother and father than just that single note. And the relationship between the various slaves on the plantation and the Weylins is more complicated than just pure hate. Dana is also surprised by this<br /><blockquote>Strangely, they seemed to like him [Rufus], hold him in contempt, and fear him all at the same time. This confused me because I felt just about the same mixture of emotions for him myself. I had thought my feelings were complicated because he and I had such a strange relationship. But then, slavery of any kind fostered strange relationships.</blockquote>This could have been a melodrama. It could have been a story about slavery that was simplified to just black and white issues but instead Butler allows in shades of grey. People are people, and  they are both good and bad within a single person.<br /><br />I'm sure while reading this I made ridiculous faces because there are so many parts to make you gasp and wonder what will happen next. Because on top of being a wonderful book full of complex characters, it's also a page-turner. Butler, how do you do it? So really, just read this.<br /><br />I can't help but think of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY\"> Louis CK's \"white people\" bit</a>, about how black people can't get in a time machine and go back much further than the '80s. If you haven't watched this yet, just go ahead and click that link. But do it after you read this post because otherwise you'll get sucked in and end up watching all the Louis CK videos. At least that's what happens to me.<br /><br />Title quote from page 229/location 2300<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E. Kindred. Beacon Press, 2004. Originally published 1979.

When I do have something to snack on, like a bag of gummy bears or pretzels, I eat ALL OF IT. Which is not  usually a good thing.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/not+now+chief.png\" /><br />What is your favorite drink while reading? Water. I'm a big water dude. Maybe some sort of pretentious coffee during the winter.<br /><br />Do you tend to mark your books as you read, or does the idea of writing in books horrify you? I tried so hard to do marginalia when I was in school, because my teachers told me how useful it was. (I went to a Catholic high school where we had to buy all of our books anyway.) Now, I only mark important things I want to remember for re-reads.<br /><br />How do you keep your place while reading a book? Bookmark? Dog-ears? Laying the book flat open? Like Red, I use a bookmark or just try to remember. Or try the always awkward try-to-use-the-dust-jacket trick. If I don't have a bookmark, I try to end on a chapter break.<br /><br />Fiction, non-fiction, or both? More fiction than not. I try to make myself read non-fiction on a semi-regular basis, but I usually end up reading long-form articles in Instapaper rather than non-fiction books.<br /><br />Are you a person who tends to read to the end of a chapter, or can you stop anywhere? Hey, I just answered this. I try to end on chapter breaks whenever possible, but it's not always feasible. Many times, though, I need a reason to stop reading, and a chapter break provides that.<br /><br />Are you the type of person to throw a book across the room or on the floor if the author irritates you? No. Do people do this? I threw a cell-phone across a room once because an ex irritated me, but that's another story.

I never used to do this (it's shocking how many words I can only define by context/using it in a sentence) but since the Kindle and Instapaper make this so easy, I do this a lot more often. It's probably the only thing I miss when reading dead trees.<br /><br />What are you currently reading? I'm focusing on the Challenge again, so I'm working my way through The Three Musketeers. Expect a much more comical review than Inferno. Mostly because I keep drawings parallel between it and Archer. I'm also partway through 11/22/63, which I was supposed to read and talk to Red about. (Sorry!) <br /><br />What is the last book you bought? I put myself on a book-buying moratorium recently, until I read more of them, so the only books I've bought have been for the challenge. My Name is Red, 3 Musketeers, Inferno, a few others. My wife bought <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">Let's Pretend this Never Happened</a>, which I'll probably read next, so maybe that counts. I'm not quite sure how the marital book rules work yet.<br /><br />Oh, wait. I did buy Infinte Jest. I forgot that I'm a glutton for punishment. (See the picture 3 questions above.)<br /><br />Do you have a favorite time/place to read? During the summer, in the late afternoon, in my window seat or on the deck, overlooking the bay. (I mooch off of my parents' vacation home. Wouldn't you?)<br /><br />Do you prefer series books or stand alones? I used to love reading series. I absolutely devoured the Redwall books as a child, and loved other series as well. Now, though, Harry Potter aside, I try to diversify what I read. Many times, the later books in a series disappoint me, so I'm content to treat a book that I love as a stand-alone, sequels be damned<sup>[2]</sup>. There are exceptions, though. Currently, I am five-eighths of the way through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle\">the Baroque Cycle</a>, but that's a multi-year thing. I have a not-so-tiny man-crush on both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz\">Gottfried Leibniz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nealstephenson.com/\">Neal Stephenson</a>, though, so when one writes 2700 pages about the other, I break the rules.<br /><br />Oh, and if Susanna Clarke writes sequels to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/think-of-me-with-my-nose-in-book\">Strange &amp; Norrell</a>, I'll jump on that one too, in zero time.<br /><br />Is there a specific book or author you find yourself recommending over and over? The books I probably end up recommending the most are Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell and The Remains of the Day, an engrossing story of a British butler post-WW2 by Kazuo Ishiguro. I also like to recommend Italo Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveler to my literary friends. (That's you, dear blog readers. It's a weird little postmodernist book, alternating between a larger second person narrative and some related short stories. <a href=\"http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/winter.htm\">Try the first chapter</a>, and see if it catches you.)<br /><br />How do you organize your books? (by genre, title, author\u2019s last name, etc.) I could spend hours here, but I won't. First, I've got fiction and non-fiction book shelves, which are then sorted by between my books and my wife's.

I suggested A Dirty Job to him but he decided to go with Domestic Violets. However, since A Dirty Job was already off the shelf I decided I may as well read this. Besides it's one of the top Moore books I recommend so I may as well re-read it and make sure it's as good as I remember.<br /><br />Guess what, it is! I wasn't really too worried about not liking it because Moore tends to stand up when I re-read him. But still, one can never be sure that first impression will hold up under multiple readings.<br /><br />A Dirty Job is about Charlie Asher, who has just lost his wife while at the same time gaining a daughter. And it seems a new-life calling in addition to his career as proprietor of Asher's Secondhand. He's a death merchant (think like Santa's Little Helpers, but for Death, capital D) Certain items in his show start glowing red, although only he can see. Then a copy of The Great Big Book of Death shows up. And forces of darkness seem to be mocking Charlie from the sewers. And things just continue to get weirder and weirder. I would like to point out here that when I saw Moore talk he said he wanted to combine horror and whimsy, because he was told those two things could never mix. I wouldn't consider this a scary book, but a combination of horror and whimsy sounds just about right.<br /><br />I haven't come across a Moore book that I dislike, but this is definitely one of the best ones. It takes place in his favorite city, San Francisco and features a couple characters from his vampire seriesg. And even with all the forces of evil and death merchants, it features Moore's signature humor. Especially about Beta Males (as opposed to Alpha Males). For example<br /><blockquote>While Alpha Males are often gifted with superior physical attributes--size, strength, speed, good looks--selected by evolution over the eons by the strongest surviving and, essentially, getting all the girls, the Beta Male gene has survived not by meeting and overcoming adversity, but by anticipating and avoiding it. That is, when the Alpha Males were out charging after mastadons, the Beta Males could imagine in advance that attacking what was essentially an angry, woolly bulldozer with a pointy stick might be  losing proposition, so they hung back at camp to console the grieving widows. (31)</blockquote>It's not just a hilarious book, but a touching one. The main character is Death so naturally he often sees people during their last moments. But please don't think of Charlie as Death (or at least a death merchant) anything like Death being the narrator of <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/first-colors-then-humans-thats-usually\">The Book</a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/im-always-finding-people-at-their-best\"> Thief</a>. Charlie is first and foremost a worried father, fretting over his daughter losing her mother and then having to deal with a father who has an...odd job.<br /><br />Writing about books I love always seems harder than books I hate or I liked but don't get gushy about. Hence the big quote up there because how better to convince you that this writing is awesome than by just showing you Moore? So yeah, read Moore. This one is excellent AND stands up to re-reads.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/it-was-as-if-vampirism-carried-with-it\">Bloodsucking Fiends</a>, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/you-shouldnt-just-kill-guy-without\">You Suck</a>, and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/saying-rawr-is-not-vampyre-thing\">Bite Me</a><br /><br />Title quote from page 103<br /><br />Moore, Christopher.

Yeah, I'm pretty clever.<br /><br />First up, Amazon is confusing me. And scaring me a bit. I recently got an email from them about The Elegance of the Hedgehog and if you liked that, then here are some other recommendations. Which is fine, and I have some other Amazon recommendations based on things DVDs I recently bought from them. But here's the thing: I didn't buy The Elegance of the Hedgehog from Amazon. I won it. The email from Amazon came right after I posted<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/i-realized-that-in-his-presence-i-had\"> my review</a>, but my blog isn't linked to Amazon. My Shelfari account is connected to Amazon, since Amazon acquired them at some point. Except I have been super slacking on writing reviews so I added Hedgehog to my Shelfari list awhile ago and moved it over to \"Read\" a few weeks ago as well. And yet this Amazon email comes the day after I post my review.<br /><br />I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by this. Everything is watched online, especially by big companies. But still, creepy. So has anyone else had this happen to them?<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Book+pile.jpg\" />Next up, Book Acquisitions. Normally I don't get a big haul of books. They sort of trickle in. My TBR pile is mostly in my head but this time it's an actual pile looking at me. Probably judging me too. \"You have all of us to read? And you need to get to work on those challenges? You really think you can finish all of that?\" My TBR pile is sort of an ass, apparently. Anyway, I figured I'd write to tell you some new books I will (probably) be reading in the future, maybe.<br /><br />The Mine by John Heldt - I agreed to review this book because it sounds interesting and Deb over at<a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/\"> The Book Stop</a> read and enjoyed it. Plus it's not a YA book which I seem to get loads of requests to review. I guess it's my fault for not having a review policy page. Maybe I should make one that says \"I probably won't read your book but maybe I will. Unless you're YA or romance or romantic-YA. In which case, it's best for all of us if you just move along.\"<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars by John Green - I won this one from Laura over at <a href=\"http://hawthornescarlet.blogspot.com/\">The Scarlet Letter</a>. I know pretty much everyone has already read and reviewed this and I'm sure I won't be adding anything new to the mix but don't care. There will be one more review to add to the pile.<br /><br />Measure What Matters: Online Tools for Understanding Customers, Social Media, Engagement, and Key Relationships by Katie Paine - OK so I also won this one, but at a work event. Well sorta work event. I was at a conference/class and I answered all the questions on the quiz right because I'm a super nerd so I got a signed copy of this.<br /><br />Native Son by Richard Wright -<a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\"> Brenna at Literary Musings</a> mentioned this as one of her favorite books so far this year, so when I saw it on the remainder table at my local indie I had to pick up.<br /><br />A Drink Before The War and Darkness, Take My Hand by Dennis Lehane - Another remainder find. But this one is even better cos it's 2 books in one. So instead of one book being $5, it's 2 books for $2.50 each! (That is the most complicated math I am capable of.) How could I leave this behind? Besides I've been meaning to read more Lehane, especially Darkness since both Ben at <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> and Ellen from <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Fat Books &amp; Thin Women</a> told me I need to check this out.<br /><br />My Life as an Experiment by A.J. Jacobs - Another remainder book. And I've already finished this one so I'll be getting to that review eventually. Right after I write ones for A Dirty Job and Kindred. But I liked <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/youd-be-surprised-at-how-many-days-can\">The Know-It-All </a>so when I saw this one on sale I decided why not, I'll give it a try. Plus Boyfriend said it looked like something he might like as well. So see, good investment!<br /><br />Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid - Another Brenna recommendation and the last literary remainder find. PLUS I want to read more non-white people so this is just helping me towards that goal. I also recently finished this one so you'll get that review right after the My Life one.<br /><br />Update!<br />I was apparently a bit premature with this post. See I also won some mystery books from HarperCollins during Armchair BEA and they just showed up today. I don't know these titles although some of the covers look familiar.<br /><br />With My Body by Nikki Gemmell<br />The Flight of Gemma Hardy by Margot Livesey<br />When We Argued All Night by Alice Mattison<br /><br />Also I updated the picture to be of the books instead of generic book pile. The only book not in there is The Mine because it's an ebook. And I suppose I could have added my Kindle to the pile, but would have really have improved anything?<br /><br />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:52+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:52+00:00","published_at":"2012-07-03T13:34:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e345dde2223b60000fd","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224e345dde22386700027c","title":"June Reading Wrap-Up","slug":"june-reading-wrap-up-1","url":"/articles/june-reading-wrap-up-1","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/June+calendar.jpg\" />June is now done and summer is super here.

But last time her review convinced me to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/halliday-seemed-to-expect-everyone\">read Ready Player One</a> and this time she GAVE me (or I won it, whatever) The Elegance of the Hedgehog so how could I not mention her again? Had to be done.<br /><br />I kept hearing about Muriel Barbery's The Elegance of the Headgehog but I didn't really know much about it. I knew it was French. The cover lead me to assume there was a precocious child involved. And that's really all I knew. But that didn't stop me from wanting to know more.<br /><br />So here's the actual plot. Renee Michele is the conciergeg at this super upscale apartment building in Paris. She's very smart but chooses to hide her interests and intellect so she'll be left alone but the pretentious and bourgeois tenants. She narrates the majority of the story which is nice, but there's a second narrator, twelve-year-old Paloma Josse. Paloma also hides her extreme intelligence also to avoid standing out so you can tell these two are going to find each other. BUT they need something to bring them together and that comes in the form of a new resident Kakuro Ozu, a refined Japanese businessman who sees Renee's and Paloma's true selves.<br /><br />It took me some time to get into it and connect with the characters, but once the Ozu showed up I was hooked. So I guess I needed Ozu to bring me together with Renee and Paloma. He's that fantastic, is what I'm saying. He's a gentleman, kind to all of the tenants, but he really connects with Madame Michele. He breaks through her shell and shows her that she can actually relate to another person.<br /><br />There's a lot of talk about philosophy and art and literature and also some Blade Runner. There are a lot of lines I could see ending up in a book of quotes. To the point where it sometimes seemed Barbery was more concerned with coming up with memorable lines than staying with the story. I can't decide if that's a bad thing or not. The story is still there, it's just sometimes hidden behind the eminently quotable moments.<br /><br />I should correct when I say it took me some time to connect with the characters. Because I never really connected to Paloma. She's <span>a little annoying, a little pretentious, and a lot tween angsty. A lot. This may seem like a spoiler, but it comes up very early so don't worry, nothing is ruined but she wants to kill herself on her thirteenth birthday. Because life is meaningless and she can't take the \"vacuousness of bourgeois existence.\" And I'm pretty sure you're allowed to smack people for saying things like that. Not the killing herself part but the Cure-lyric-ness of her speech. PLUS she doesn't just want to kill herself but she wants to do it by burning down her apartment (while her family is away). Because why just kill yourself when you could take down an entire building or even entire block because who knows how close these buildings are. I mean, how can they really stand the \"vacuousness of bourgeois existence\"? I was happy the majority of the book is from Madame Michele's point of view.  <br /></span><br /><span>I feel like I'm ending this on a negative note, but that's just because I didn't like Paloma. That doesn't mean I disliked the book. Or even that I wish Paloma was less...Paloma-y. She worked in the story, even if I couldn't stand her. And I liked Renee. And loved Ozu. It was too bad he didn't show up until about 1/2 way through the story. But that's OK because I just appreciated him all the more.<br /></span><br /><span>Overall the book is good and philosphy-y and French. So thanks Alice!</span><br /><br /><span>I didn't realize concierges are things at places other than hotels. So the more you know.</span><br /><br />Title quote from page 148<br /><br />Barbery, Muriel. The Elegance of the Hedgehog.

Enjoy!<br />Hi. It's Paolo. Remember me? I'm the guy who's supposed to be writing updates based on the books he's read in the Classics Challenge. You know, to give Red a <s>chance to watch Clueless</s> break from time to time. If you don't, just know that I'm a roguishly handsome yet erudite semi-blogger. (To be fair, I am my own harshest critic.) <br /><br />I dove head first into Inferno. It's an intimidating poem to start reading - any work with so many competing translations shouts, \"I'm a Classic. You heard right; that's a capital C.\" Of course, this is the Classics Challenge, and this is the translated work category. I should hardly be surprised. I settled on Ciardi; he seemed to be both well-recommended and easily accessible on the Kindle. Two pluses. <br /><br />For those of you who haven't read any of the Divine Comedy, a brief overview. First, Dante loved Catholicism (if not the Catholic Church of his time). You'd kinda expect that from a dude who's known for writing The Divine Comedy, but it infuses everything he does. The rhyming schema he invented, terza rima, has triplets in both line and rhyme: ABA, BCB, CDC, DED, EFE, and so on. (If you're having trouble figuring out what comes next, e-mail Red. She loves questions like those.) <br /><br />With me so far? Good. Now imagine a dialogue between two Italians. You don't have to speak the language; make up some representative giberish and you'll do just fine. Hear all those vowels at the ends of the words? This makes rhyming Italian[1] a lot easier than rhyming in English. Ciardi had a seriously uphill battle translating the Comedy with the terza rhima intact, so he punted. Or, to stretch the football analogy far past its breaking point, he punted on 3rd down[2]. So yes, there is a rhyming scheme in Ciardi's Inferno, but it's not quite the same. Instead, it simply goes AXA, BXB, CXC, etc. <br /><br />This is not do diminish the effort or accomplishment. Ciardia did a marvelous job making the rhyming work. This seems incredibly hard to manage in English, and it only rarely falls into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP5-qJSzDUg\">Princess Bride</a> territory. It definitely works, and feels like poetry to boot, but I found myself looking for a little more flow in the text. For the most part, I found the subject matter compelling, but I felt like I was still missing out on the much-lauded brilliance of Dante's work. <br /><br />Speaking of the much-lauded brilliance of Dante's work: dude needs an editor. I dug the concept, love the exploration of hell, found Dante and Virgil to be great characters, and found the first 6 (of 9) circles quite interesting. Then I still had 80% of a poem to go. Needless to say, the pacing was a little ridiculous. Perhaps the people in the inner circles were more interseting and deserved a more in-depth treatment, but it often felt like Dante changed his plan partway in. Further, Dante's editor would also have done well to tell him, \"Hey, dude, people are going to be reading this 600 years down the line. Nobody really cares about some petty noble in Tuscany[3].\" You'd think he'd have considered that. <br /><br />I'm not trying to be overly critcal, though. The pacing, obscure dead guys, and difficulty of transation are my only real complaints. Beyond that, I'd been exposed so much to intrepretations, applications, and other references to Inferno throught other works that a lot of it felt familiar. Still, it was really awesome to drill down deep into the source material. Even after translation, the poem retains a lot of it weight, and Dante manages to put enough horror into Hell for even a jaded 21st century interent person. <br /><br />If you've got a smartphone, I'd take the time to put Inferno on your ebook reading app of choice[4]. The individual Cantos (33 in total for Inferno) are short enough to read in those 5-to-10 minute bits of downtime where you're tempted to find a book, but don't have enough time to really read. I'd put it up there with Milton in the \"definite read if you care at all about religion's influences\" category. <br /><br />[1]Dante pretty much invented modern Italian (when he published The Comedy) by slamming together a number of the local dialects with some Latin. The poem was so overwhelmingly popular that it essentially established the rules of the language. Look into it from a better source than me - it's cool stuff. <br />[2]American football. Canadians, substitute second down. Europeans, he took a shot from midfield. Australians, he showed up to a prison riot with just a sharpened toothbrush.<br /><br />[3]A decent number of footnotes on Dante's contemporaries read, more or less, \"there's no real historical record of this guy\" or, \"this guy was a prominent politician of his time\" <br /><br />[4]Preferably one with a more adjustable font size.

Though I think I amused the Whole Foods worker yesterday when I made race car noises with my car while picking up groceries.<br /><br />So anyway, I saw this meme on <a href=\"http://sarahsaysread.com/2012/06/21/its-my-blog-and-ill-meme-if-i-want-to/\">Sarah's of Sarah Says Read</a> blog who got it from <a href=\"http://jillianreadsbooks2.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/my-reading-habits-a-meme-for-midweek/\">Jillian at A Room of One's Own</a> and on and on until you can't figure out where these things actually start but that's not the point. The point is, here's an excuse to talk (more) about myself and I'm taking it.<br /><br />Do you snack while you read? If so, favorite reading snack: I don't usually. Because I'll get distracted by the food and pay more attention to that then the book.  <br /><br />What is your favorite drink while reading? Yeah, I also don't normally drink either. I'm either reading on the train and it's probably best if I don't add a beverage to that equation, unless I really want to spill on myself and probably some innocent commuter. And then when I'm at home the table is slightly too far away so I have to actually lean forward if I want to put the drink down or pick it up. And that's way too much work.<br /><br />Do you tend to mark your books as you read, or does the idea of writing in books horrify you? The horror! The horror! I sorta wish I did write in books but then I know if I did and I looked back at the comments later I'd think \"Oh naive you. You had no idea what you were saying\" <br /><br />How do you keep your place while reading a book? Bookmark? Dog-ears? Laying the book flat open? Bookmark. Or just remember where I was. That's my \"I don't have a bookmark but I don't want to dog-ear the page\" method. Why yes, I did end up re-reading a lot of the same stuff over again cos I couldn't quite remember where I'd left off. How'd you guess?<br /><br />Fiction, non-fiction, or both? Both, but mostly fiction.<br /><br />Are you a person who tends to read to the end of a chapter, or can you stop anywhere? Wherever. I usually stop based on if the train is currently at my station. If I'm not commuting I try to go to the end of a chapter but if I find myself drifting I just stop wherever I am.<br /><br />Are you the type of person to throw a book across the room or on the floor if the author irritates you? I haven't yet. I don't want to mess up the book. Or with my luck I'd damage the TV or something.<br /><br />If you come across an unfamiliar word, do you stop and look it up right away? Pretty much never. And it's only \"pretty much\" instead of \"absolutely never\" because I sometimes will look up the word with my Kindle. But actually going to a computer and looking up a word? No, that's not going to happen. It should. I know I should probably look those things up but, again, lazy.<br /><br />What are you currently reading? Kindred by Octavia Butler and holy crap, is it good and difficult. I also started Slaughterhouse-Five but got distracted/realized I'd be reading ANOTHER white guy and decided I needed to do something about that. <br /><br />What is the last book you bought? Kindred. It has been crazy hard to find. And by that I mean the 3 times I remembered I wanted to read it while at a bookstore it wasn't there. And it just recently became available on Kindle. <br /><br />Do you have a favorite time/place to read? My commute because I don't have to do anything else. Nothing else that needs done and little to distract me. Well, less than normal when there's the computer and TV and people and food to distract me.<br /><br />Do you prefer series books or stand alones? Stand alone. I like some series (Thursday Next, I heart your face) but for the most part I don't end up reading the rest of a series.<br /><br />Is there a specific book or author you find yourself recommending over and over? Well Christopher Moore. I seem to tell EVERYONE to read him. But you guys aren't listening, so I need to keep repeating myself. Also you guys should read Jasper Fforde because he writes Thursday Next stuff and other series that are amazing. And yes, I know I just said I prefer stand alone books and this guy writes series but did you miss the face-hearting?<br /><br />How do you organize your books? (by genre, title, author\u2019s last name, etc.) They are currently organized by \"these books were all in a box together so they're on this shelf together\". Because this recent move took forever and I just put stuff on the shelves with the thought that I'd organize it eventually. And it will happen. Eventually. There's some order, leftover from the last time I organized them that transitioned to our current place based on how I boxed up books. So the Shakespeare is together. The books that are in my room (Moore, Fforde, other fav books) are still together. But that's about it.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:53+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:53+00:00","published_at":"2012-06-21T19:31:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e355dde2264190005c2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"meme","slug":"meme","url":"/articles/tags/meme"}]}]},{"id":"53224e355dde2264190005c3","title":"Not bookish but important","slug":"not-bookish-but-important","url":"/articles/not-bookish-but-important","body":"Last week <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/06/you-know-how-some-weeks-youre-like-but.html\">Alice posted about Cinderella Ate My Daughter</a> and included a video of Anita Sarkeesian of the <a href=\"http://www.feministfrequency.com/\">Feminist Frequency</a> talking about Legos and Gender. Not sure why exactly but then I decided to watch ALL THE VIDEOS Sarkeesian made, or at least the ones posted on her site. And if you go to her site (or Google her name or follow the links I keep retweeting) you'll see there was some battle going on.<br /><br />Some background if you don't already know:<br />Sarkeesian made a series of videos called Tropes vs. Women that are pretty sweet and look at certain tropes liked The Straw Feminist and The Mystical Pregnancy. Since those were pretty awesome, she decided to make a series that focused on Tropes vs. Women in Video Games. Normally she asks for donations to help pay for the research, production and general site upkeep but this time she decided to try Kickstarter to raise money. She was hoping to raise $6,000. And she reached that goal within 24 hours. And then the happy feelings ended. In her Kickstarter video she talks about wanting to look at different stereotypes in video games around female characters. She didn't say what those opinions were, just that sometime, in the future, she would like to voice an opinion about them. And a group of people flipped right the fuck out at this idea.<br /><br />She has received comments ranging from basic \"get back in the kitchen\" jokes to death threats, rape threats and all manner of hate. For having the audacity to suggest at some point she would like to talk about women in video games. Her Wikipedia page is still locked because of vandalism. The group keeps flagging her YouTube videos as \"terrorism\". And Sarkeesian responded in the best possible way.<br /><br />First of all, I want to reiterate that she was hoping to raise $6,000 and wasn't sure she could get that. The Kickstarter campaign closed today and she raised $158,917. I know she didn't do that so much as her 6,967 backers did but that is still awesome and needs to be pointed out. She's now expanded the scope of her project from 5 videos to 12.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Feminist+Frequency.png\" />But even better than that is Sarkeesian's reaction. First of all, she didn't back down. She didn't let the hate silence her, which was ultimately the group's goal. She didn't (from what I can see anyway) attack the people back. She responded to a couple comments but she didn't attack. What she did do was document the hate. She wrote a few posts about the harassment and they're up on her site. She has screencaps of the YouTube comments and her Wikipedia page. It's easy to dismiss awful comments (especially those on YouTube) as par for the course online, as a number of news sites point out. But it's another thing to actually read those comments. And by sharing those comments, she brings to light how bad it can be.<br /><br />Not only did she not back down, but the whole incident has been brought to the attention of several publications including Slate, Guardian, Globe and Mail, Wired, and Forbes. A number of blogs have written about her story as well. Because she didn't stay silent. Because she didn't delete the comments and take down the campaign.<br /><br />So this isn't a post about books. I realize I'm not even adding to the conversation by posting this. But I've been reading pretty much every story about this and A) I wanted to share the story and B) I wanted to say how amazing Sarkeesian is for not backing down. I can't wait to see the videos.<br /><br />Updated: to include a link to a story my friend Paolo posted in the comments. It's not about this case but another instance of PR people (for shame!) assuming boobs=does not like video games<br /><a href=\"http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/06/513794/\">I Can Be Just As Capable.

Dystopia. '80s pop culture. Sci fi. How could I not read Ready Player One by Ernest Cline?<br /><br />I really liked this book. Really liked it. I saw the book cover but knew NOTHING about it until I read <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/05/ready-player-one-full-of-shininess-and.html\">Alice's review</a>. I was drawn in. As in I-really-need-to-go-to-sleep-but-just-one-more-chapter drawn in.<br /><br />It's the future and the real world is so crappy that most people spend all of their time plugged into OASIS, which is sort of like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life\">Second Life</a> but to the nth degreeg. People go to school, work, and essentially live in OASIS, with brief breaks in the real world to eat and go to the bathroom. Halliday, the co-creator of OASIS, died and left his massive fortune to whomever can find the three gates hidden throughout OASIS. Some people have dedicated their lives to hunting for these Easter Eggs and one of these gunters is our main character Wade Watts/Parzival. Good thing he spent his time studying Halliday's favorite movies, TV shows and video games, mostly from the '80s. So it's a treasure hunt based on '80s pop culture and video games. ARE YOU EXCITED YET?<br /><br />OK so I used to play more video games, when I lived at home with my younger brother who loves all the games. Since leaving for college I've played less although I still heart The Sims and I'm sure I'll finish LA Noire any day now. But even with my limited video game love, this was still a super fun book and one I've already yelled at my brother that he HAS to read. I want to share this love with other people because this book was so much fun. I can't remember the last time I HAD to find out what happens next.<br /><br />It did have problems. The characters, especially the only female character Art3mis, weren't especially well fleshed out. And of course there was the problem that if you thought too hard about, really, any part of the plot the story sort of falls apart. But just don't do that. Because this isn't the book to make you rethink about the world. It's a book to entertain you. It's a book to make you go \"YES, a War Games reference!\" There isn't a huge amount about the dystopian real-life as most of the action happens within OASIS which I was a bit disappointing at first but I got over it pretty quickly as I got pulled into the quest.<br /><br />Read this. If any of those initial terms sound interesting to you, read this. It's super fun. It's not life-changing, it has it's problems, but it sucks you in. Oh and have I mentioned, it's fun.<br /><br />I know very little about Second Life. Actually most of what I know comes from an episode of the Office and some talk about advertising in Second Life.<br />There are technically other female characters, but the others that are there are so minor as to not count.<br /><br />Title quote from page 55, location 1091<br /><br />Cline, Ernest.

Now I don't actually have a huge TBR pileg so this means most of these end up being re-reads. Which is actually fine by me. I like re-reading. Sometimes it's like visiting old friends. Sometimes it's seeing if something I originally read stands the test of time. So I was scanning my shelves for something to read that would be very different from Emma. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/one-half-of-world-cannot-understand\">Not that I thought Emma was HORRIBLE</a>, I just struggled through the style and needed something that wouldn't be so much work. Which is how I stumbled on Branded: The Buying and Selling of Teenagers by Alissa Quart.<br /><br />At some point early in college I went through a \"advertising is evil and warping your mind\" phase. Actually, it started in high school thanks to a teacher who showed us a PBS documentary called The Merchants of Cool but it really came to a head in college when I read both Branded and Naomi Klein's No Logos (as well as a number of other titles that I no longer remember). Branded is about the advertising techniques used on teenagers and more than that, how advertising is affecting teenagers, not only in spending habits but in general development.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind with this book is the age. It's not THAT old BUT because youth culture shifts so quickly, the book did feel dated. By focusing on brands you have to mention those brands. Some brands which aren't a thing anymore, or at least don't have the hold on today's youths that they held in the early 2000s. I know Delias and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch are still things (I can't walk by A&amp;F in the mall without a potent odor reminding me I AM HERE AND I DON'T KNOW THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF COLOGNE TO WEAR) but they aren't as front and center in the world of teen fashion as they were when i was in high school. There was no Facebook or Twitter when this was published. Which is too bad because I think the conversation about how social media is affecting teen's perceptions of brands would have been very interesting. But alas, Quart is not a psychic.<br /><br />The book is split into 3 sections: Branding, Self-Branding and Unbranding.<br /><br />Branding focuses on how teens are being marketed to and how it's changing them. I especially liked the section on peer-to-peer marketing, which is essentially having teens work for the brand (though not for salary or anything, don't be silly) by giving the brand feedback and telling their friends all about how amazing X brand is. This section plays up the general insecurities teens have, especially the desire to fit in and be heard. In this case teens are being heard by the brand and their opinions are being taken seriously. It makes sense teens think of these brands as friends when the marketing liason is the one that listens to them and treats them like an adult. There's also the pervasiveness of branding in places like video games, such as Tony Hawk Pro Skater. (Remember, the book was published in 2003 and most of the references are from before that...)<br /><br />Self-Branding is looking at how teens and young adults internalize the marketing messages, through cosmetic surgery, steroid use, anorexia, \"Logo U\" (the self-branding to get yourself into one of the top colleges), and even the aura of celebrity that has infiltrated markets such as Sweet 16 parties, Quinceaneras and Bar/Bat Mitzvahs. This section argues how much further the intense teenage marketing goes. It's not just getting teens to connect with (and buy) certain brands, but actually change their physical and emotional self to fit a predetermined example of what they should be like.<br /><br />Unbranding is about the reaction to this branding and teens taking a stand against this threat. It's kids who are home schooled instead of going through traditional \"branded\" schooling, or even teens that stay in the public school system but hold rallies against the advertisements in their school.<br /><br />For the most part it's a good book. It brings up interesting points  about not only teens who view consumer goods and brands as friends but  the general commodification of teens.However it does have its faults. When Alissa is stating facts or interviewing teens, the book works nicely. When she puts her opinion in there, it seems heavy handed and awkward. I don't remember this bothering me back when I first read it, but this time around it was obvious.<br /><br />The other thing is she says mean things about Clueless, which you may have noticed I'm currently having a second love affair with. She talks about the sheer awesomeness of '80s teen movies and how that has been lost in a time of Bring It On, Clueless, and She's All That (again, published in 2003) when the popular kids are the stars and watching them go shopping or getting a make-over is the highlight of the plot. She acknowledges that Clueless is a satire but then says that most tweens and teens don't understand this and they'll just focus on how important it is to be popular, beautiful and have expensive things. LIES madame. Lies.<br /><br />But my main problem with the book is who she's talking to. This book could be sub-subtitled \"First World Problems\". Or at least \"Rich Kid Problems\". The issues faced are real but for the most part every teen she talks to is from the upper class and can afford to drop money on name brand gear like Gucci and Dolce&amp;Gabbana, whose families can spend $50k and up on a party, who go to the cream of the crop private schools and thus have the pressure to continue that trend and get into the most exclusive ivy league schools. It's not the sole focus but it's the majority. <br /><br />Not a physical TBR pile anyway. I have a fairly large (and growing) wish list tbr pile<br />Which a friend of mine got me on DVD one year for my birthday or Christmas or some gift giving holiday. Which I now have a desire to watch...<br />And now I work in PR because I appreciate irony. Or I'm a hypocrite.<br /><br />Title quote from page 35<br /><br />Quart, Alissa.

Well, more accurately, I needed a Classic Romance for the <a href=\"http://www.sarahreadstoomuch.com/p/classics-challenge.html\">Classics Challenge</a> and THEN I picked Emma because of Clueless. I want to mention this right up front: I liked Clueless better. But hear me out.<br /><br />If you're a semi-regular reader of this blog (or if you read my little About Me blurb) you'll know that contemporary fiction is my jam. But I really need to expand my reading beyond books that have been written since I was born.g Hence one of the reasons I signed up for the Classics Challenge. Sometimes I can get into the groove of different writing styles easily and sometimes it always stands between me and the story. The Woman in White was fine and I was on the edge of my seat during Marian the Ninja scenes. With Emma I could never get into the story. Maybe because it's less of a thriller, less sensational but I often found my mind wandering while I was supposed to be paying attention. I would say that I just can't do Austen, there's something about her style that keeps me at a distance from the story, but I was sucked into Pride and Prejudice no problem.<br /><br />I can't decide if knowing about the Clueless connection helped or hurt. Because I did spend a lot of time figuring out who was who, which scene from the book matched up to the movie, etc. Maybe the book would have been better if I didn't do that. But then again, it was fun to do that so I don't care too much.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Cluess+poster.jpg\" />If you follow me on Twitter you may have noticed a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alleyecarina/status/211119641492336640\">Tweet about a certain DVD</a> I received. I realized the only copy of Clueless I owned was on VHS which is cute of me and all, but sort of useless. So I bought a dual DVD Clueless and Mean Girls and then made Boyfriend watch Clueless with me the other day because can you believe he'd never seen it??? This is why he needs me. I was very happy to see that the movie is as awesome as I remembered it.<br /><br />So instead of actually reviewing Emma which I've been trying to do for days but have been failing, I've decided to talk about how Clueless relates to Emma which means I can spend a bunch of time talking about the movie instead. So this will be sort of spoilery, but really, you should already be familiar with Clueless.<br />Clueless and Emma or a bunch of connections you probably already know about if you've seen/read both of these, but that I'm going to write out anyway like I made some big discovery<br />Cher is a great Emma. She's narcissistic and shallow and yet still likeable. Likeable even though you know you probably shouldn't like her. Maybe because she's not outright cruel to anyone and she really believes she's being kind. And look how nice they are to their fathers.<br /><br />Tai is an adorable Harriet. Unsophisticated in a world where status means so much. She desperately wants to be liked and is so smitten with Emma/Cher that she goes against her own feelings for Mr. Martin/Travis. She's like a lost puppy.<br /><br />Josh makes such a perfect Mr. Knightly. And they kept that whole \"he's sorta family, but not blood so it's not hillbilly\" angle. The relationship still strikes me as sorta weird in the movie but I accept it because I love Paul Rudd. And that scene at that party where the Bosstones are playing and he dances with Tai after no one will dance with her. JUST LIKE IN EMMA where Mr. Elton is a douche to her and won't dance with her even though he totally should have for reasons I don't totally understand because I don't really understand Regency propriety.<br /><br />Elton is the best Mr. Elton. He's such a douche-nozzle in both. He's a super snob and sort of date rapey (in an Austen/PG-13 way). Plus I never understood why Elton would keep a picture of Tai in his locker just because Cher took the picture. BUT Mr. Elton kept the picture because Emma painted/drew it. And that makes way more sense. So I appreciate that detail of the movie, even if it was sort of stupid and not very logical.<br /><br />How clever is the Christian/Frank Churchill thing? Now since I saw the movie first I was wondering how the hell they were going to make a character unavailable to Emma because he's gay and Austen doesn't seem quite progressive enough to include a homosexual character. And if she did I'm pretty sure that's the only thing I'd know about her. How smart was it to take a character that was secretly engaged (which wouldn't have worked in a teen comedy) and make him gay instead? He can flirt with Cher without it meaning anything, at least to him.<br /><br />Now I didn't think the Mel Horowitz/Mr Woodhouse thing really matched up as well as the other characters here, but that's OK because I can't picture it working out any differently. Can you imagine a Mr. Woodhouse that is as much of a pitbull as Mel the litigator (the \"scariest kind of lawyer\")? At the same time, a hypochondriac Mel would never have worked. Or maybe it would have but I loved Cher's father's character so much I don't want him to be anything different. And in both cases the affection Cher has for her father comes through.<br />That is the end of the book/movie stuff.<br />So I prefer the movie to the book. I wanted to like the book more. But I just couldn't stay in the story. I kept getting distracted by literally anything else around me. I should probably give the story another chance but really it was eh.<br /><br />Also another Classics Challenge book down! <br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Classics+Challenge.jpg\" /><br />I also need to read less white people from the US or UK. Baby steps, people, baby steps.<br />This note doesn't really add to the post, but I just like the Bosstones and this was the first time I heard them.

In case you don't like clicking on links, maybe this will jog your memory.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookish-invite.jpg\" />Well that wedding was this weekend (I remembered to send her the RSVP card) and guess what? There were more bookish elements to the wedding! My friend saw me stalking the cake table with my phone out and asked if I was getting pictures for the blog, so she has given her blessing for me to share a few more pictures from her (awesome) wedding.<br /><br />Check out the table decorations! Stacks of books? Check. Scrabble table number dealies? Yup. Confetti made from dictionary pages? You bet. Card catalogue table assignment cards? Oh yeah, those too!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookish-wedding1.jpg\" />Then there's the cake. My friend decided she wanted pie for her wedding because why the hell not? She wants her wild Maine blueberry pie and it's her party. BUT she did have a wedding cake. Or maybe a groom's cake. Anyway, she had a cake in the shape of a bunch of books<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookish-wedding2.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookish-wedding3.jpg\" />If you're curious (and of course you are) the books in that pile are, from the bottom up: El Juego Del Angel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Dr. Who, For Whom the Bell Tolls by Hemingway and that monster book on top? Yeah that is his PhD theses to be. News to him that the dissertation is apparently supposed to be around 3,000 pages. Really, he probably should have stopped dancing and got back to work on that sucker. <br />I missed getting a picture of their \"guest books\" which were actually a couple English-Spanish dictionaries. You pick a word you want to represent your happiness for the couple. Or you pick a word and have it relate to some stupid time in college. To-may-to, to-mah-to.<br /><br />I want to thank my friend for the excellent time at her wedding, congratulate the couple again, and give an extra \"thank you\" for giving me another excuse to put off writing the Emma reviewg that I really need to get to (and the Branded review, and Ready Player One...).

And I suppose book reading doesn't count. Or maybe it does although that would be a boring post. And now I'm trying to figure out how you would read not in real life? Do eBooks counts? I think I'm getting off-topic.<br /><br />Their examples are meeting up with fellow book bloggers in real life or attending book signings. I haven't met any fellow book bloggers in real life (yet but this should be remedied!!) but I HAVE been to a couple book signings. Oh, have I mentioned them? I have? Ad nauseam you say? Well, are you judgy. Fine, I'll keep this brief (and link to my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/book-signings-or-there-will-be-bragging\">original post</a>) because I don't really have any other IRL book experiences/networking to shareg.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Let%27s-Pretend-signature.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Sacre-Bleu-signature.jpg\" />I was lucky enough that in one month, in one week, both Jenny Lawson and Christopher Moore a) had new books out and b) were coming to NYC for book signings. Both events and books were amazing and I was outstandingly awkward when talking to both authors. At least with Lawson she was awkward too so it was cool. With Moore he was still cool about it, even when I mumbled \"heyIreallylikeyourstuffpleasesignthis\". It was still great and I would do it again. I hope to do it again. MOAR BOOK SIGNINGS.<br /><br />What about you? What bookish networking/experience things have you done?<br /><br />I used to do a book club when I lived in Boston, but as I recently learned the club was renamed Wine club which is most accurate. We all read (or at least meant to read) a specific book but a lot of us only saw each other once a month so we spent most of the time catching up.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:55+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:55+00:00","published_at":"2012-06-06T13:27:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e375dde2264190005ca","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Armchair BEA","slug":"armchair-bea","url":"/articles/tags/armchair-bea"}]}]},{"id":"53224e385dde22fdcf0004eb","title":"I didn't forget about Armchair BEA, I'm fashionably late","slug":"i-didnt-forget-about-armchair-bea-im-fashionably-late","url":"/articles/i-didnt-forget-about-armchair-bea-im-fashionably-late","body":"Oh so hey, did you guys know there's this BEA thing going on?

(Well I'm physically in NYC now and other times I live NEAR the place). You'd think I would have signed up because it is all the awesomeness. But I couldn't commit to actually signing up for one or both and instead I ended up doing neither because that's how I roll. BUT I was convinced to take part in Armchair BEA because I still want to play!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/ABEA.jpg\" />So post one, let me introduce myself:<br />Tell us about yourself: Who are you? How long have you been blogging? Why did you start this in the first place?<br />Hi, I'm Alley. Or Red. Either name. I'll answer to both. I've been blogging for 2 years this past May! Perhaps you noticed my post where I talked about forgetting my blogging birthday. Again. Missing events is sort of a theme. I started this because I was whining to Boyfriend one day (or several days) about how I wasn't really doing anything with this English degree I went through all of this trouble to acquire. He said I should start a blog and talk about books because then I could get back into writing and I could talk about something I love. The subtext was I could also quit whining to him about it, but he really should have known better than to think this would stop me from whining.<br /><br />What are you currently reading OR what is your favorite book of 2012 so far?<br />I am currently reading Branded: The Buying and Selling of Teenagers by Alissa Quart and Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. And cos all the cool kids are doing it, I'll answer the other part of this as well. My favorite book so far is hard cos whenever I have to pick a favorite anything I get stressed out and my mind goes blank. So there's a good chance I'll have to change my answer but for now I'm going to go with Attachments by Rainbow Rowell, Let's Pretend This Never Happened by Jenny Lawson and Sacre Bleu by Christopher Moore.<br /><br />Tell us one non-book related thing that everyone reading your blog may not know about<br />I like stupid reality shows. Not Jersey Shore style but more like Hoarders, Parking Wars, and now On The Fly (which used to be Airline but whatever, same show). I guess I like schadenfreude shows, which now that I've realized that sort of makes me an awful person. I also really like dogs. Does that even me out?<br /> <br /> What is your favorite feature on your blog (i.e. author interviews, memes, something specific to your blog)?<br />Umm what now? I guess the only feature thing I do is my monthly reading stats each month. But that's not my favorite thing. So I guess my sporadic rambly posts? I like those.<br /> <br />Where do you see your blog in five years?<br />When did this become a job interview? Also I have no idea. I'd like to say it will only get better and more awesome and will make me lots of money without me having to do anything extra but that seems unlikely.<br /><br />Which is your favorite post that you have written that you want everyone to read? <br />I may come back and fill in this question later, but for now I have NO idea and this will require me to look at past posts, which will take time. So for now, let's just say all of my posts are gems and you should probably commit them all to memory.<br /><br />OK so <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/\">Laura </a>reminded me of this gem of a post about <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/beauty-beast-plot-holes-or-what-happens\">plot holes in Beauty and the Beast</a>. It's not actually book related but it's full of important stuff people need to know. <br /><br />If you could eat dinner with any author or character, who would it be and why?<br />I want to say Christopher Moore because I think that dinner would be hilarious if I could just stop stuttering for a few seconds. But given how the book signing went, that is unlikely. Also as people have pointed out I sort of gush about Christopher Moore a lot and I'm afraid that if I keep doing that I'm going to move into the Annie Wilkes realm of fandom. So instead I will go with fictional Thursday Next because she is also awesome AND she can talk about knowing all kinds of other book people.<br /><br />What literary location would you most like to visit? Why?<br />Like in the real world? Or location in literature? Eh, I'll answer both.<br />Real world, can I go to Shakespeare-land? Shakespeare-land being Stratford-upon-Avon and also visiting the recreation of the Globe theater.<br />Literature, BookWorld! It's a world populated by all of literature and the fictional characters. Plus this way I can cheat and visit all of the literature locations. It's like meeting a genie and wishing for more wishes (or more genies if you need to get around any wish-related rules).<br /><br />What is your favorite part about the book blogging community? Is there  anything that you would like to see change in the coming years?<br />The community part. I love that it is a community and you get to \"meet\" lots of new people who understand a love of books and reading. I know I wouldn't have kept blogging as frequently as I currently do (if at all) if it wasn't for the community around it. In terms of things changing, maybe people could not get so up in arms about every bit of bookish drama (even if I enjoy reading those). <br /> <br />Have your reading tastes changed since you started blogging? How?<br />They've expanded. Books I would have passed by without a second glance are now on my reading list. I learn about new books that are coming out and get to feel superior when non-book people mention them. Even though I don't actually seem to read books during the hype, because I'm a rebel like that. And by \"rebel\" I mean \"too cheap to pick up the new book because the hyped stuff isn't on sale yet\".

Usually my laziness. The first thing I want to make clear is I didn't procrastinate on writing this because I didn't like it. Because I did. I also happen to think I have a pretty good excuse for putting this off a little longer, since technically this morning (Sunday) I was in Boston at a friend's bachelorette partyg and had to go through all of the steps of sleeping (for a couple hours) then trekking my ass back to NY. But I will get this written! If only because I've already finished one other book and I've started too more. I don't want to get too far from reading this before I write down something. But if this post is just a rambly mess of nonsense, you at least know why.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Full+Dark,+No+Stars+cover.jpg\" />So Stephen King, Full Dark, No Stars. I mentioned in my post about bookish shopping that I love me some remainder table books. Boyfriend and I were wandering around our local bookstore and I was about to leave without buying anything (gasp) when I decided I needed one more spin around the remainder tables. That's when I saw this King book and I thought \"This sounds like a title I think I said I was going to read so I put it on my Goodreads list. I don't want to check my phone and see because I'm afraid the people working here will think I'm checking the price on Amazon or something, so I'll just get it.\" In case you're wondering, no, apparently I hadn't put this on my Goodreads TBR list, but that's cool because it was an excellent read anyway.<br /><br />Full Dark, No Stars is a collection of 5 short stories. Or maybe 5 novellas? 3 novellas and 2 short stories? I'm not really sure how to make this distinction but there are 5 stories and the book is 386 pages long. Take from that information what you will. I've been burned by failed short story collections before but I've had success with King short stories before so I was hopeful. I'm never sure the best way to review a collection of stories, so I'll go with some brief thoughts on the 5 different stories.<br /><br />1922<br />A man, Wilfred James, writes his confession about how he murdered his wife. It's a straightforward premise and there's nothing supernatural in the story but it feels like King. The story is a true tragedy. A single action (the murder of Arlene) sets into action a downward spiral for Wilfred and his son Hank. It's a gory story, at least in parts, and I spent so much time wishing things had just turned out differently for the character. Which I suppose is the normal reaction for the tragedy. \"I wish you could go back in time and not do X so then Y won't happen.\" But of course, they can't go back. So I just followed the story wishing and hoping things would turn out OK, but knowing that isn't how things work out. The story is disgusting with an unlikable protagonist (he murdered his wife cos she wanted to sell the farm and move to the city and he didn't want to) but the story works so well.<br /><br />Big Driver<br />When I was first reading this story I was really upset by it. I wasn't sure if I was going to finish it. In the end it was my favorite story, although certainly not the best one. I've gone back and forth deciding if this next bit of info is a spoiler or not. I've decided no, the story stays the same if you know this is coming (and you sort of guess it's coming). However, if you want to skip ahead, feel free. The reason the story upset me and I thought maybe I'll just skip this one is a violent rape scene. There are worse, more violent, more graphic rape scenes in other books, but that didn't make this one easy and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Which I suppose is the purpose so point King. It's not the best story because it's sort of contrived HOWEVER it's a revenge fantasy story so I acknowledged how unrealistic things were and decided I didn't care. It may not have been realistic but it felt better. I was cheering.<br /><br />Fair Extension<br />This is the only story with supernatural elements. A man makes a pact with the devil, but it's not the typical Faustian bargain story. There's no moral. There's no lesson. It's similar to the first story in that it's a tragedy with an unlikeable narrator, but the supernatural element makes the difference. Overall I preferred the first one because it's more fleshed out but expanding on the characters in this story wouldn't have served the purpose. It did what it needed to do, what it wanted to do and I can't imagine it working differently.<br /><br />A Good Marriage<br />How well can you really know someone? Even someone you've been married to for years? It's not a new question but I haven't seen it explored quite this way, from this point of view. I don't want to say too much because it would be easy to give a lot away. As things are revealed I kept hoping for a logical explanation, something other than what was staring me in the face. But even as I hoped for it, I knew that wouldn't be the case. Because if it was, then this wouldn't be a King story. This was excellent and disturbing.<br /><br />Bonus story! Under the Weather<br />This was a creepy short story. It's only 15 pages long so there isn't a lot of time for character development. But like with \"Fair Extension\" that's not the point. However, I wasn't crazy about this story. It's weird and it's creepy but overall I was meh about it.<br /><br />If I could identify any theme among the stories, it would be they all made me uncomfortable. But in a good way. Because if the stories didn't make me feel uncomfortable then I'm pretty sure I would need to check my moral compass.<br /><br />She of the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/bookish-wedding-invitation\">bookish invitation</a><br /> I'm looking at you <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/readers-love-fairy-tales\">My Mother She Killed Me...</a><br /><br />Title quote from page 42<br /><br />King, Stephen.

Then Mad Men depressed me out of writing anything Monday night as I had planned to.g \"Don't worry,\" I told myself. \"I'll definitely write something Tuesday, as soon as I get home from work.\" Ah, such good intentions.<br /><br />For those of you not in the NYC area or those who are around NYC but don't take public transportation, let me explain. Normally my commute involves a 30-45 min subway ride and then a 45 min train ride. Yesterday however, it took 30+ minutes to go between 2 stops. And then after we reached the stop (meaning after the doors had already closed and we started again) the MTA, conductor, whoever makes these decisions, decided \"Eh, we're running on the local line now.\" I just kept looking at my watch and counting off the trains I was missing. When I finally got to the station it turns out those trains were also running on delays of about 30-45 min. I made it home (hooray) but about an hour later than normal (on the days when I miss the earlier train). However, I felt bad complaining once I got home and learned the reason for the insanity was a guy was hit by a train. Not sure if it was an accident or not, but regardless, I was not in a mood to do anything productive last night and instead spent the time watching 16 and Pregnant. Because apparently when I'm mad I like to watch teenagers make bad decisions.<br /><br />So I will have that review soon(ish). And I'm about done with Emma so hopefully that review will be less frustrating to write than it has been to read.<br /><br />We DVR'd the show because I can't seem to watch anything when it actually airs. If you ask me when something is on or what channel I can give you a vague idea of both, but nothing that's, you know, actually helpful.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:57+00:00","published_at":"2012-05-30T13:45:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e395dde223867000283","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"excuses","slug":"excuses","url":"/articles/tags/excuses"}]}]},{"id":"53224e395dde2264190005cb","title":"Book shopping or I'm fickle","slug":"book-shopping-or-im-fickle","url":"/articles/book-shopping-or-im-fickle","body":"This post was going to be a review about Full Dark, No Stars by Stephen King. But there's a Chopped marathon on right now so I can't concentrate enough to write a review. Instead I want to talk about shopping.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shopping.jpg\" />Probably because I'm currently reading Jane Austen's Emma which as you (should) know is the inspiration for Clueless. Which means the whole time I'm reading this I'm going \"OH so this is like after the \"Rolling with my Homies\" party scene. And Sir George Knightly is Josh, aka Paul Rudd. Got it.\" I also maaaay have bought a DVD combo pack of Clueless and Mean Girls, because my copy of Clueless was on VHS. How '90s.<br /><br />Now since this is a book blog, the shopping will focus on book shopping. Where do you get your books?<br /><br />I know a lot of my fellow bloggers have crazy TBR piles. There are several TBR challenges. I don't do this. I have a TBR list. It's my Goodreads list. But I usually buy a book, read it, repeat. It's probably why I re-read so much. At least one of the reasons. I'm not great at planning my reading. It's why challenges intimidate me so. I have to commit to reading stuff? What happens when the time comes and I don't feel like reading that? WHAT THEN? So normally when I buy a book, I read it right away. Which means I can go into a bookstore and find a bunch of books that are on my Goodreads TBR list, but unless I'm in the mood to read it right then, it will stay in the bookstore.<br /><br />Unless of course, the book is on one of those remainder tables. If a book is on sale I feel less inclined to have to read it right then. Because what if later when I do really want to read the book, it's not on sale anymore?? I'm cheap, so I still don't go too crazy, but I can't leave a bookstore if I see something on one of these tables that I sorta maybe want to read. Remainder tables for the win!<br /><br />Now I said I'm cheap, which is part of the reason I don't buy ALL the books when I'm at a bookstore. You'd think this would mean I used the library a lot cos hey, free is the best. I do not. I should. I know I should. And I'm pretty sure there's a library around the corner from me. And definitely one not too far from our local indie bookstore. But  I don't want to borrow the book. I want the book to be mine. I want to be able to reread it whenever I choose or be able to pick it up and look for a passage. I want to display it on a shelf and go \"Oh yeah, I read that\" even if I'm only saying it to myself. I'm vain that way.<br /><br />I do buy books from Amazon, at least for my Kindle. I don't typically order physical books online but not because of \"grr Amazon.\" I am very impatient. If I want to read a book, I want to read it right then. I don't want to wait for it to come in the mail. This is also why Netflixg never worked for me. We'd pick out movies to rent but the few days later, when they actually showed up, I didn't care about watching them anymore. Why yes, I am annoyingly fickle. This is also why I love downloading books because I can be anywhere and get a book. I've done this on my commute when I finished the book I brought with me, but I still had train time. Of course I can't display these on my shelf, so my vanity and my impatience have to battle it out<br /><br />What do you do? Do you have crazy TBR piles? Do you pick your reads in the moment? <br /><br />For those that might go off topic and ask why I don't just do Netflix Streaming, we did. And you know what's on Netflix streaming? Not much. Every time I went to look for a movie, it said \"Oh nope, not available. But don't you want to watch Ninja Bimbos Part III?\" After watching all of the Archer and Party Down episodes available, we cancelled our account.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:32:57+00:00","published_at":"2012-05-25T13:12:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e395dde2264190005cc","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e395dde2223b6000102","title":"Non-book blogs/sites you should check out","slug":"non-book-blogs-slash-sites-you-should-check-out","url":"/articles/non-book-blogs-slash-sites-you-should-check-out","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-3.jpg\" />This is probably obvious, but most of the blogs I read are book blogs. I never really followed too many blogs before starting my own, so it makes sense that as I joined this world I mostly follow and read other book bloggers. But there are a few other blogs I've discovered that are amazing and should be shared. And this week's <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2012/05/jens-top-ten-blogssites-that-arent.html\">Tuesday Top Ten (hosted by The Broke and the Bookish)</a> gives me that opportunity. If you aren't already familiar with these, you should fix that.<br /><br /><span>Food</span><br /><a href=\"http://acozykitchen.com/\">A Cozy Kitchen</a> - It's so hard to read food blogs because they have photo after photo of delicious looking food and all I want to do is eat right then and not bother with that whole pesky \"cooking\" thing. Though I actually do enjoy cooking. I just enjoy the eating more. There's so much I want to try that I haven't gotten to. Yet.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.howsweeteats.com/\">How Sweet It Is</a> - I heart food. Jessica hearts food. And good food too, like cheese and bacon. The important stuff. She beats Cozy Kitchen only because I've made a few of her dishes and they've been fantastic. She managed to bust through my laziness and make me go \"I NEED arugula pesto &amp; white cheddar mac &amp; cheese\"<br /><br /><span>Humor</span><br /><a href=\"http://thebloggess.com/\">The Bloggess</a> - You read this right? Cos you listened to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/no-one-ever-expects-vaginal-arthritis\">my post about her book</a> when I told you she made me cry I was laughing so hard and I commanded everyone to read her blog. Because if you still haven't check her out, I don't even know. Jenny Lawson is hilarious and wonderful and posts about all kinds of things, from her battle with depression to some mushrooms in her yard that sort of look like boobs. You get it all.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://volcanicensemble.blogspot.com/\">The Sassy Curmudgeon</a> - I think I found her post when I saw someone wrote a \"review\" of a sports bra that holds a bottle of wine in the cups so you can drink at moments where a glass of wine is inappropriate. But sucking from a straw coming out of your cleavage is fine. That someone was Una LaMarche and she has some amazingly awkward stories from her teenage years as well as chronicling her undying love for high quality TV shows, like America's Next Top Model.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bad-lions.blogspot.com/\">Bad Lions</a> - These are images from various paintings and sculptures. Of lions. That look like pretty much anything other than lions. Straight forward and hilarious.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/\">Hyperbole and a Half</a> - Allie hasn't written for awhile but till then I am sated myself with her old posts. She writes about various topics and usually includes a comic. If you only read one of her posts (which is stupid cos you should read ALL THE THINGS) read <a href=\"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/11/dogs-dont-understand-basic-concepts.html\">Dogs Don't Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving</a> which cracks me up every time.<br /><br /><span>Other cos I don't really know how to categorize this one</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/\">Freakonomics Blog</a> - If you liked the Freakonomics books, you should check out the blog. It's like a continuation of the books and they tackle new topics and relationships and incentives the books missed.<br /><br /><span>A Tumblr</span><br /><a href=\"http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/\">#whatshouldwecallm</a>e - animated gifs that crack me up. I can waste days on here.<br /><br /><span>Non-blogs but still amazing</span><br /><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/\">Cracked</a> - Not a blog but I site I'm on all the damn time. It's a humor website, admittedly geared towards guys, although only sometimes to an annoying amount.

I tried reading this a few years ago, when I was trying out different ereader programs on my iPod Touch. (This was my iBooks test. A Christmas Carol was my Kindle app selection). I quit reading it not because I wasn't enjoying it, but because I couldn't get myself to read on such a tiny screen. Which is stupid, by the way, because whenever I was actually reading on it it was fine. Other than the fact that I had to turn the page ever sentence or so. But I had trouble getting past the idea of the tiny screen so I never finished. Now I had a new chance and this book counts towards my <a href=\"http://www.sarahreadstoomuch.com/p/classics-challenge.html\">Classics reading challenge</a> so, I'm in!<br /><br />I've read some Sherlock Holmes before. Just the short stories, never a full novel(la?) and I enjoy them. Also I can't help but picture Holmes and especially Watson as the mice from The Great Mouse Detective.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/greatmousedetective.jpg\" />Although Disney left out all of the opium. And made Basil/Holmes less of an insufferable asshole.<br /><br />Anyway, a doctor shows up with a case that only Sherlock Holmes can solve and tells him about this evil hound that has been terrorizing the Baskerville residence. Sir Charles Baskerville was found to have died OF FRIGHT with a big paw print near his body. There's a legend that this evil dog has been haunting the family every since one of the Baskerville descendants kidnapped and planned to rape this neighbor girl. Now the new Baskerville heir Sir Henry is due in England from Canada and the doctor is afraid the guy is going to get killed by the hell hound. Holmes agrees to take the case, but then says he needs to hang around London so Watson should go hang out in Devon for awhile till he can get away from all his other important work. Watson is to get to know the neighbors, keep a close eye on Sir Henry and let Holmes know all that he finds. Will Holmes and Watson be able to solve the case? What is actually terrorizing the Baskerville family? And what is going on with that bog? <br /><br />And as I've been doing lately because I'm too lazy to make a coherent post, here are some random thoughts<br /><br />Holmes is an asshole. Not a charismatic one either, just a condescending one. Right on page 3 Holmes asks Watson to deduce all he can about their visitor based on a walking stick left behind earlier. Watson makes some pretty good deductions and even says he's proud of all he's learned from Holmes. Holmes's response: \"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.\" The worst part might be Watson's reaction. It's along the lines of \"My God Holmes, you're quite the genius and us morons are lucky to have you around.\" And the stories are all what Watson recorded, so you'd think there'd be a little more \"Shut up, you ass\" even if it was just mumbled under his breath.<br /><br />gThe rest of this will be sort of spoiler-y. I mean, this is a mystery and all<br />Holmes is hardly in it. I know I just got finished talking about how he's an asshole, but I'd still prefer having him hang around being a patronizing shithead. Sure it turns out he was there the whole time hiding in the bog, but we didn't get to hang out with him. We were with Watson as he watched the weird neighbors and tried to keep Sir Henry from spending too much alone time with the naturalist's \"sister\".<br /><br />After reading the first chapter when we hear about the dog haunting, I thought the whole plot would be more Scooby-Doo-esque. Cos really? Demon dog is scaring people away from a property. Jinkies! What I was not expecting was there to be an actual dog. Just a dog, bigger than normal but not hell hound size, with some phosphorus in his mouth to make it look like glowing (something that wasn't brought up until they mentioned the phosphorus). That's...that's it? The mystery was \"There appears to be a giant dog terrorizing this family. No you fools, it's actually a slightly larger than average dog terrorizing the family.\" Well, thanks for the twist, Doyle. Yes, yes, that naturalist neighbor was setting the dog on the family so HE could get the house but there was something so unsatisfying to find out that was it. Maybe I'm too jaded.<br /><br />I actually think I was so disappointed with the resolution because the stuff leading up to it was far more interesting. There was a very dangerous convict that had escaped! People were told to be on the look-out. And the butler seemed to have something going on. Creeping around while his wife spent her nights just bawling about something. And that crazy old guy that just kept suing everyone all the time. There was set up to have this be something more but it just fell flat. <br /><br />There's a whole plot point about how dogs don't eat dead meat, which is why they didn't find any bites on Sir Charles. Cos he had already had a heart attack by the time the dog showed up. But really? I get that it's the idea behind playing dead with bears but does this work with dogs? Especially dogs that have apparently been starved before being set loose. <br /><br />For that matter, does this even work with bears? Cos most of my wilderness survival tips come from Looney Toons.<br />spoilers contained<br /><br />Summary: OK and entertaining but the short stories are better. Also I should probably see the new Sherlock Holmes, if for no other reason than Holmes is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, which might be the best name ever. He's really a wizard right?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Classics+Challenge.jpg\" /><br /><br />Title quote from page 32<br /><br />Doyle, Sir Arthur Conan.

I'll remember to bring this up to Boyfriend next time I forget some important date.<br /><br />Anyway it (was recently) my blogging anniversary. I've been doing this for 2 years now and it's been wonderful.  Boyfriend talked me into starting a blog because I was bugging him about not really using my English degree and blah blah blah. So he gets a lot of credit for this. Which he reminds me about whenever I start going on (and on) about blogging.<br /><br />What Red Read started just as an opportunity to write about books since it was the only topic I could think of where I wouldn't run out of stuff to say. So I wrote and wrote. At first it was just to myself and for myself. Then slowly I began to find other book bloggers. And other book bloggers found me. I read books I would have never previously considered that were recommended by bloggers I would now consider friends. I've joined two reading challenges. I've participated in a readathon and a readalong. This blog has become a lot more to me than just a chance for me to record the thoughts about the books I'm reading.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this blog has been the people I've met. Or \"met\" I suppose since I haven't actually met any of these people in person. I'm sure if it hadn't been for the people below (and more that I've inevitably left off because, look, I missed my own blog birthday.

Normally I don't like hardback books. They're so cumbersome. Even this one I didn't bring with me on my commute because I like my back in the not hunched over position. But still I'm happy I have the hardback of this and not just because I got it signed. (<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/book-signings-or-there-will-be-bragging\">Although SIGNED!!</a>) This is a really pretty book. The rough cut pages, the dark blue text, and most importantly, the artwork.<br /><br />Sacre Bleu is a book about art, if you couldn't figure that out from the subtitle. But it of course has a little of the supernatural woven in because it's Christopher Moore. The story opens with the death of Van Gogh. One day he goes out to paint in a field, shoots himself in the chest and the drags himself a mile to the door of a doctor while raving about a Colorman. But why would he shoot himself and then walk a mile to a doctor? And who is this Colorman Van Gogh said has been following him around France?<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Toulouse+Carmen.jpg\" />Toulouse's The Laundressg Unfortunately, we don't get to spend a lot of time with Van Gogh, what with the whole bullet through the chest thing in the first few pages.That's OK though. Well I mean, not OK for Van Gogh but we get two hilarious narrators: Lucien Lessard, a young baker and painter, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. I love Henri and he is just the type of character Moore excels at writing: a kind person with a healthy taste for debauchery. Sure, he spends a good portion of the book in night clubs (Moulin Rouge, Chat Noir), whore houses and bars, but he's a true friend to Lucien and to the other Impressionists. There's a wonderful scene near the end of the novel that captures the spirit of Toulouse-Lautrec. Lucien woke up on the floor, having just come out of a trance and sees Henri lying there with him: \"'Why are you lying on the floor?' Lucien asks. 'Solidarity,' Toulouse-Lautrec says. 'And we ran out of cognac. This is my preferred out of cognac posture.'\"<br /><br />Now, I mentioned the whole \"trance\" thing. And that mysterious Colorman character. This strange little man keeps showing up the artists and offering them paint, especially ultramarine, the Sacre Bleu. This is the color used to paint the Virgin Mary and is extremely rare. The Colorman never accepts money from the artists, who indeed are never really sure they want to buy color from him, although they always seem to end up with some. The artists seem to lose time while painting with it. There are paintings they remember working on but don't seem to be anywhere. And of course there's the matter of Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo about a Colorman following him to Arles.<br /><br />The Colorman isn't the only mystery character here. Lucien's love, Juliette, broke his heart years before by just disappearing. Suddenly she's returned, with no explanation for where she's been and why she's back. No one trusts Juliette, except Lucien, who can't stay away.<br /><br />This is, no doubt, a Christopher Moore book. It is his style, his voice, his humor. And yet, it's different than his other works. It's funny but it doesn't have the same laugh-out-loud moments like A Dirty Job and Lamb. But this isn't a bad thing. This may be a more serious comedy, but it's a comedy nonetheless.

In books, I mean. Is this a backlash against the capable, competent manly men of years past, with some examples that I can't think of at the moment. Walter in The Woman in White was sort of that. At least that's what Collins was going for. Whatever the reason, I like the beta-male characters. Those alpha males are too confident for me. Give me the insecure, self-deprecating guy. I mean, there's a reason I love Jesse Eisenberg.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Jesse+Eisenberg.jpg\" /> Nerd suave With this in mind I'd like to talk about Domestic Violets by Matthew Norman. Tom Violet is a wanna be author currently working a job he hates, writing company press releases. He's having some bedroom problems with his wife, who currently wants to have another kid. And on top of all of this his dad just won the Pulitzer for Fiction. Le sigh.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Domestic+Violets+cover.jpg\" />I really enjoyed this. Sure, it's somewhat predictable. Marital trouble? Check. Unsatisfied at work? Check. Dysfunctional relationship with a parent? Check. But it's the characters themselves that made the story. Tom is hilarious, which is good because the book is from his point of view so if I didn't like him the book would have been a slog. And his father is a force, running through marriages and liquor. I thought there would be more tension between father and son, but while their relationship isn't very conventional there is a lot of love there. Maybe not exactly \"talk about our feelings\" love, but more of \"break into my ex-wife's/my house to pick up a change of clothes\" type love.<br /><br />There are moments of drama that were surprisingly touching. When so much of the is so sarcastically funny the serious moments can seem insincere, or at least melodramatic but they worked here. I wasn't tearing up but the scenes felt honest. And this was a quick read, one that drew me in. I didn't want to have to put the book down and head into the officeg.<br /><br />I was going to say my primary complaint is that the female characters aren't as fleshed out as Tom ans his father Curtis. However I realized none of the other characters are that fleshed out so I suppose the complaint his only the two main characters are fully realized. And this is really a small complaint because I didn't really think of it until I started typing this up. Besides my favorite character his Curtis's agent's son Brandon, who isn't much more than the sassy gay New Yorker but I loved whenever he was on the page.<br /><br />I can see this being a book I re-read. It's a funny, quick read, a good book to read in between some of the more draining books. If you like the beta-male trope, along the lines of a Jonathan Tropper or Nick Hornby, this is worth a look.<br /><br />There's a part in the book where Tom describes how his job has these interns whose job is just to constantly monitor Google alerts to see if their company is mentioned. He talks about how ridiculous and boring this job must be. A good portion of my job involves helping people do EXACTLY that. And I have to say, I'm happy I'm not the one who has to actually do the monitoring.<br /><br />Title quote from page 65<br /><br />Norman, Matthew. Domestic Violets.

Last month I took part in <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Alice's</a> The Woman in White readalong. I didn't want to read ahead of the week's designated chapters. At least not until I had written that week's post. However that left me time when I was done with my WiW reading and needed something else. I very briefly attempted to start Jane Austen's Emma but the styles were too similar. Yes, I know, different period and everything but to my untrained eye I was mixing up characters and took a cue from Greg (aka <a href=\"http://bookriot.com/2012/04/10/when-literary-opposites-attract/\">The New Dork Review via BookRiot</a>), that if I am going to read multiple books at once they need to be very different. At the time <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/\">Laura from Devouring Texts</a>g was reading Bryson's Notes from a Small Island and I thought reading some Bryson was an excellent idea. I'd just go USA style with his The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America. And here we have it.<br /><br />Not long after Bryson's father passed away he decided to travel around the US in search of a quintessential American small-town. The kind that you see in 1950s movies, where everything is clean and neat and everyone is happy. Plus this gave him a chance to reconnect with his home country, after living in England for so long. He starts off in his home down of Des Moines, Iowa and first heads east, stops home for a bit to re-energize and then continues west. And he covers most of the continental US, hitting 38 out of the lower 48 and driving 13,978 miles.<br /><br />If you've read any Bryson before, you have a good idea what you're in for. He gives you a little bit of history about a place, tells you about his adventure (or lack thereof), shares stories about the people he encountered, whether they were lovely or morons and is constantly confounded by the prices he encounters. Bryson manages to make any topic interesting, and his travelogues are especially entertaining. After an evening of carousing with his brother he decides to leave his car in Pennsylvania and take a long distance bus up to NYC.  As he describes: \"By and large a ride on a long-distance bus in America combines most of the shortcomings of prison life with those of an ocean crossing on a troopship.\" The fact that he was nursing a massive hangover may have made the ride that much more of a hell for him (made all the worse by his seatmates) but at least I enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's not all schadenfreude however. There are moments when he finds something truly awe inspiring, like his visit to the Grand Canyon or even just admiring the beauty of Iowa's rolling farms. There insights into the oddities of American life, sometimes about something trivial and sometimes more serious. He noted while driving towards Elvis's home that there were lots of large nice homes that were next to tiny shacks. \"It struck me as notably ironic that Southerners could despise blacks so bitterly and yet live comfortably alongside them, while in the North people by and large did not mind blacks, even respected them as humans and wished them every success, just so long as they didn't have to mingle with them too freely.\" I'm not sure how true (more? less? the same?) this is now compared to 1989 when the book was published, but it is an interesting question nonetheless.<br /><br />This may not be my favorite Bryson book but it is fun to watch him experience the variations in sights America has to offer. He may never find a single town to live up to his small-town America expectations (because really, such a town can't exist in the real world and I promise I'm not spoiling anything by saying this, as he comes to this realization fairly early on) but he does find bits and pieces of perfection.<br /><br />I didn't realize how many book bloggers were responsible for my decision to read this book. Apparently I don't make any choices on my own anymore.<br />Seriously spell check??

Not me. I'm all for it. Even if most of the time I think the book is better. I get to be the director when I'm reading the book so it's my vision. Of course I think it's better. I'm very vain. But that doesn't mean I hate every movie based on a book. All of this rambling is to introduce this week's <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2012/05/julias-top-ten-books-to-be-made-into.html\">Tuesday Top Ten topic hosted by the Broke and the Bookish</a>: top ten books I'd like to see made into movies. Some of these may have already been made into a movie, but I'd like someone to give it another go. Some of them haven't been made yet and hurry up already Hollywood and give these a try! You're clearly out of ideas anyway. Let's get to it, shall we?<br /><br />1. Fool by Christopher Moore - He actually talked about this possibly being made into a stage play (!!!) but I would also love to see this on screen. King Lear but from the Fool's point of view, with lots of dirty jokes and some very touching moments.<br /><br />2. The Big Over Easy by Jasper Fforde - I considered the Thursday Next series, but I'm not sure if it would work on screen. The Nursery Crime series, however, has a shot. And Hollywood seems to be all about re-purposing characters. Abraham Lincoln is about to be a vampire hunter, Edgar Allen Poe is going to help detectives solve murders based on his crimes, so why can't Jack Spratt be a detective working to solve the Humpty Dumpty murder?<br /><br />3. The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins - I realize this has been made into a movie but awhile ago and I haven't seen it. Haven't just finished reading this and LOVING a number of the characters (Marian, Fosco, Mr. Fairlie) it would be so much fun to actually see them. If there could be references to Marian being a velociraptor all the better.<br /><br />4. Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell <span>by Susanna Clarke</span>- This might work better as a mini-series but regardless, this would be so much fun on screen. Magic brought to life in Victorian England? Yes please!<br /><br />5. Zeitoun by Dave Eggers - It's funny and heartbreaking, and don't movies always advertise that you'll laugh and you'll cry? This is just the type of story the academy loves to award. AND it's based on a true story. Really I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />6. 11/22/63 by Stephen King - I actually heard they were making this into a movie, which isn't really surprising. King movies can be pretty hit or miss but the fact that this one isn't a horror story means there's more chance things will go right.<br /><br />7. This Is Where I Leave You by Jonathan Tropper - Middle-aged white guy problems but oh so funny. The Foxman family hasn't been in the same room as one another in years but with the father's death everyone comes together. Of course Judd's wife won't be joining the family, seeing how Judd just caught her in bed with his boss. Judd's in crisis which sucks for him but is hilarious for us.<br /><br />8. Tokyo Vice by Jake Adelstein - Jake is the only American working at the Japanese newspaper working the crime beat and he learns of Tokyo's seedy underbelly. He wrote the book because he learned too much about some Yakuza crime bosses and figured if the book was out there, there's no reason to silence him. Hollywood loves crime stories, especially ones with conspiracies. And again, true story!<br /><br />9. My Name is Will: A Novel of Sex, Drugs and Shakespeare by Jess Winfield - It's Shakespeare so, you know, classy. But it's also sex and drugs so, you know, Hollywood. Everybody wins! There's a contemporary story of a professional student studying Shakespeare and then scenes of Shakespeare's early inspirations. Like a prequel to Shakespeare in Love. Kind of.<br /><br />10. Time and Again by Jack Finney - Another time travel story but different from King's telling. There's no famous political figure but we do get to visit New York in the 1800s. And there's a mystery! Plus a lot of the setting is spent in my \"if I could live anywhere I'd want to live here\" building, NYCs Dakota.<br /><br />What books do you think would make great movies?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:00+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:00+00:00","published_at":"2012-05-01T13:03:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e3c5dde22fdcf0004f0","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e3d5dde2223b6000106","title":"My hands tingled to strike him, as if I had been a man!","slug":"my-hands-tingled-to-strike-him-as-if-i-had-been-a-man","url":"/articles/my-hands-tingled-to-strike-him-as-if-i-had-been-a-man","body":"We have come to the end of The Woman in White. Before we mourn the end of this amazing readalong, let's go over how Wilkie ended this journey.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WiW+readalong.jpg\" />Where we last left off, Percy had immolated himself, because he is not so brightg. This is what happens when Sir Percival quits listening to Fosco. In a way this was great for our trio because now Percy wasn't going to be a problem. The downside is it's going to be difficult to prove Laura being a live and her death being a ruse without one of the ruse perpetrators. This just means Walter needs to get Fosco to admit to the truth. And given how dismissive he was of Marian's warnings about the Count, this should be fine.<br /><br />Walter gets back to London and it turns out Fosco knew where they were living because Walter sucks at not being followed. Marian is a ninja and should have been the one doing the sneaking around. Fosco pays Marian a little visit. He goes on about how much he admires Marian and pretty much he hasn't done anything to them because of that. Marian is telling Walter about how much this upset her but Walter is all \"yeah yeah blah blah blah but what'd he say about meeee?\" Methinks someone's jealous.<br /><br />We also learn for certain that Anne, our woman in white, and Laura are actually half sisters, which you kind of assumed given how much the 2 women look alike. It wasn't the most exciting revelation but it was better than finding out Percy was everyone's dad and then also Laura's husband. So thank you Wilkie for staying away from incest.<br /><br />Laura and Walter get married and it is uneventful.<br /><br />Then we get to the important part of the story! Walter must now face the final boss, Fosco, and restore Laura's honor! Also convince everyone Laura's really alive and it was Anne that died. Walter has a plan to take down Fosco.<br /><br />See Fosco is Italian. And Walter's buddy and our favorite minor character Professor Pesca is Italian. And all Italians know each other (obviously) so Pesca will know all sorts of secrets about Fosco. Walter and Pesca follow Fosco to the opera. Pesca doesn't recognize Fosco but when Fosco looks in their direction he freaks out and leaves the opera early. Walter is convinced Fosco is terrified of Pesca, even though Pesca has no clue who the guy is. There is a man hanging out near them with a big scar on his face. Then he runs out after Fosco while Pesca and Walter got stuck in the crowd. Then he seems to show up a few more times and Walter thinks \"well isn't that coincidental!\"<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/facepalm.jpg\" /><br />But before the man with the scar can keep showing up everywhere, we learn about Pesca's past. He's part of a secret Brotherhood back in Italy and has been stationed in England for years. They don't really explain what the Brotherhood does BUT if you cross them, they will cut you. Into pieces. Turns out Fosco is also part of this Brotherhood and he has crossed the organization. Walter decides to use this information to force a confession out of Fosco before he flees.<br /><br />He writes a letter to Pesca as sort of an insurance plan should anything happen to him and he confronts the Count. Fosco is evil but also sort of a badass so he asks Walter if he wants to know what he's thinking, reaches for a gun and says: \"I am thinking...whether I shall add to the disorder in this room by scattering your brains around the fireplace.\" Because he's actually an '80s action movie villain, full of quips. But Walter's letter to Pesca saves his ass and Fosco writes his confession.<br /><br />You don't learn too much new during Fosco's confession except that Mrs. Ruebelle apparently didn't make Marian worse. Actually Fosco did everything he could to make Marian better because he admires her so much. We do learn that Anne dying so quickly was not part of the plan, since she died before Laura even left Blackwater. Which sort of throws off the whole Laura is Anne ploy so is just what Walter needs to hear.   Fosco manages to escape England, but he can't escape the man with the scar.<br /><br />Fosco's confession is just what is needed to prove to everyone who Laura really is. Walter and Laura move to Limmeridge and eventually inherit Limmeridge for their son. Oh and Marian moves with them so the 3 of them can keep hanging out forever. Like Laura wanted when she asked Marian to never marry. The end.<br /><br />I want to say a big thank you to Alice for hosting this readalong. This is the first one I've been able to do and it was super fun. This was a story I was a little meh on but it was so much fun to read and write about it with a group of people.

I also had trouble reading this book in public.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Let%27s+Pretend+cover.jpg\" />I already told you that I went to the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/book-signings-or-there-will-be-bragging\">book signing</a> for Jenny Lawson's first bookg Let's Pretend This Never Happened (A Mostly True Memoir). Obviously if I went to the book signing I'm looking forward to this book. I was prepared to love it and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />You may already be familiar with Jenny Lawson through her blog, <a href=\"http://thebloggess.com/\">The Bloggess</a>. If you don't already know her blog, you have to check it out. Consider it homework. But do that after you finish this post or I'll probably never see you again. You'll get sucked into her stories about the time she accidentally mailed herself a cobra, her various disagreements with her husband Victor, or all the time she spends hiding in bathrooms during parties. If you do read her blog, you know what you're getting into when you read her book. During the book signing Lawson mentioned that most people assume the book came about because of her blog. In actuality, she started the book first (10 years ago) and began writing her blog in an effort to make herself write and to find her voice. And she found it. And it's glorious.<br /><br />Lawson's memoir focuses on the embarrassing, difficult moments in her amazing yet unconventional life. Because as she says, how you react to the most moments you want to pretend never happened is what makes you who you are. This isn't a straight memoir. There are a lot of non sequiturs. It's not that it's stream of consciousness, so much as it jumps around to lots of different, but related, topics. It's like talking to someone with ADD. Also be prepared for cursing. For whatever reason Lawson gets grouped in with mommy bloggers so there's this expectation that she's child friendly or at least doesn't write chapters like \"And Then I Got Stabbed In The Face By A Serial Killer\" or \"It Wasn't Even My Crack\". Lawson gives you her own warning right in the intro:<br /><blockquote>I apologize in advance...for offending you, because you're going to get halfway through this book and giggle at non sequiturs about Hitler and abortions and poverty, and you'll feel superior to all the uptight, easily offended people who need to learn how to take a fucking joke, but then somewhere in here you'll read one random thing that you're sensitive about, and everyone else will think it's hysterical, but you'll think, \"Oh, that is way over the line.\" I apologize for that one thing. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking.</blockquote>I had trouble reading this book in public because I was laughing so much I was crying. That is not an exaggeration. Tears were falling. The good part was I did manage to get a 3 seater on the LIRR to myself. I think the person who (briefly) sat with me thought I was losing it. Because she doesn't understand the magic of having Lawson's father throw a live bobcat at her future husband. I saw someone at the Christopher Moore signing the night after the Lawson one reading her book and laughing as well. So fair warning, you will literally laugh out loud and get strange looks from people.<br /><br />I was trying to think of quote to share. Or even name my favorite chapter. But the problem in both cases is I just end up listing everything. It is all my favorite. Even writing this post I almost started reading the book again. It's a quick read and many of the chapters can be read as stand alone stories. And sometimes I need to hear about her crazy stories from when she worked in HR. Or what it was like when her father brought home a tub full of baby raccoons. Or about how Victor refuses to donate his organs on the off chance that if he comes back as a zombie he'd be less effective if he was missing his eyes or something.<br /><br />I know this is gushing and not very objective. But who cares because I loved this book. Any time I'm feeling down and need to smile, I will be reading a chapter or two. I guess if I had a complaint it would be some of the later chapters are things she also had posted to her blog, at least in part. So some of it I had read already. And I suppose I won't say it was a completely life-changing book but come on, that's a lot to expect from a book that has a taxidermied Hamlet mouse on the cover.<br /><br />I say first book because I hope there are more to come. Please.<br /> Alright she does write a separate mommy blog for Chron.com. Neither this nor her personal blog are mommy blog-esque, even if she keeps showing up on those lists <br /><br />Title quote from page 230<br /><br />Lawson, Jenny.

He is so put upon. Why can't everyone just leave him alone to treat his servants like furniture and damn them for grinning? Fanny, Laura's servant at Blackwater, comes with a message from Marian and Mr. Fairlie is so concerned her shoes will creak because there is a limit to his endurance. (Don't worry, her shoes do not creak. PHEW!)<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WiW+readalong.jpg\" /><br />What we learn from Mr. Fairlie is that he's as ridiculous and self-absorbed as ever and I'm so glad we got to listen to his ridiculousness. He is so annoyed that his brother \"inconsiderately marries,\" dies, and has the nerve to leave his daughter to Mr. Fairlie. ALSO the Count showed up and managed to annoy him less than, well, everyone else on the planet. He also tells him he should let Laura hang out at Limmeridge but Marian is sick so don't wait up for her!<br /><br />Oh yeah, Marian is seriously ill. All her ninja-ing in the rain before has caused problems. Oh noo. Now she's at the mercy of Fosco and Sir Percival AND Fosco found her diary so he knows what she knows and shit. They bring in a doctor (Mr Dawson) and the Countess gets a nurse (Mrs. Rubelle) but Marian is not getting better. Probably because she used up all her awesome powers in the last section. She's a mere mortal now. A mere mortal with typhus. Fosco and Mr Dawson do not get a long, which means you know Mr Dawson is clearly a good guy.<br /><br />So while Marian is in bed trying not to die, there is no one to watch over the rest of the house to see what Fosco and Percy are up to and THEY ARE UP TO THINGS. Sir Percival fires just everyone at the house and says he's leaving. Then they do a bit of a bait and switch on poor Laura. They tell her Marian suddenly got better! but no one bothered to tell Laura but she actually decided to head out and is hanging out in London with Fosco and the Countess before continuing onto Limmeridge, and Laura should totally just go there too. She tries to make arrangements to stay with other people in London but that doesn't work and she ends up with Fosco and the Countess. But oh hey, guess what?? Marian is actually still at Blackwater in one of the rooms that Laura didn't check because Laura is not thorough.<br /><br />Then Laura gets sick and weak in London and she tragically dies of some sort of heart failure. You know, like that heart problem Anne told Laura she had. The same Anne that looks just like Laura. I'm sure that's all just coincidental. Except obviously not. So when Walter is visiting \"Laura's\" grave a figure comes towards him and GASP, it's Laura.<br /><br />When Marian got better she went back to being her velociraptor self and figured out the little switcheroo Fosco and co. did with Anne and Laura. She found Laura who had been in an asylum telling everyone she wasn't actually Anne Catherick, and obviously no one believed her. She breaks her out of the asylum because OF COURSE she does. When they meet up with Walter at the graveyard they all go into hiding in London. Marian keeps house, Walter makes money and Laura sits around. I know she was in the crazy house and the crazy houses then were not a fun place so she's been through some difficult times but Marian and especially Walter need to give her some credit because right now their arrangement reminds me of Lisa Simpsons meeting her rival's family. Especially when they tell Laura she can help earn her keep by selling her sketches except Walter's really buying them.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Lisa+Ball.png\" /> I have a ball. Perhaps you'd like to bounce it? Marian and Walter are still trying to figure out how to punish Fosco and Sir Percival for what they've done but to do this they must learn Sir Percival's Secret. Walter talks to Gilmore's colleague who's taken over his work and Anne's mother to try to find the secret, but Sir Percival has people following him so it's not easy. He eventually does discover The Secret and it's.....sort of anti-climactic. Maybe not back then when it was monocle-popping shocking but learning that Sir Percival's parents weren't married is kind of eh. I know, it means he loses the Sir and people won't like him and all but still. I was expecting dead bodies in that lake. Anyway, Walter tries to get proof of this and almost does except Sir Percival sort of beats him to it! And sets the proof on fire! And also sets the vestry and himself on fire so things didn't really go as planned for Percy. So what now? Do we go after Fosco? Was that really Sir Percival in there and now a charred skeleton?<br /><br />Look at everything that happened! I forgot so much of it until I started writing this thing, and then I ended up spending the whole post re-capping what happened. But seriously, there was so much. And there's still so much to happen. Plus I'm keeping my fingers crossed for bodies by the boathouse.<br /><br />Title quote from page 231, location 5172<br /><br />Collins, Wilkie. The Woman in White. Amazon Books, 2006.

Happy dance!<br /><br />A friend of mine noticed Jenny Lawson, aka <a href=\"http://thebloggess.com/\">The Bloggess</a>, was doing a book signing for her first book Let's Pretend This Never Happened (A Mostly True Memoir) in NYC and we're in NYC so we should do something about this. And so we had plans for April 17th.<br /><br />A few days later I realized Christopher Moore is also on tour, promoting his new book Sacre Bleu: Comedy D'Art, so I decided to look up his tour schedule. And what do you know, but he's in NYC on April 18th. Excitement!<br /><br />Naturally I went to both of them, much to my wallet's chagrin. Also the part of me that likes sleep's chagrin, because each night I didn't get home till late. Not that the book signings went that long, but I had to get back to LI after each and that was a struggle.<br /><br />Both were amazing and different. Lawson's event was slightly smaller (certainly had a smaller space) but packed. Moore's space was larger and there were definitely more people there, but it wasn't quite so cramped. B&amp;N at 86th underestimated the crowd Lawson would draw while B&amp;N Union Sq knew the crowd Moore would bring and had the room. Lawson talked a little bit about writing the book and read a (hilarious) chapter. Moore talked a little bit about writing/researching the book and about random shit like the idea of a Rastafarian Princess Disney movie. During Q&amp;A, the people at Lawson's event asked simple, to-the-point questions. People at Moore's event rambled on to show how clever they were and how much of a fan they were and OMG get to your stupid question already. While getting the book signed Lawson seemed as nervous as I was while Moore clearly has experience with meeting lots of fans. Both different and both so much fun.<br /><br />Now that I've gone from having never attended a book signing to going to 2 in 2 days, I've decided I'm both a newbie AND a veteran of this. Because that's how this works in my head. And obviously because I have the fresh experience on both sides, I'm going to start giving tips that I learned that are probably crap if you've been to more than 2 book signings, so please feel free to correct me in the comments.<br /><br />1. Don't ask long rambling questions to try to prove to the author how smart you are or how much of a devoted fan you are because you're annoying everyone. No really, everyone. B&amp;N even (nicely) told people not to do that before the program started. After someone asked Moore a question he would repeat it back so everyone could hear. The fact that he could condense these long questions into a couple quick sentences means those people should have done that to begin with.<br /><br />2. Get there early! Or at least get as close as you can if you're planning on getting your book signed. For Lawson's event my friend picked out awesome seats and we were the 3rd and 4th people to get our books signed. At Moore's event I was about mid-way through the audience and waited an hour. I believe the signature was worth the time but Boyfriend, who was waiting for me with food, was less thrilled.<br /><br />3. Going up and actually getting your book signed is awkward. Maybe if you're a SUPER VETERAN it gets easier. Or maybe if you're naturally suave and/or charismatic. While I sounded exceedingly witty in my head, I'm fairly certain what came out when I got my Moore book signed was along the lines of \"You write good I like sign please!\" I sort of accepted the awkwardness ahead of time so at least I wasn't disappointed with how things went walking away from the table.<br /><br />OK so I only came up with 3 tips. But those are gems, I tell you.<br /><br />Exciting news for Moore fans! He's currently working on a new book (yay!) and it's going to be another Shakespeare one, like Fool (YAY!!!) I actually mumbled something about how stupid excited I was to hear he was working on another Shakespeare book and then he talked about the opening to Henry V and how hard iambic pentameter was to write and I'm sure I smiled like an idiot, but it was still awesome.<br /><br />And exciting news for Lawson fans AND people who've made it this far. I'm giving away a copy of Let's Pretend This Never Happened! See when I heard her book was coming out, I got all excited and pre-ordered a copy. And then she announced her book tour w/ NYC being the first stop. Which is nifty but that was also the day my book was shipping so I didn't have it for the book signing and it's not like she has other books out I wanted her to sign. So obviously I bought another copy, which means I have a copy coming to me and I don't actually need 2 of them. My impatience is your gain! So just leave a comment with why you want this book and your email address and I'll randomly select one of you to win it. And while I would super love to open this to international readers, I looked up the rates to do that and they are just awful. Like 3 times the value of the book awful.<br /><br />If you want to see pics of the space and try to find me in the crowd Lawson posted some pics to <a href=\"http://thebloggess.com/2012/04/this-isnt-a-real-post-2/\">her blog </a><br />I can't find me in the crowd. I was sitting front row left and I think I'm blocked by some people. So I just asked you do something I knew you couldn't do, because I'm an ass.<br />Why yes, I do have a footnote off of a footnote. And then another footnote to explain that. There's magic happening here.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:02+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:02+00:00","published_at":"2012-04-20T13:28:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e3e5dde22fdcf0004f2","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Sacre Bleu","slug":"sacre-bleu","url":"/articles/tags/sacre-bleu"},{"value":"christopher moore","slug":"christopher-moore","url":"/articles/tags/christopher-moore"},{"value":"Let's Pretend This Never Happened","slug":"lets-pretend-this-never-happened","url":"/articles/tags/lets-pretend-this-never-happened"},{"value":"Jenny Lawson","slug":"jenny-lawson","url":"/articles/tags/jenny-lawson"},{"value":"book signing","slug":"book-signing","url":"/articles/tags/book-signing"}]}]},{"id":"53224e3e5dde2264190005d7","title":"New to book blogging? My humble advice","slug":"new-to-book-blogging-my-humble-advice","url":"/articles/new-to-book-blogging-my-humble-advice","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/toptentuesday.jpg\" />I haven't participating in the <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2012/04/jamies-top-ten-tips-for-new-book.html\">Broke and the Bookish's Top Ten Tuesdays</a> in awhile, but this week's prompt intrigued me. So Top Ten Tips for New Book Bloggers.<br /><br />1. Write what you like. This seems obvious and I would assume if you're writing about books and reading you like books and reading. But beyond that, make sure you're enjoying what you're writing. Don't write something just to get traffic. Those posts are obvious, so you're not fooling anyone. And if you don't even like what you're writing, why should anyone like reading it?<br /><br />2. Comment on other people's blogs. The book blogging community is the best part of book blogging and you'll never get the full experience if you just post but don't engage.<br /><br />3. But don't leave pointless comments. A comment like \"Nice post\" is boring and doesn't start a conversation. Don't feel like you have to comment if you don't have anything to say.<br /><br />4. You will find other like-minded book bloggers. If you like paranormal YA romance it might be easier to find those like-minded book bloggers. But no matter what genres you like or what writing style you're into, there are blogs out there you will like. You may have to look for them but when you find them, it's great.<br /><br />5. Post regularly. That doesn't mean you have to post every day or even every week. But don't let your blog sit idle for months. Or I guess do that if those are only the times that move you to write. It just may be difficult to find a regular audience if they don't know when you'll show up.<br /><br />6. Try out some of the memes/hops. There are lots of different ones out there and it is a great way to learn about other blogs. Just make sure you actually hop around and visit the other blogs.<br /><br />7. But don't feel like you have to do any of the memes/hops. If something isn't for you, don't do it. If you don't like the prompt, if your tastes change, don't feel bad about skipping it for a week or dropping out entirely. It goes back to enjoying what you're writing.<br /><br />8. Back up your reviews. If you love a book, tell me why you loved it. If you hate a book, tell me exactly what it was about the book that made you want to chuck it into the ocean. That doesn't mean you can't write a review that is based on emotion. Those can be great, as long as I can relate. If all you say is \"I loved it!!\" I got nothing.<br /><br />9. Don't be cruel. Maybe you hated a book. Maybe you vehemently disagree with another blogger's post.  Maybe someone left a comment on your blog and totally missed the point you were going for. That's fine and you should feel free to disagree. The conversations would be no fun if it was just everyone patting each other on the back. But don't get nasty.<br /><br />10. Write what you like. Did I mention this already? Well, it's that important. If you're doing this because you love it, why make it a chore for yourself?<br /><br />What tips have I missed?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:02+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:02+00:00","published_at":"2012-04-17T13:03:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e3e5dde2264190005d8","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e3f5dde2223b6000108","title":"Why he should have been so discomposed by a trifle I cannot say - but he was seriously discomposed","slug":"why-he-should-have-been-so-discomposed-by-a-trifle-i-cannot-say-but-he-was-seriously-discomposed","url":"/articles/why-he-should-have-been-so-discomposed-by-a-trifle-i-cannot-say-but-he-was-seriously-discomposed","body":"Before I get to anything about the next part of the book, look what I found!<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Miriam+the+velociraptor.jpg\" /> By <a href=\"http://phillycartoonistsociety.blogspot.com/2011/06/victorian-velociraptor-with-violets.html\">Adam Mazur</a> Every time I read anything about Miriam/Marian this is what I pictured. And it was wonderful. Clever girl, indeed.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WiW+readalong.jpg\" />Now, to The Woman in White. Gilmore's narrative comes first but isn't that interesting. The only things you learn are a) Laura is posed to get just a boatload of money b) Sir Percival Glyde has written an agreement that gives him all the money on Laura's death instead of Laura's family, which is typical and c) Mr. Fairlie is even more awful/amazingly narcissistic than I previously believed and let's Percy get away with his plan because eh, whatever; he'll prob die first anyway. Gilmore's narrative is short which is good because that means we get to Miriam the Velociraptor's section quicker! <br />So much happens! Finally there's some action. Well pseudo action. And there's a new Italian guy who, granted, is no Professor Pesca, but he is still entertaining in a very ominous sort of way. Marian, Laura (now Lady Glyde, which sounds like a classy porn name), Sir Percival Glyde, and Count &amp; Countess Fosco are all hanging out at Sir Percival's home and Percy is living up to Anne's warning letter of him. He's being a real asshole to Laura and Marian, although Fosco seems able to keep him under control. <br />Fosco is an interesting character. On the surface he seems to be looking out for Marian and Laura. He comes to their rescue a couple times when Percy goes all nuts, he trains animals like mice and birds, he loves sweets. These don't usually make for an intimidating presence. But Marian doesn't trust him. And his wife, who used to be loud and obnoxious is very quiet and subservient now. How'd he do that?  He seems to be spying on Marian as she tries to discover what's going on with Sir Percival and the Woman in White, but at the same time he seems to have a plausible explanation for everything he does. Very creepy.<br />I am finally starting to get on Laura's side with this section and it was all based on the scene where Sir Percival tries to get her to sign something without letting her read what it is she's signing. And Laura stands up to him! Who saw that coming?? Marian has to convince her a couple times she's right to not sign something without knowing what it is but still, Laura stood up for herself. She's still boring but at least she's not weak anymore. She even throws the pen down when insulted. That is more action than I thought possible from her. Go Laura. <br />But really, it's the end of this section that made me go I MUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! Sir Percival definitely has a secret. He was trying to get to Laura's money (hence the document he wouldn't let her read) AND there's also a secret that he thinks Laura and Walter know about. The Woman in White knows his secret. I want to know! I was on the edge of my seat, literally gasping (and getting weird looks) while Miriam the Velociraptor sneaked onto the roof to eavesdrop on Sir Percival and Count Fosco's conversation. The tension! Will she get caught? Who knew she really was such a badass? Do you see why I can't help but picture her as a velociraptor. Although it just made me think \"If she was a velociraptor, she would have bit his head off by now. It would have been shorter story sure BUT still awesome.\" And that post script at the end of her diary??? I wasn't sure if I was supposed to read that since I think it's past where we read (although Alice fixed that yesterday) but I couldn't help it and all I can say is dun Dun DUUUN!!!<br />I know I'm gushing but she's the best and here are some quotes to back that up\"I banged the door after me, and I hope I shattered Mr. Fairlie's nervous system for the rest of the day.\"\"Being, however, nothing but a woman, condemned to patience, propriety, and petticoats for life, I must respect the house-keeper's opinions, and try to compose myself in some feeble and feminine way.\"\"I remember the time, Countess, when you advocated the Rights of Women and freedom of female opinion was one of them.\"<br />One last quote that made me laugh when I read it:\"Even baldness, when it is only baldness over the forehead (as in his case), is rather becoming than not in a man, for it heightens the head and adds to the intelligence of the face\"Oh Collins, first you talk about how Marian's little forehead makes her so ugly and then you go into detail about how a big forehead makes a guy look smart.

There's going to be a lot of gushing. Be prepared.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Attachments+cover.jpg\" />Lincoln is the security tech guy in charge of making sure no one is using the company email for personal conversations or cursing or anything remotely fun. Emails from two employees, Jennifer and Beth, keep getting tagged. But their conversations are incredible and Lincoln can't even bring himself to send them a warning. Yet he keeps reading their emails and develops feelings for Beth. It's a romantic comedy, which is not my normal cup of tea. I think the last one I read was Pride and Prejudice. Lamb was kind of bromance-y. Anyway, what I'm saying is normally romantic comedies aren't for me. But this snuck by normal cynical defenses and I didn't even realize I was reading a romantic comedy until I was already in love with all the characters.<br /><br />Lincoln's the main character and you spend a lot of time as his failed relationship and his job that he hates. And of course reading Beth and Jennifer's emails. Don't get me wrong, I liked Lincoln and I liked seeing him break his normal routine. And I sort of loved his mom and her cooking. But every time a chapter started with an email from Jennifer and Beth I got all excited. You only see these guys through their emails that get flagged so the fact that they establish themselves as so amazing so quickly is a skill. My favorite moments are all contained in their conversations. It's hard to find lines to share because the joy in these two is really their back and forth but here are a couple examples:<br /><br />Jennifer to Beth: Maybe I do like Tom Cruise. But I hate feeling pressured to find him attractive. I don't.<br />Beth to Jennifer: Nobody does. It's a lie perpetuated by the American media. Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts.<br />Jennifer to Beth: Men don't like Julia Roberts?<br />Beth to Jennifer: Nope. Her teeth scare themg<br /><br />Beth to Jennifer: I don't know if I ever believe in that anymore. The right guy. The perfect guy. The one. I've lost faith in \"the\".<br />Jennifer to Beth: How do you feel about \"a\" and \"an\"?<br />Beth to Jennifer: Indifferent.<br />Jennifer to Beth: So you're considering a life without articles?<br /><br />Beth to Jennifer: Why are you lying awake, thinking that you're a terrible person?<br />Jennifer to Beth: To keep my mind occupied when I can't sleep. Some people count sheep. I self-loathe.<br /><br />Don't you love them already?!?!?!<br /><br />You should read this book! Right now. Right now! Although it was hard to find. Or rather, I went to my local indie bookstore and I couldn't find it (but I didn't ask so it may have been there) so I ended up getting an e-copy. So it's not that it was hard to find, it just didn't fall into my outstretched hands.<br /><br />Also you should read Alice from <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2012/02/attachments-prepare-yourself-for.html\">Reading Rambo's</a> and Rayna from <a href=\"http://www.libereading.com/2012/03/attachments-by-rainbow-rowell.html\">Libereading's</a> because they're amazing and their reviews are great and the reason I picked this up.<br /><br />Rayna shared this quote too but it's just. that. good I had to share it here too.

Readalong post ahoy!<br /><br />So even though it's been made very clear, I'm still sort of in denial that there's no ghost in this story. So when Walter sees the woman in white walking along the road I kept expecting her to suddenly disappear while wearing his jacket and then he goes to find her and is told she's dead and then he sees his jacket on her grave AAHHHHHH!g So what I'm saying is \"escaped from insane asylum\" while fun, is not quite the same. But given that disappointment is my own fault even though I knew better, I can't hold this against Wilkie.<br /><br />Besides, what the story lacks in ghosts, it makes up for with amazing characters. Professor Pesca, the Italian almost-but-not-quite dwarf. How fantastic is he? A little ball of energy who is SO EXCITED that he got Walter a teaching job, even if I don't think \"got you a 4 month teaching job\" is quite equal to \"saved you from drowning\", but if Walter's cool with it, that works.<br /><br />And there's Mr. Fairlie, master of the house where Walter is teaching art. He's a hypochondriac. Or really suffers from maladies that make it so things that annoying him will kill him. Also he has super human smell, given he was offended by the \"odour of plebeian fingers\" on some art he'd asked Walter to take a look at. That was pretty awesome. So really, he's an ass who is rude to his servants and wants to stay away from everyone. We don't see him much (so far) but he's pretty great in that one scene.<br /><br />But the best character is Miriam. Even if she keeps talking about how lame ladies are. At first when she's all like \"Ladies, we suck don't we? Man I wish I could say the things that guys do.\" I was taken aback. But then she'd go ahead and say what she wanted. So I'm thinking (because I love her character) she's voicing the position most people at this time have about ladies and she's being sarcastic about it. Every once in awhile I remember it's Wilkie who wrote this and think maybe he really feels this way, but then why would he make Miriam so amazing?  Anyway, here are some of her gems I highlighted<br />\"How can you expect four women to dine together alone every day, and not quarrel?\"<br />\"no woman does think much of her own sex\"<br />\"Women can't draw - their minds are too flighty, and their eyes are too inattentive.\"<br />\"Don't shrink under it like a woman. Tear it out; trample it under foot like a man!\"<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, there's the actual plot involving Walter falling for the most boring person in the Limmeridge House (Laura) but she's getting married to a Baronet (Sir Percival Glyde) that the asylum lady hates. Oh also asylum lady has a name (Anne) and she grew up for awhile with Laura and sent a message talking about how much of a jerk Glyde is. Walter is sad Laura's getting married to someone that's not him, so he leaves the house. End of Walter's narrative!<br /><br />So what's going on with Anne?<br />Why'd Glyde (probably) send her to the hut house?<br />Will Professor Pesca show up again and be hilarious?<br />Will we see more of Miriam being awesome?<br />Will Laura and Walter get together, even though they're both pretty boring so I'd rather spend time with the other characters?<br /><br />Onto The Story Continued by Vincent Gilmore!<br /><br />I like urban legends...<br /><br />Yes, yes I know it's Marian. But I like Miriam better so I'm sticking with that at least when I think about her name. Also I've been calling her that for whatever reason for this long so now the name has stuck in my mind.<br /><br />Title quote from location 148, page 11<br /><br />Collins, Wilkie.

I wasn't planning on writing them down but then I left this long comment on <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2012/03/devouring-films-hunger-games.html\">Laura's post about the movie</a> so I thought maybe I should write my own. But instead of a coherent post I'll just bullet point out things I loved.<br /><br />gSpoilers so you should probably have already seen the movie. Or at least read the book<br />Jennifer Lawrence made me like Katniss. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2012/yes-gamemakers-have-to-have-victor\">As you may remember</a>, I wasn't exactly enamored with Katniss from the book. Maybe because the book is from her point of view and it's a bad idea to spend that much time in the mind of a sixteen year old. But I thought book Katniss was whiny and oblivious and I wanted to smack her several times. JL Katniss was never whiny. She was brave and strong but still terrified, which is the exact reaction you should have in such a situation.<br /><br />I loved District 11's reaction after Rue's death. Yes, I missed District 11 sending Katniss the bread after she covers Rue's body with flowers. However, I liked the riot a lot more. This wouldn't have worked in the book because the book was from Katniss's point of view and she couldn't see anyone's reactions. But seeing the people of District 11 riot after Rue's death shows you just how dangerous to the Capital Katniss's actions were.<br /><br />On the topic of Rue's death, all the stuff about the race and how because Rue is black in the movie (and book people) that her death was less painful. Those people can go fuck themselves because seriously, that was so much more heart-wrenching in the movie. Maybe because you don't have to see this innocent little girl when you're reading. And Collins doesn't really describe her in detail until she and Katniss join up. But in the movie it's brought home exactly how young she is. And how sweet and childish she looks in her dress during the interviews. In the book I thought Rue's death was manipulative, just a chance for Katniss to feel a death and for the reader to feel the loss of a character that doesn't mean too much. But in the movie, just seeing this little girl, brings to the forefront the brutality of the games.<br /><br />Cato's lines right before he dies. I like the Careers. They're made to be these enemies and in the arena they are a force but they lose their lives while they train for these games. Not only if they lose the game but they lose their entire childhood training to be killers. The movie gives a moment of insight into the Career Cato. He's bloodied and he's holding Peeta in a choke hold while Katniss aims her bow at him. He tells her if she shoots him, he'll just take Peeta down with him into the pack of wolf things below them. He says he'll have no problem killing Peeta. He can do it again, it's what he was trained to do. It's all he knows. And you can hear the shame in his voice when he's saying this. How he knows what he is, how he hates what he does but it's what he does. In those moments you get the feeling that he hates the games as much as everyone else in the Districts.<br /><br />In the book we see the story from Katniss's point of view and hear her thoughts. We don't have that with the movie so they have the TV announcers fill in the holes. Not only does this mean more Stanley Tucci (yay!) but it also means you get to see how the Game is portrayed as entertainment. It really brings to light how callous the Games are. I've seen sports announcers display more pain at a missed free throw than these announcers display when announcing the death of a tribute. While reading the book you can forget that this is all entertainment but the movie doesn't let you forget.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:04+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:04+00:00","published_at":"2012-04-05T13:12:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e405dde2264190005da","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"The Hunger Games","slug":"the-hunger-games","url":"/articles/tags/the-hunger-games"}]}]},{"id":"53224e405dde2264190005db","title":"Thoughts on Wilkie Collins or how I'm already behind on this readalong","slug":"thoughts-on-wilkie-collins-or-how-im-already-behind-on-this-readalong","url":"/articles/thoughts-on-wilkie-collins-or-how-im-already-behind-on-this-readalong","body":"This is my first time doing a readalong and I'm already behind.

And then another person had a post about the guy (and his giant forehead). And another. And another. And then I realized shit, I already missed the first post. And I was so proud I remembered to buy the book.<br /><br />I wish I could say that even though this post is a day late, don't worry it's super awesome because I have great thoughts about the guy.

But as Miss Winter says, I should probably start at the beginning<br /><br />I can't remember exactly why I picked this book up. I knew it was a fairly popular book, although I can't actually remember seeing any reviews of it. I do seem to remember it was a book for book lovers and it has ghosts and secrets and \"gothic strangeness\" (so says the back of the book). It's a book I'm drawn to but not immediately taken with. However this copy was on a remainder table and a sale always gets me. So I picked this up. Then Alice of <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Reading Rambo</a> suggested I read Turn of the Screw first so I put the book down intent on really doing this. And then months passed and I hadn't read either book. Last week I decided screw it, I'm just going to read The Thirteenth Tale without having done my homework first. (Umm Alice, my dog ate it...)<br /><br />When I started the book I was very...unhappy with it. I hate the narrator. She annoyed me so much and pretty much anytime she was talking (and being the narrator it was fairly frequent) I would find my mind wandering. I'd put down the book and stare into space. You'd think it'd be easy to pay attention to a book when I'm sitting on a train and have nothing else to do but at times I was like \"I could keep reading, but I think I should stare at this brick wall for awhile instead of seeing what else Margaret has to say\". Luckily a lot of the book is made up of other people telling Margaret stories, so there are large chunks where she's not around at all. I loved these parts. <br /><br />Quick summary: One day Margaret gets a letter from Miss Vida Winter, a famous and much loved author, asking Margaret to act as biographer. Miss Winter has always been a bit of a mystery but in her last days she's ready to tell the truth. So Margaret learns Miss Winter's history, which involves unruly twins, possible ghosts and a fire that destroyed the Angelfield estate.<br /><br />Miss Winter's stories are fantastic. I was sucked into that world completely. Even when it got weird and incesty. Because it gets weird and incesty at times people. You learn about this house that is full of secrets and ghosts and a lot of very neglectful parents. You also get to hear stories from a man that grew up just outside the grand estate, an orphan who never knew his family and had been trying to untangle that mystery for years. Whenever we got these stories, things were great. Whenever Margaret showed up and spent way too long talking about sharpening pencils, I started to wander. Because seriously? Pencil sharpening? Why was there more than 1/2 a sentence about that?<br /><br />While I overall enjoyed the story, there were problems with it. Little things (other than Margaret sucking) that made me stop and go \"Wait, what?\"<br /><br />-The book talks about twins. A lot. At one point there's a description of twins and about how twins are created when a cell that's supposed to be one splits into two. Which yes, that's how identical twins are created. Not fraternal though. So you're partially right. Of course she then goes on to talk about how twins are completed and everyone else is a sad shadow of a person, incomplete, because they don't have a twin and that's why people form relationships and get married and such. Because twins never do that.<br /><br />-The incesty stuff, although I suppose that's supposed to make you go \"wait, what?\" And it's never explicit. Merely implied. <br /><br />-Some of the things Setterfield describes that are supposed to be very deep end up unintentionally hilarious. They may seem good on paper, but as soon as you try to picture someone doing this, it's all lost. For example, in Miss Winter's story the twins had been separated and are then reunited. They are so happy to be back together that they hold each other, staring into each others eyes for 24 hours. And they blink in unison. Take a second and just picture 2 people holding each other, staring into each others eyes and blinking in unison for hours on end. Takes away some of the power of that reunion doesn't it?<br /><br />-Margaret is sort of obsessed with books. To the point of ridiculousness and this is coming from someone that writes a book blog and LOVES books. But at one point she talks about how she's such an inveterate reader that she can't help but traipse through this overgrowth to read a memo posted on a dilapidated house. Really? She loves reading THAT much that she MUST read this memo? Not because she's curious about the memo. It's her need to read that makes her do this. Of course this contradicts her earlier saying she doesn't read the contemporary novels that are at her father's bookstore. <br /><br />It was an entertaining book. It's not the most bestest book ever. It's not the best written, there are inconsistencies and obv I hated the narrator (have I not been clear on that yet?) but I still enjoyed it. And I didn't see the twist coming so touche.<br /><br />Title quote from page 58<br /><br />Setterfield, Diane. The Thirteenth Tale.

First Lord of the Flies, then this. Who knew books that dealt with children killing children would be a theme for my reading this month.<br /><br />Firstly, yes, I liked it. Yes, I will be reading the other books in the trilogy even though I heard they're not as good. Yes, yes, you were right internet. I was drawn in, I didn't want to put it down, I was annoyed at my commute for not being longer, which is stupid because no I don't want that. See that's what this book did. <br />So here's the thing, I know there have been a thousand and one reviews of this book. And I'm sure the majority of those are better than what I would write. Instead I want to focus on where I felt cheated. Now I want to it be clear that these problems come after the fact that I still really liked the book. Also in order for me to talk about my issues, I need to bring up plot points so this will contain spoilers. If you haven't read it yet, go read it (it will take you a couple days, it's a quick read) then come back here and say \"Why, yes! I completely agree! What was going on with that?\" or \"What are you talking about? You have no idea what you're saying\". Whatever floats your boat.<br />SpoilersMy first problem is the love story that they sorta shoehorned in there. I know, people have said it makes more sense in the other books, but it doesn't make a lot of sense in this one. It feels like it was shoved in there last minute and it's hard to have a love triangle when one of the triangle points is only in the book for about 7 pages. The fashion stuff with Cinna also seemed sort of shoved in there. It bothered me less than the beginning of this love triangle, but there still seemed to be more time than made sense dedicated to describing clothes.<br />Those are small things compared to my major complaint. I felt cheated. We have a story that centers on this messed up government holding a fight to the death among a bunch of children. These are kids that didn't ask for this (I'll get to the Career Tributes in a minute) and are thrown into a literal kill-or-be-killed situation where one's survival is directly related to another's death. And all of this is for the entertainment of the people watching. This has the opportunity for serious moral dilemmas. Not only does it have the opportunity, it sort of requires it. But Katniss hardly killed anyone.<br />Now I don't mean this as a \"I thirst for blood!\" kind of way. I mean Katniss is thrown into a arena where her goal is to be the last one surviving and even in this situation she is hardly forced to kill. And the kills she does complete are simple. She never has to deal a difficult death. She (somewhat) indirectly causes the death of a couple unnamed tributes when she drops the tracker jacker nest on them. She shoots another unnamed tribute who had just killed her ally and friend and was about to kill her. She mercy kills Cato after he'd been mauled by the weird muttationsg. But she is never in the position where she has to kill someone she cares about, like Rue or Peeta. Hell, she never even has to kill someone she admires, like Thresh or Foxface. Never. What the hell? Again, it's not that I wanted her to have to kill someone she cared for, but that is sort of the whole point of the Games and by having Katniss never have to face this it means we, the reader, never actually face up to what these Games mean. Collins may say it over and over, and have Katniss think about how awful it would be to have to kill Rue or Peeta but she never shows it. You never get the emotional impact from it. What if she had to kill Rue? How would she have dealt with that in the aftermath? Yes, it would have made the book very depressing. But you know what? If you don't want to write a depressing book, don't write a book that centers on a fight to the death among children. It was a cop out and robbed the story of what it could have been.<br />I also want to talk about the Career Tributes. I didn't have a problem with them and I get why they're portrayed the way they are, since you're seeing things from Katniss's point of view. But when I was thinking of this and about how the kids that are thrown into the Games against their will, there is obviously the argument that the Career Tributes do want to be there. They are blood-thirsty, deranged killers, and they are disgusting. Besides that, these are people from the wealthier districts, that never felt the hunger and pain that someone like Katniss has felt. You're supposed to dislike these kids. They band together to attack the weaker tributes, they hurt Peeta, they kill Rue, etc. But thinking of them as the enemies, almost as bad as the Capitol, is wrong. Every District has to send 2 kids to the games. The names are picked out of a hat but someone can volunteer to take a tribute's place. These Career Tributes train their whole lives for the Games. They volunteer to take the place of other people that are picked. Which means they are saving the lives of other people in their District. The families in these districts know who will be going to the Games. Their kids aren't in danger. The Careers will go. Fine, they're more ruthless than the others. And they're volunteering for something that no one should want to do. But it's not like the Districts can just not send someone, so these kids are sacrificing not only their lives (since the odds are good they won't make it) but also their childhoods, which they are going to spend training to kill other people. I hope the Career Tributes get a little credit in the other books because they have their own heartbreaking stories.<br />So what do you think? Did you like the love story? Am I wrong about the cheat? Would it have ruined the story if Katniss had to kill someone she cared about? Would that have made it unfit for a YA audience? What about the Career Tributes? Spoilers in there<br />I cannot say muttations without laughing, which kind of messes up how scary these things are supposed to be.<br />Title quote from page 344<br />Collins, Suzanne.

Whether you love the guy or hate him, you can't deny that the guy can tell a story. I decided to re-read The Green Mile for <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/11/smooth-criminals-reading-challenge-for.html\">Ben's Smooth Criminals Reading Challenge</a> for the Prison Book category. I'm so glad I did. I know I should be branching out, reading new things, blah blah blah but no regrets with this one. I originally read this sometime after the movie came out but most of the details I remembered were from the movie.<br /><br />This isn't a horror story. For those of you that stay away from King because you're afraid, this isn't a horror story. It's not a happy, rainbows and kittens. I mean, the story takes place on death row during the Depression. But there aren't demonic hotels or zombie cats or anything like that. It's the story of Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard at Cold Mountain penitentiary and John Coffey, a giant black man convicted for a brutal crime and sentenced to die. But there's something about Coffey. He doesn't seem like a killer. His first night on the E Block he asks if they leave a light on at night because he's afraid of the dark.<br /><br />King sucks you into this world he's created. I didn't read this as it first came out, so I didn't read it in its serialized version. I wish I did. It would have been amazing to have the story drawn out like that, waiting to see what was going to happen in the next installment. My copy has all of the books smooshed into one, but you still have the separations for each of the books, so you can see where it would have ended. I could imagine how it would have been to have the story end and have to wait for the next part. It's not like waiting for the next book in a series, because here the story isn't done yet. You don't have the story wrap-up that you get with something like the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />The story is heart breaking but it never feels manipulative. You feel these characters trapped in the situation and you get angry because it's so unfair. But it's supposed to be unfair. The Jesus references are a little heavy handed. OK, they're a lot heavy handed, but I don't remember them being so obvious. Maybe because the first time I was so enthralled with the story. This time I could take in the scenery a little bit more. But still, it wasn't enough to hurt the story. Which was wonderful and this will definitely be a book I read again.<br /><br />So even if you don't like horror or aren't a King fan, give this book a try. It's worth it.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Smooth+Criminals+challenge.jpg\" />Two challenge books in a row completed! What's that?

As if I wasn't already afraid of kids. And not those children of the corn, demon kids. This is worse because these are normal kids. Little British schoolboys. Choir boys.<br /><br />I hadn't read William Golding's novel before. There was a chance my freshman year of high school, but I was put in the group reading 1984g. I'm not sure which was worse. That doesn't mean that this and 1984 are bad books. They're not.  But in terms of \"WTF humanity\", it would be good battle. I had a very vague idea about what Lord of the Flies is about, mostly from the Simpson's episode \"Das Bus\". What I'm saying is I was unprepared and there was very little model UN and a lot more kids showing us the worst of what people naturally are. Upbeat and whatnot.<br /><br />It's difficult to review a classic because what am I supposed to say? Hey, have you heard of this book? Oh you have? Right, of course. Well then, what'd you have for lunch? If you haven't read this before, go ahead and do that. Cos this is mostly going to be a random collection of my thoughts and will be all sorts of spoilery. Not that I actually think it matters if you already know the details of this one, but in case you care.<br /><br />Spoilers. Like I said a second ago but in case you weren't paying attention<br />So the basics: these kids are stranded on a deserted island. And they are kids. The oldest are about 12, the youngest 6. The kids try to make due, they elect a chief and plan to keep a fire burning so hopefully a passing ship will see the smoke and rescue them. Look how responsible they are and there is hope! And then this quickly gives way to insanity.<br /><br />A boy is burned to death (probably) and everyone is just like \"nah I'm sure he's fine. Let's not worry about the fact that we never see him again.\" The antagonist (one of those choir boys, which makes him adorable but under normal circumstances, not frightening) gets scarily obsessed with killing a pig. Like \"oh our only meas of rescue went out while I was supposed to be watching it and a ship passed by and we'll all probably die on this island. But you guys, I totally killed something! Here, we should act it out on this boy.\"<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/simpsons+das+bus.jpg\" />Things grow tense between the rational boys and the hunter/choir boys which culminates in a frenzied dance where they literally tear apart, with hands and teeth, the only good kid in the whole group. Murder. With bare hands. By a bunch of children. WTF? After that, the death of Piggy, murder by boulder, was nothing. Or at least was a lot less because what the hell, children should not be murdering each other with their bare hands. Or boulders. Children should not be murdering. We can probably leave out the qualifiers of \"with their bare hands\" or \"with boulders\".<br /><br />Now there's only one non-savage boy left (our protagonist Ralph) and the rest of the boys on the island are hunting him! In an effort to find him they burn the whole forest down, because children don't understand subtlety. Luckily they're saved from starvation (cos they just burned down the forest where the fruits, nuts and pigs they eat come from) when a ship notices the conflagration and rescues the boys. He laughs when he sees the boys because he assumes they've been playing fun, not-at-all-murderous games and then gets freaked out when the kids start crying. But they're saved and go back home to probably a lot of therapy. <br /><br />I knew going into this Piggy dies. I didn't know how. I didn't expect death by boulder so kudos for the surprise there, but I knew he didn't make it. So when I started the book I was thinking how Golding was going to make me super love Piggy, just to take him away. But that didn't happen. I didn't want Piggy to die, but I certainly didn't love the kid. He's just...so...annoying. And whiny. It seems mean to get angry at a child for being whiny when they're stranded on a deserted island, but I'm a cruel person apparently. I wanted the boys to be nice to Piggy, but every once in awhile I wanted someone to smack him upside the head.<br /><br />The death that really got me was Simon's, he of the torn apart murder. Why do people go on about poor Piggy? What about Simon? He was so good and so innocent. He was helpful and kind to the little kids when all the big kids were being just assholes. He has his little quiet time in nature. OK, so he goes a little crazy for awhile and pictures the sow head on a stick (the Lord of the Flies) talking to him and telling him that the true horrors are inside him and all mankind. But that doesn't make him go on a murderous rampage, as I'm sure it would have driven the other boys. Instead he realizes the beast they've all been afraid of is actually a dead parachutist (which is creepy in and of itself) and he goes to tell the others they don't have to be afraid. And they kill him. They all kill him, even rational little Piggy and Ralph, even if Piggy won't admit that's what happened.<br />Spoilers contained<br /><br />So there you go. This was an excellent book that crams a lot of deep thoughts and difficult questions into a simple story. I didn't go into all of the symbolism up above but it is there and people smarter than I have written about it. I'm very glad I read this so thank you Strand in NYC for having it on sale and thank you <a href=\"http://www.sarahreadstoomuch.com/2012/01/challenge-link-up-post-20th-century.html\">Classics Challenge</a> for pushing me to read a classic I previously missed. <br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Classics+Challenge.jpg\" />So don't worry, I still got scarred, just by a different book.<br /><br />Title quote from page 225<br /><br />Golding, William.

It's nothing against them and if you like them, awesome. But love stories and rom-coms are not my thing. But I decided to give The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger a try. It's out of my comfort zone, it's by a female author (and I've really been slacking on those), and it has come highly rated from Brenna at <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musings</a> and she has good taste. Plus a few people said it was much better than the movie, which I have not seen but assume it's very mushy/melodramatic. Anyway, the book was on a remainder table at my local indie bookstore so I decided to give it a try. I am happy to say it is much better than I anticipated, even if my expectations were fairly low.<br /><br />This is a love story. It's not the mushy, roll-your-eyes-at-every-sentence love story, but at least know that's what you're getting. It is a love story with time travel. And now that I typed that I'm thinking something like Kate &amp; Leopoldg with someone traveling forward from the past (or the other way) and then they have a love in this fish-out-of-water situation. The time travel is what causes and gets in the way of the love story. Henry DeTamble, the time traveler of the title, can't control his time travel. It's a genetic disorder that causes him to travel through time, usually visiting himself at various points in his life. Oh also, he can't bring anything with him on this travels, so he shows up naked and starving. He learns to steal (for clothes &amp; money) to fight (because a naked man showing up randomly is not typically a welcome sight) and to run.<br /><br />He often visits his wife (or to-be wife) Clare Abshire throughout her adolescence. The love story starts for Clare when she's 6 (I know it sounds creepy, but it's not Lolita-y) and for Henry when he's 28. Or when he's 36. Time travel is usually confusing to describe. The more you think about it, the less it makes sense. Which is the way time travel always works, so as long as the basic rules make sense, you're good.<br /><br />Henry and Clare each narrate parts of the book, sometimes the same scene from each perspective, sometimes not. The two have equal time in the book, although the story is really Henry's. You hear a lot from Clare's point of view, but it's always about Henry. And Henry's been in her life since she was young, so in a way this makes sense. It also explains the title in that the book is about the time traveler and his wife. Neither character is particularly fleshed out apart from the relationship, although Clare has nothing without Henry. That was my biggest problem with the book. The title is apt because this isn't really about Clare. It's about Clare as the time traveler's wife.<br /><br />That said, I liked the book. This isn't a new favorite but it was much better than I expected and I'm happy I read it. It takes a different look about relationships, about the sacrifices made, the happiness and the pain.

I'm not admitting defeat. I am however putting it on a indefinite hiatus. Which is extra stupid because I'm on page 501 out of 536. But I just can't do it.<br /><br />I love fairy tales. I know I'm not alone in this. You know, obviously, given the title quote. So when I saw this book I got excited. New fairy tales? Please, continue. OK, they're not all new. They're all inspired by an established fairy tale. Some I know well (\"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen) and some that are completely new to me (\"The White Cat\" by Madame d'Aulnoy). The stories were collected by Kate Bernheimer and include works by Joyce Carol Oates, Neil Gaiman, Aimee Bender and a plethora of authors that I'd never heard of.<br /><br />I had a brief Twitter conversation with Ellen from <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Fat Books &amp; Thin Women</a> and Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> about short story collections. If there's some consistency in the stories, it's easier to get through, be it a similar topic, a similar writing style or both. This collection has a similar theme but by very different authors. The styles are very different, their treatment of the fairy tales very different. This means that some of the stories are great, some are no fun and most are meh. Or at least the most that I made it through.<br /><br />I always have trouble reviewing a collection of short stories, and even though in this case I'm not done with the book, I thought I'd write about what I made it through. Because I feel like I haven't written anything in awhile and I'm not letting this book defeat me like that. If the last stories turn out to be the most amazing thing ever, I'll make sure to note that. But for now all I can say is there wasn't enough I liked to make this collection work for me.<br /><br />The best thing to come out of it is the story by Neil Gaiman. I know I named some authors up above but I should point out I hadn't actually read anything by them before. I'd heard of them because of all the lovely book bloggers that have read them. Now I have their short fairy tale stories and reading Gaiman's makes me want to read more by him. His was a take on the Odyssey (which I feel is a lenient use of the term \"fairy tale\") but I don't really see the actual connection between Gaiman's version and the Greek epic (so it's a lenient use of The Odyssey).  However, I didn't even care. It's a strange story and involves a substance mistaken for fake tanner and aliens and it's told as a series of answers to questions you don't get to read.<br /><br />Good parts: Neil Gaiman's story. Bad parts: the boring stories which outnumbered the awesome ones.<br /><br />Title quote from xvii<br /><br />Bernheimer, Kate (ed).

This month they ask:<br /><br />How do you find time to read? What's you're reading style? Where do you think reading literature should rank in society's priorities?<br /><br />First up, how do you find time to read? <br />Since graduating college the majority of my reading has happened on public transportation. Commuting is not my favorite thing but at least it gives me a nice, (mostly) uninterrupted stretch of reading time. Plus a good book is a wonderful way to pretend I'm not squished between people of questionable hygiene in some metal tube. When I wasn't regularly commuting I had to work harder to find time to read, but that just meant reading instead of watching TV or playing on the internet or whatever else I could be doing. But I don't force myself to read. I don't want it to be a chore and if I'm not in the mood, I don't beat myself up over it.<br /><br />What's your reading style? <br />Umm left to right, typically.<br />If C-C at the Blue Bookcase hadn't already answered, I probably would have left my response at that cos I wasn't really sure what it's asking. I'm still not entirely sure. I don't like to write in books so I'm not making notes or underlining passages. At least not in physical books. I underline in my Kindle. I read for enjoyment, so I'm not normally reading something with a certain criticism style in mind or investigating every detail for a hidden meaning. I majored in English so I think I may just do some of that because it's what I spent all that time training to do, but it's not a conscious decision before picking up a book. It doesn't mean I'm just reading to escape, or I won't give deeper thought to things. It's just not my primary intention.<br /><br />Where do you think reading literature should rank in society's priorities?<br />This is an odd question. Are we counting things like stable economy, effective government, etc as part of society's priorities? Cos if so, while I LOVE reading, it's going to come near the bottom of that list. I want to make sure I'm alive and well and safe enough to do all that reading I want to do. However, if we're talking about our society's (and I mean the society of people who have an internet connection, the times, the means, the resources to read a book blog) entertainment priorities, then I think reading literature is up there. I love reading because it lets me look at the world in so many different ways, from so many different point of views and I think seeing the world in different ways is important for the individual and for society as a whole. Or else you grow stagnant and boring. And while I may enjoy some realty TV (damn you Hoarders), reading is still a priority. Which is why I normally read WHILE watching Hoarders. Multitasking, people.<br /><br />So what do you think? How do you find time to read? What's your reading style? Where does reading lit fall in terms of society's priorities?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:08+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:08+00:00","published_at":"2012-03-08T15:16:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e445dde22fdcf0004fa","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e455dde2223b6000112","title":"February Reading Wrap-Up","slug":"february-reading-wrap-up-1","url":"/articles/february-reading-wrap-up-1","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Feb+calendar.jpg\" />This month has been pretty nuts for me, in a good way. Previously I was working from home. Now I'm working in our office 3 days a week (my work has been super awesome letting me stay home a couple days, thanks to the crazy high commuting costs and the fact that all my work can be done as long as I have a phone and internet access). Yeah, the commute is long, BUT I now have lots of reading time.<br /><br />ALSO, before I get to the stats, it's Boyfriend's birthday today! I have a habit of missing birthdays.

I just don't always remember what day of the week/month it is. Instead of knowing what day it is, I've chosen to memorize the such culturally important things like obscure Simpsons characters and the full script to the made-for-tv biography called In Search of Dr. Seuss.

I mean I've wanted to read it for awhile. I've even picked it up a few times but I always put it back and grabbed something else. I was planning on reading My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me. And then I forgot it. I went to visit my mom for the holiday weekend and I realized I had left the book on the table but figured I never actually get any reading done when I'm visiting. We're always out running around or talking. It wasn't until we were too far to turn around that I realized while I may not get to read the book at my mom's, I did have about 2 hours of train travel. Can't do that without a book so I went to a bookstore and Zeitoun jumped out at me. I'm so glad it did.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Zeitoun+cover.jpg\" />I can't remember the last time a book made me so angry. Not at the book. I loved the book. But at what happens. I'm going to warn you now that this is going to be all kinds of spoilery. As spoilery as you can make a non-fiction book I suppose. If you don't want to read on, just know that I loved this and you should read it.<br /><br />I only knew the basics of the of the book when I picked it up: it's about Hurricane Katrina, it focuses on a single Muslim family, there is some unfair prison time. So when I started the book I was surprised at how happy it is, how much hope there is, how absurd and surreal things got in New Orleans during the flooding. Kathy and the kids evacuated the city while Zeitoun (it's his last name but people had trouble with his name Abdulrahman so he typically went by this) stayed behind to watch over the family painting company and check-in on their several rental properties. There's some tense scenes in the first part of the book while you find out exactly what sort of damage the hurricane and then flood caused to the Zeitoun home and Kathy's worry for her husband. But Zeitoun was fine. He had brought out a canoe and was spending his days paddling around his adopted city helping anyone he could. He rescued neighbors, kept some dogs fed, and generally made himself useful. He even found a working phone at one of their rental properties and made sure to call his wife daily. Whenever Kathy would beg him to come home he would tell her he felt like God had a plan for him, and he was supposed to be there helping people.<br /><br />There are scary moments, as the relief workers don't seem to be very helpful in actually offering relief and he does see a few gangs of looters, although they leave him alone. Really, the most upsetting thing in the first half was around Kathy. She was raised Southern Baptist but had converted to Islam before meeting Zeitoun and her family seemed to think of it as a phase (even several years later). That and Kathy's legitimate worry for Zeitoun. She's watching all of these awful things on the news about the conditions in New Orleans. And as she says, it's unfair that Zeitoun has the comfort of knowing his family is safe. Kathy and the kids don't have the same luxury. But really these are small things compared to what happens in the second half.<br /><br />I was started to get lulled into the idea that things weren't so bad. And that they wouldn't get bad. That it was a good thing Zeitoun hung around. I mean, he was doing so much good. But then came that unfair prison time.<br /><br />Zeitoun a few friends that had stayed in the city were at one of the rental properties when the police busted in and arrested everyone. No one was told what they were being arrested for, no one was read any rights, they weren't given any phone calls. They were just taken away. And then they were put in a jail for days. Weeks. In deplorable conditions. And still they never knew what they were being held for. Not officially anyway, although they were kept separate from all of the other prisoners and guards would mumble (or yell) Taliban and Al-Qaeda at the men. Two of the men were Muslim-Americans and two were white local boys. But apparently talking to Muslims was enough to count as being a terrorist in New Orleans after the hurricane.<br /><br />There is no excuse for what happened to Zeitoun and the other men and women who were unlawfully detained. No matter how bad conditions were during the flooding in New Orleans, there is no excuse for what these people went through. The fact that the Zeitoun family decided to go back to New Orleans speaks volumes of their character. I don't know if I could forgive the city if I had been in their shoes.<br /><br />There was one sort of funny scene during the prison time. Not so much funny-haha but more like \"are you kidding me?\" funny. The guards have put the suspected terrorists in one section, far from the other prisoners. Then one day they add a new guy to the cell named Jerry who is there to apparently get terrorist information from the guys. And he does it with all the subtly of: \"Oh man you guys, American sucks the big one, amirite? We should totally go all jihad on this place. Death to America, what what.\" Since Zeitoun and company are a) not terrorists and b) not idiots, they just ignore the guy until he's eventually removed from their group.<br /><br />This is going to be another book I start shoving into everyone's hands. I've already started telling some of my non-reader friends \"Look I know, you're not a big reader, but just shut up and read this one right now. Right now. Why are you still talking to me when you could be picking up a copy of this book?\"<br /><br />Title quote from page 124<br /><br />Eggers, Dave. Zeitoun.

I'm a sucker for legitimately funny books, and as Dan O'Brien at Cracked point out, <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-itE28099s-impossible-to-find-funny-books/\">funny books can be difficult to find</a>.g Plus it's Black History Month so this seems to be a good time to read a book titled How To Be Black. It's what Thurston expects:<br /><blockquote>\"The odds are high that you acquired this book during the nationally sanctioned season for purchasing black cultural objects, also known as Black History Month. That's part of the reason I chose February as the publication date. If you're like most people, you buy one piece of black culture per year during this month, and I'm banking on this book jumping out at you from the bookshelf or screen\". </blockquote>How well you know me, sir.<br /><br />The book is partially a memoir of Thurston's life growing up and experiences being black: being the black friend in a predominately white school (Sidwell Friends for middle/high school and later Harvard), being the black guy in the office and in general being black in America. Thurston has also assembled a Black Panel, people who \"do blackness well\", plus the author of Stuff White People Like to establish a control group and defend against arguments against reverse discrimination. They help weigh in on important topics such as \"How to Be The Black Friend\" and\" How to Speak for All Black People\" as well as answer questions such as \"Can You Swim?\" and \"How's That Post-Racial Thing Working Out for Ya?\" (All of those are also chapter titles, hence the capitalization.)  This book chronicles the experiences and search for identity of a single person. Don't expect this to be a general discussion of what it is to be black. I'm not sure a book like that could actually exist, even if another book may claim to do just that. I mean obviously this book is claiming that but this book is a satire.<br /><br />Race is a difficult thing to talk about and humor is a great way to confront uncomfortable topics. And the book is hilarious. Not only that but it can get the conversation started. It may not be a happy conversation, but without it there is no progress. May as well laugh during the conversation.<br /><br />Obviously I spend a lot of time here recommending books, but I don't do it too much in real life. Not with this book. I've been insisting a friend of mine read this as well as shoving my copy into Boyfriend's hands. Let that be part of my insistence that you also check this out. I mean, if you are going to buy just one piece of black culture this month, no reason it can't be hilarious.<br /><br />Separate, sort of unrelated to the book over all, but this is my blog so I wanted to write about this quote:<br /><blockquote>\"My mother and I tried to visit Northeastern University but couldn't find it for the longest time. In the search process, we came across the intersection of Tremont Street and Tremont Street. I'm not kidding. If you wonder why Boston drivers are so famously terrible, consider that they have to navigate space-time paradoxes like this, and cut them some slack.\"</blockquote>1. Here is an example of the tone of the book and Thurston's sense of humor.<br />2. I went to Northeastern so WOOO for the mention, even if it's the fact that he couldn't find it. It's right near the Symphony and the Museum of Fine Arts if you want to sound fancy. Or near Mission Hill, if you want to be less fancy.<br />3. I have stood at that intersection of Tremont St and Tremont St going \"Oh Boston, you magnificent idiot. What is this?\" Nexus of the universe and what not. So he's not just making this up to make fun of Boston. Boston roads just make that little sense.<br />4. Boston drivers are as bad as you have heard and then some. And then a little more.<br /><br />This article got him a free copy of Christopher Moore's new book Sacre Bleu which makes me hella jealous. And I also feel a little stalkerish knowing that, but it's not my fault I happen to follow them both on Twitter.<br /><br />Title quote from location 208<br /><br />Thurston, Baratunde.

I don't have a problem with any of these, but they aren't for me. But Warner's book stuck out because satire! Use of the absurd! These are things I like to hear. Plus, as I found out later Ben over at <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> also was reading it so that was just another check in the plus column for this one.<br /><br />The book is about Cal Lyte, a gun-loving Libertarian and businessman. His ex-wife is running for Arizona senate and is trying to squeeze Cal for more alimony money. Cal recruits his daughter's boyfriend, the academic Reid, to help him dig up dirt on Tabytha. Things naturally (because it's a book and there needs to be a plot) spin out of control and get more and more bizarre.<br /><br />There are wonderful moments where things are absurd, but just realistic enough so you could believe someone could do or say those things. A couple examples:<br /><ul><li>Cal's voicemail message is the sound of a fetal heartbeat. He's VERY pro-life. </li></ul><ul><li>Most of what comes out of Tabytha's mouth, such as \"As we plan the rebuilding of America, I like to look at this replica of  the derringer that killed Abraham Lincoln, to remind me that not even a  President can violate the Constitution with impunity\"</li></ul><ul><li>A colleague of Reid's at the university has been spending most of his career \"analyzing continuity errors in Casablanca\".</li></ul> That said, the tone of the book felt uneven. It strayed at points where it lost the humor and the satire and felt like a straightforward thriller perhaps? I'm not really sure how it would have been categorized. Anyway. It always came back, but when it wandered, it wandered too far. Part of this could be due to the dual narrators of Reid and Cal. Cal is the primary narrator but Reid has a chapter here and there that breaks up the momentum. It's fun to see Reid's point of view on academia, but it would have been better if it was all Cal.<br /><br />This part has spoilers. But it was my favorite part of the book so decide if you should venture in<br />My favorite part of the book, the part that tipped over into ridiculous came near the end: Cal goes down to Mexico to hang out on a friend's boat for awhile and take a little vacation. When he gets down there he gets kidnapped by revolutionaries. A revolutionary group that calls itself \"el Frente Nuevo Revolucionario Unido Guevarista-Zapatista Popular y Antiimperialista por el Liberacion Indigena Internacional\" or \"FNRUGZPALII\" for short. Naturally. They're sort of new at the whole \"revolutionary\" thing and can't even decide if they should hold Cal for ransom or just have him hang around. They only owns one firearm as \"there was disagreement within the group regarding the permissible uses of violence in a revolutionary context\". I think I just like the idea of the theoretical revolutionaries. They have the academic ideas, but no experience in the matter.<br />Spoilers contained<br /><br />I was going to say the first books I accepted from an author but that's not really true. Anthony Neil Smith sent me Choke On Your Lies and Yellow Medicine after I wrote a review of Hogdoggin'. And that book was given to me by Ben. I probably should have included some note about those facts in those posts, but I didn't. Whoops.<br /><br />Separate question from the post, but what do you guys do with review offers if you don't want the book? Do you ignore the email? Respond and say no thanks? Respond with a tirade about how the book is nothing like what you like and clearly that person doesn't really read your site? <br /><br />Title quote from location 1230<br /><br />Warner, James.

Fforde Tweeted a couple weeks ago that the lastest Thursday book One of Our Thursdays is Missing was out in paperback. Well, I can't turn that down. So I went to the local bookstore and they had a copy and I can't have an unread Fforde book sitting around. Another Fforde it was.<br /><br />The Thursday Next series is my favorite book series and this is the latest addition. Thursday is missing! No one in the BookWorld or the RealWorld knows where she is but there are some tense times between Women's Fiction and Racy Novel and Thursday is needed for the peace talks. She has a lot of enemies so who knows where she's gone. There is hope though: the written Thursday! She's like the real Thursday except not quite as smart. Or as quick. Or as good with a gun. She wasn't her hippie, granola-loving self she was in Thursday Next: First Among Sequels which was good, but I still missed Thursday.<br /><br />Like the other Thursday books, or really any Fforde books, they're hard to describe to someone who isn't already familiar with the world. In the map of BookWorld, the Thursday books fall into the \"speculative fanatasy\" neighborhood, which borders on Dickens and Tolkein rip-offs, according to the BookWorld map. They're absurd and punny, with science and crime fiction making their way in. There is a lot of literary humor and I'm sure I missed a lot of it. But considering I loved The Eyre Affair and read it several times before ever reading Jane Eyre, knowing all of the literary references is not necessary.<br /><br />I want to compliment Fforde on his ability to take a character, written Thursday Next, who is virtually identical to real Thursday Next and make her different enough so you can tell you're not dealing with the original. Unfortunately, I missed the original. Written Thursday is almost Thursday, but not quite. And I wanted her to be the real Thursday. Of course if I had the real Thursday then the book would have been \"One of our Thursdays is missing! What? No? She's actually just right over there. Nevermind then!\"<br /><br />Overall not the best in the series (The Well of Lost Plots is still my favorite), but it was still nice to go back to BookWorld.<br /><br />Title quote from page 180<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper.

I had been working from home for awhile, but I'm now working in the office. Yay for plenty of reading time during the commute, but boo because I seem to have less time for actual blogging. At least while I get into the new routine. (Also boo for having to wear non-pajama pants/ripped jeans on a regular basis.)  I finished a book (yay) but haven't had time yet to write a post about it (boo) so instead I figured I'd play this.<br /><br />Here's how this works<br />1. Post rules. (Got it)<br />2. Post 11 fun facts about yourself. (I like talking about myself so no problem)<br />3. Answer questions from the person who tagged you. (11 MORE questions. K)<br />4. Make up 11 questions for people you tag. (Gah 11 new questions? We'll see)<br />5. Tag 11 people. (What? That won't happen. I'll tag some, and for those of you I do tag, you're free to ignore me.)<br />6. Let them know they've been tagged.<br /><br />11 \"Fun\" Facts About Me (I don't know how much fun these actually are but here we go)<br /><br />1. I used to snowboard. I was part of the ski club from 5th-12th grade and we'd go to a mountain every Friday during the season. (I skied the first 3 years, snowboarded the other 5.) One of my criteria for a university was it had to be close enough to mountains to go snowboarding, one of the reasons I stuck to Boston (instead of a warmer city). I have been snowboarding all of 3 times since high school. I'm bad at following through with this.<br />2. I'm comically clumsy. I walk into walls, fall up stairs, all the time. I've actually given myself a black eye before. And I once broke my own finger. I (assumed) I jammed it playing volleyball. When it still hurt a couple hours later a friend suggested I pull on it to fix it. Solid logic! Turns out it wasn't so much jammed, but it was now broken.<br />3. When I was little I wanted to be a paleontologist. I was stupidly excited when Jurassic Park came out.<br />4. I loved sharks when I was little. My first and favorite book was The Golden Book of Sharks and Whales. Now? I'm terrified of sharks. Don't know when that happened, but yup.<br />5. I love reading (obviously, with the book blog and all) but I hardly ever use libraries. I can't remember the last time I took out a non-reference book from a library. I'm going to assume elementary school. I know, I know. I'd just rather own the book.<br />6. I work pseudo-tech support. I even sit with IT now. Keep in mind when calling tech support, if you make silly mistakes and don't understand things but are nice, I don't care and I will help you as fast as I can. If you are rude, I will make fun of you and move as slowly as possible.<br />7. I'm not a fan of hardback books. I think they look nice on a shelf and all, but I hate actually reading them. They're heavy and my hand gets sore holding them.<br />This is the point where I stop being able to figure out \"fun\" things about me, so things are about to get less interesting.<br />8. My profile picture is me at Niagra Falls. This isn't cropped to cut out the whole point of bringing your camera. Boyfriend just took a picture of the back of my head. Weirdo. Then I used it for my blog. Double weirdo.<br />9. I read both Les Mis and The Hunchback of Notre Dame when I was in middle school because of musicals (Broadway and Disney, to be specific). I understood roughly none of them. I should probably re-read those.<br />10. I've been to an Olympic men's hockey game. I watched Sweden whoop the US in the Torino games. I was studying in Italy.<br />11. Despite the red hair, freckles and pale skin I'm not Irish. I am Italian, French, Czech, Hungarian, English &amp; Scottish.<br /><br />Questions from Bev:<br />1. Fav childhood book-related memory: Probably reading my dad's copy of On Beyond Zebra by Dr. Seuss. He even made up his own character at the end of the book.<br />2. If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would you go? There are so many places I'd like to go: New Zealand, France, Japan, back to Italy. Hopefully I'll be able to make it out to North Ireland soon to visit my friend.<br />3. Best present you ever received: This question is stressful because nothing is immediately coming to mind and I feel like even if I do come up with something I'm probably going to offend someone for not saying their gift. Boyfriend got me the soundtrack to Avenue Q plus tickets to the show, that was pretty sweet.<br />4. A song that you could sing the lyrics to right NOW: So many. It's pathetic how much brain space I've given over to song lyrics instead of important things like friends' birthdays. I had \"The Humans Are Dead\" by The Flight of the Conchords stuck in my head earlier<br />5. Who was your first friend? Are you still friends? I suppose my friend friend was my neighbor James. He lived next door to me when I was very little and our families became friends. I haven't seen him in a few years though, which is too bad. I should fix that.<br />6. Do you collect anything? If so, what and how did you get started? I'd say books but that doesn't feel like a collection. I guess I'd have to say music boxes. My grandmother used to get me one every year for Christmas. Some of them are currently sitting in a box in our (unpacked) living room. The rest are in my mom's basement.<br />7. What is the title of the book that's closest to you right now? Well my Kindle is next to me so lots of books. I was last reading All Her Father's Guns on it though, so I guess that.<br />8. Are you a morning person or a night owl? I used to be more of a night person but now that work requires me to get up early I can't stay up late anymore.<br />9. Do you live in a city, the suburbs or the country? I now live in the suburbs and while I do like our new neighborhood a lot, I miss the city. One day I hope to move back. I just need roughly all the money to live in NYC.<br />10. Have you ever met somebody famous? Who? Nope. At least I can't think of anyone. And I'll assume since I can't think of anyone then they weren't they famous.<br />11. What would a perfect day be like for you? It would include a relaxing day, hanging out in NYC (maybe some reading in Central Park), eating some good food. Actually the food is the most important part. Good food can go a long way to making a good day.<br /><br />Now for me to tag some people<br />Alice from <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Reading Rambo</a><br />Laura from <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/\">Devouring Texts</a><br />Meg from <a href=\"http://theterribledesire.blogspot.com/\">The Terrible Desire</a><br />Brenna from <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musings</a><br />Jennifer from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a><br />Sarah from <a href=\"http://sarahsaysread.com/\">Sarah Says Read</a><br /><br />Thought I was done, but now I need to come up with questions for you guys.<br />1.

And what better read than Jasper Fforde's The Big Over Easy?<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Big+Over+Easy+cover.jpg\" />In a spin-off of the Thursday Next series, we have Nursery Crimes. It's a police division, lead by Jack Spratt (can eat no fat, has a problem with giants) that deals with crimes concerning nursery rhyme characters. Even though this is clearly the most awesome crime division, NCD is chronically underfunded and understaffed. One of the main problems is Jack is having getting his cases written about in one of the real-crime magazines, made famous by the various Sherlock Holmes adventures. Justice is all well and good, but the most important thing is to make sure you have an interesting story, preferably with lots of seemingly insignificant clues that turn out to solve the case. And since Jack was unable to win his latest case, Mr. Wolff vs the Three Pigs, NCD is in more trouble than normal. Here's an example<br /><blockquote>Since the death by scalding of Mr. Wolff following his ill-fated climb down Little Pig C's chimney, we at the Nursery Crime Division have been following inquiries that this was not an act of self-defense, but a violent and premeditated murder by three individuals who, far from being the innocent victims of wolf-porcine crime, actually sought confrontation and then acted quite beyond what might be described as reasonable self-defense. 10</blockquote>As with any Fforde book, it's tough to describe the books and make them sound like anything other than a mash up of genres. Which is what the book is, if the whole Nursery Crime title didn't clue you in. And while that could end up a big confusing mess in lesser hands, Fforde knows exactly how to handle things so you stick with the story, no matter how ridiculous it gets. It's hilarious and witty and a murder mystery.  How can a page turner like that not break someone of their reading slump?<br /><br />I know this review is mostly gushing but I also kind of don't care about that.

I had no motivation to read to read and was feeling down about it. And in my head I was thinking \"What if I never feel like reading?\" because being over-dramatic is a specialty of mine. So thank you for telling me to take a deep breath, continue watching mindless TV or playing games or whatever and read again when you feel like it. Now, review time!<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shakespeare+World+as+Stage+cover.jpg\" />Bryson and Shakespeare. It's like peanut butter and banana. I love both those things and when you put them together there is extra happiness. I was so excited when I first saw that Bill Bryson wrote Shakespeare: The World as Stage that I didn't even wait for it to come out in paperback, as I normally do. I needed this book and I needed it NOW. Or rather THEN! Because this all happened in the past.<br /><br />Bryson brings the wit I love to this Shakespeare biography. He's not a Shakespeare scholar which makes this very accessible for the casual fang. Or the more avid fan who wants something straightforward.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Shakespeare: we don't really know that much about the guy. Which makes sense when you think about how long ago Shakespeare was around writing and how much time that has provided for documents and details to get lost. As archivist David Thomas says \"The documentation for William Shakespeare is exactly what you would expect of a person of his position from that time...It seems like a dearth only because we are so intensely interested in him. In fact we know more about Shakespeare than about almost any other dramatist of his age\" (17). While it may be nice to know that we know more about him than other playwrights of his day, that doesn't exactly fill out a biography. Bryson chooses to focus on what we do know, makes clear what we don't know, and looks as the suppositions that are both logical and far-fetched. There's not a lot to go on so it makes sense this book is short.<br /><br />There's a lot about life in Elizabethan/Jacobean England because of the whole we-don't-know-a-lot-about-Shakespeare thing. But we do have information about the time so we can get a better idea of the world Shakespeare inhabited, even if we don't know much about the man. And we really don't know the man. There are 3 images of Shakespeare: 1 engraving done after he had died by an artist that may have never seen Shakespeare, a good portrait that may not be of Shakespeare, and a statue that had all of the details whitewashed away in the 1700s. We only have six of Shakespeare's signatures and in none of them is his name spelled \"Shakespeare\".<br /><br />I don't know that it's important to know who Shakespeare was. You can certainly enjoy his plays and poems without knowing anything about the guy. I mean, really, that's what people are doing now. But it would be nice to have more information. Since we don't have that, it's nice that this slim biography is funny.<br /><br />One quick note, Bryson mentions how free form writing/spelling was in Shakespeare's day. I never really appreciated this until I took a 16th Century Lit class in college. I assume in a move to justify the large microfilm library the university has, we had to find a piece of 16th century lit not previously published and write a paper on it. I ended up stumbling on a poem that it would seem served as a source for Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew called \"A Merry Jest of a Shrewde and Curste Wyfe, Lapped in Morrell's Skin, For Her Good Behavyour\" because Shakespeare stuff just finds me. Don't think the spelling in that title is any indication of how difficult it is to read something from this time, in the original text. This wasn't a very long poem (thank God) but it took me a good 8 hours of intense reading to figure out what was written. Every letter could actually be 6 different letters and the same word would be spelled multiple ways on a single page. It's like they were purposefully trying to piss of future readers, which is kind of hilarious if you're not writing a paper. Also don't read that poem because it is not only a bad story (woman is flayed and then wrapped in a salted horses hide to break her) but it's badly written as well.<br /><br />Unlike a certain Shakespearean scholar who's book took me over a month to finish.

Not books anyway. Not for at least the last week. I've managed to do a decent job keeping up with blogs and Cracked, but I haven't picked up a book. I have books to read, but I can't get into them. And I don't think it's the books' faults. I mean I haven't read them yet, so it's not cos the books are bad.<br /><br />First it was packing up for the move. I'm not particularly organized nor do I do things ahead of time, which just served to stress me out. Then last week Boyfriend and I spent our free time after work driving out to the new place and painting before we moved the furniture in, which was a great except each night we got home late and we were exhausted. I didn't have the energy for reading, though I did muster the energy to watch Archerg but that takes a lot less effort.<br /><br />Now it's been unpacking. And that is going slowly, again because of the disorganized and laziness factors. It's better than packing, no question, but I have only a vague idea of where all my stuff is. I know it's in a box somewhere. Probably. Also we don't have a couch yet. We're getting a new couch and it will be awesome and perfect for reading. But in the meantime we have a couple of beach chairs sitting in the living room and I've found they are way more conducive to reading when you're actually sitting on a beach.<br /><br />I was planning on reading All Her Father's Guns but I think I need something I've already read before to get me back into the swing of reading. And not just any re-read, but something I've read a number of times and already put in the effort so now I can sit back and enjoy the ride. I'm thinking Jasper Fforde's The Big Over-Easy because I've read it a few times and it's hilarious, and also because it's sort of crime/noir-esque (except, you know, with nursery rhyme characters) so it will hopefully get me in the mood to tackle something from the Smooth Criminals reading challenge.

I just finished up Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, which is my Classic Play pick for <a href=\"http://www.sarahreadstoomuch.com/2011/11/announcing-back-to-classics-challenge.html\">Sarah's Classics reading challenge</a>.Also this sort of counts for Allie's Shakespeare Reading Month even if I'm not actually participating in it. But everyone else was reading Shakespeare and I wanted in on the action. (I cannot withstand blogging peer pressure, even when it's indirect.)<br /><br />Now, I can't review Shakespeare. I am not smart enough for that. So instead of even making an attempt I've instead decided to give you a couple of my thoughts about Twelfth Night. I also wrote a plot description at the bottom of the post in case you're not familiar with story and want to follow along.<br /><br />Random thoughts about Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or What You Will:<br /><br />First Orsino is super taken with Viola/Cesario. I mean, he does make her a super trusted servant and messenger-of-love not long after meeting her. Then Olivia lays eyes on her and instantly decides \"What the whole mourning-dead-family-so-I-can't-love-anyone-right-now thing? That's nothing. I just had to keep the weirdos away. Now come here you!\" Is really Viola just that awesome?<br /><br />Sir Andrew and Sir Toby are the best characters, although better to watch than to read. They provide most of the comic relief, which is kind of a weird thing to have in what is a comedy. But the Orsino/Viola/Olivia story isn't super funny. Or funny at all really, except I guess the whole \"Olivia being in love with Cesario who is really a girl!\" The two cowardly drunks, however, are hilarious.<br /><br />When Malvolio gets the letter from \"Olivia\" he says it has to be from her because he recognizes her hand-writing. \"By my life, this is my lady's hand! These be her very c's, her u's, and her t's.\" (II.v.88-90). Two things about this: Shakespeare is careful about the words he picks, so that must extend to letters and the guy was all about the sex jokes. This is the take Dr. Pauline Kiernan, author of Filthy Shakespeare, believes. \"'Cut' is slang for cunt; the word 'and' was pronounced as an 'n'.\" Also if you say \"c's, her u's and her t's\" fast it sounds like you're saying \"c,u,n,t\". (pg 62) It's a classy cunt joke.<br /><br />Sebastian is found by this guy Antonio, who seems to be in love with Sebastian even if my Folger's copy won't admit it. It also only vaguely acknowledged the dirty joke above, so I think it likes to keep things clean. Not <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bowdlerize\">bowdlerized </a>but just classroom appropriate. Folger can tell me all it wants that when Antonio tells Sebastian \"There shall you have me\" (III.iii.46) he means \"You will find me there\", but it's not convincing me that's all he means. Later he comes to Viola/Cesario's defense during her duel with Sir Andrew, thinking she's Sebastian. When she tells him she has no idea who he is, Antonio is deeply hurt. Now you could argue he's mad because earlier he had given Sebastian his purse full of money and now he's asking Viola for that money and she's refusing, but he hardly seems to care about the money. \"This youth that you see here/I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,/Relieved him with such sanctity of love,/And to his image, which methought did promise/Most venerable worth, did I devotion\" (III.iv.378-382) Pretty much any scene with Antonio has him declaring his love for Sebastian. And Sebastian is clearly oblivious. Or he doesn't swing that way but I'm going with oblivious (maybe a little dumb too) given the whole marrying Olivia thing. I feel so bad for Antonio.<br /><br />Plot!<br />Viola and her twin brother Sebastian's ship is caught in a storm, and they each wash up on shore thinking the other sibling is dead. Viola disguises herself as a boy Cesario (so in the original stage productions it would be a boy, playing a woman, playing a man. Not confusing at all.) and seeks refuge as Count/Duke Orsino's servant. Orsino is in love with Countess Oliva, who refuses to love anyone until she finishes mourning her brother's and father's deaths. Which seems kind of reasonable, but Orsino wants the love now! Orsino sends Viola/Cesario to court Oliva on his behalf, but Oliva falls in love with Viola/Cesario. Meanwhile, Viola/Cesario has fallen in love with Orsino, but can't tell him cos she's dressed as a boy. Love triangle!<br /><br />Oliva has suitors other than Orsino: Sir Andrew and her servant Malvolio (although his is more a secret crush). Sir Andrew is friends with Oliva's kinsman the drunk Sir Toby, who mostly keeps Andrew around because he wants his money. And a drinking buddy. And Sir Andrew is pretty wimpy and easy to boss around. Malvolio doesn't care for Sir Toby and Sir Andrew's drunken revelry and is also kind of douchey snob. Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Oliva's lady-in-waiting Maria plan a trick on Malvolio because he interrupted their drinking and that must be punished. They leave him a letter supposedly from Oliva professing her love for him, and telling him that if he loves her back he should profess his love by smiling at her a lot, wearing ridiculous clothes, and being mean to Sir Toby and company. He follows the letter to the T and Oliva thinks he's gone mad and has him locked up. <br /><br />Sir Andrew sees that Olivia is love with Viola/Cesario and decides he should give up and go. Sir Toby doesn't like that he's going to lose his cash cow and drinking buddy, so he convinces Sir Andrew to challenge Olivia to a duel. But Sir Andrew is a wimp and Viola/Cesario is actually a lady, which in this play anyway means she can't fight. Not like \"I'm not allowed because of my lady like disposition\" but because (apparently) \"My uterus makes me unable to know how to fight.\" Or maybe Viola/Cesario just sucks at fighting but whatever the reason, these scenes are pretty great.<br /><br />Meanwhile! Viola's twin brother Sebastian is alive and has been hanging out with a man named Antonio, who totally has a thing for Sebastian, even if we're not acknowledging it, Folgers New Shakespeare Library. Antonio comes to Viola/Cesario's aid during the duel, thinking he's Sebastian. Antonio isn't exactly welcome in these parts and he's arrested. Earlier Antonio had given Sebastian a purse full of money and now he asks Viola/Cesario for that money back. Viola/Cesario has no idea what he's talking about, Antonio's heart is broken and he's taken away.<br /><br />Another meanwhile! Sebastian runs into Olivia who thinks he's Viola/Cesario and proposes marriage. Sebastian doesn't know who she is but goes with it anyway because why not? They even get the betrothal sanctified by a priest. Then Sebastian runs into Sir Andrew and Sir Toby, who challenge him to a duel again, thinking it will go a lot like last time (meaning it won't happen at all). Sebastian is apparently super impulsive because not only does he agree to marry Olivia upon first meeting her, but he also has no problem beating the hell out of the two drunk knights without figuring out why they're so angry.<br /><br />Orsino and Viola/Cesario go to Olivia's so Orsino can give his Olivia-wooing one more try. Antonio shows up and yells about how he gave Sebastian all this love and Sebastian pretended not to know who he was. But he's yelling all of this at Viola/Cesario, who is just all sorts of confused. Then Olivia comes out and talks about how excited she is that she and Cesario are going to get married, and again Viola/Cesario is confused and denies this. Now Orsino, Olivia and Antonio are all angry at Viola/Cesario, who has no idea what's going on. Then Sir Toby and Sir Andrew come in all beat up and there are more people yelling at Viola/Cesario. Then Sebastian stumbles in, doesn't seem to notice his twin standing RIGHT THERE (he's both impulsive and unobservant) although everyone else does. Viola reveals she's really a lady and declares her love for Orsino who figures Olivia's already taken so Viola's a good consolation prize. Olivia is likewise pretty OK with marrying someone that looks a lot like the lady/guy she was actually in love with and even keeps calling Sebastian Cesario because this is a totally non-doomed relationship. And everyone lives happily ever after except Malvolio who vows revenge on everyone for his mistreatment. The End.<br /><br />Title quote from I.i.1<br /><br />Kiernan, Pauline.

So please forgive me if I mess up some of the details cos at this point it feels like a million years ago when I finish this book.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Solitude+of+Prime+Numbers+cover.jpg\" />I can't remember who recommended it, but someone mentioned that The Solitude of Prime Numbers by Paolo Giordano was a good literary book for typically non-literary readers. Since the new year I've felt like I've been in a reading slump (and judging by a number of posts I've seen, others are feeling the same way) so I was looking for something \"literary light\" to pull me in. And then I saw a copy of the book on sale at the Booksmith, so I had to pick up it. Obviously.<br /><br />It's an odd story. There are two primary narrators: Alice and Mattia. We catch up with them at various points in their lives, before they meet, once they've become close, after they've grown apart and then when they're brought back together again. They're both damaged in their own ways and find something in each other that's missing from every other relationship they have. As Giordano describes<br /><blockquote>\"Mattia had learned that, among prime numbers, there are some that are even more special. Mathematicians call them twin primes: pairs of prime numbers that are close to each other, almost neighbors, but between them there is always an even number that prevents them from truly touching.\" (111)</blockquote>One major problem I have with this book is I never feel like I get to know the characters. Even though we're seeing Alice's and Mattia's thoughts I never understood them anymore than the other characters did. No matter how much time you spend with them, you still never know them. At one point I thought Alice was acting out of character, against what Giordano had oringially set upg. But the more I tried to think \"how would Alice have acted\" I realized I have no idea. This could be entirely within how she would behave. Of course by this point I was about 75% through the book, so I'd like to think by now I have an idea what the characters are about. This was especially evident with Alice's chapters. You'd read something from her point of view and she was sullen and quiet and afraid. Then you see her in a Mattia chapter and she'd be loud and boisterous and bossy. And it isn't just be because Mattia viewed her this way in comparison to his own behavior (silent, morose). The few chapters from a secondary character would have Alice behaving the same way. It was almost like a different character.<br /><br />That said, it was still a book that sucked me in, which was especially welcome when on public transportation. The back of the book called it \"a stunning meditation on loneliness, love and what it means to be human.\" I agree with the loneliness. It does this beautifully (and heart-breakingly well). I will concede to love and what it means to be human, but within the confines of loneliness.<br /><br />One thing I'm curious about (and 6 seconds of Googling didn't answer) is if this book was originally written in English or not. There's no translator listed anywhere, yet it seems the book was originally written in Italian. Wikipedia lists the original title as \"La solitudine dei numeri primi\". So if someone knows what the deal is (maybe Giordano did his own translation?) please share.<br /><br />I have no problem assuming it's the author who made a mistake with how their character reacted instead of thinking I'm wrong. It's a special level of hubris I've cultivated.<br /><br />Title quote from page 222<br /><br />Giordano, Paolo. The Solitude of Prime Numbers.

My mother swears she's one of the only parents who had to tell her son not to read. Even back in elementary school, I'd spend every moment I could reading. I'd run the shower, then sit on the bath mat and steal another chapter or four. I would stay up well past my bedtime, first reading under the covers with a flashlight, and then\u2014once all the flashlights in the house had been confiscated\u2014I put a towel under the door to hide the overhead light. I became an expert at closing my eyes just enough to be able to see through my eyelashes yet have them convincingly appear closed[3]. Even in fourth grade I would regularly be up past midnight reading[4].<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Paolo-books.jpg\" />I still love to read, but usually feel like I don't have the time to do so. Between teaching, coaching, getting married, grad school, fixing up the house, and watching Arrested Development for the 15th time, I find too many excuses not to read. I let myself be talked into this challenge to combat that. <br /><br />I'm currently on the 8th Canto of Inferno[5].

The poetry? Yup! The plays? Want! The mystery of the man? Yeah sure, pile that on.<br /><br />I can remember the moment that I fell in love with Shakespeare's plays.g I was in my high school English class and we were reading Romeo and Juliet. It was my first time reading Shakespeare, although I knew the basics of the story because who doesn't? Plus Baz Lurhman's movie had come out a few years earlier. But actually reading the stuff? I was not having this Shakespeare guy. I could not for the life of me understand what was going on. I have always been a reader and I had tackled difficult literature before (I had read The Hunchback of Notre Dame in the 7th grade, even if I didn't understand anything), but this was a different world. I thought I could handle Shakespeare, no problem. And then I couldn't. I could read the words, even understand several of them, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what was actually happening. I decided Shakespeare really wasn't for me. And then there was the speech.<br /><br />For the most part we were reading the play for homework and then coming into class to discuss it. I'm sure we read a few scenes together, but the only one I remember is Juliet's speech from <a href=\"http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=romeojuliet&amp;Act=4&amp;Scene=3&amp;Scope=scene\">IV.iii.2565-2610</a> where she is about to drink the potion Friar Lawrence has given her to make it look like she's dead. Maybe it caught my attention because the teacher read it and she actually understands the text, instead of one of the students doing it. Maybe it's because this speech isn't a romantic one but instead has Juliet talk about bashing her brains in with the bones of her relatives. Whatever it was, I quit seeing this as outdated text with unrelatable characters. This was a vulnerable and scared girl trying to be brave. I was having so much trouble getting past the language and the period references, but this speech cut right through all of that. Yes, the text can be hard to read and there are a lot of words that aren't used anymore or are completely different now, but once you get past all of that the emotion beneath is real and universal.<br /><br />I was lucky that after that class I had other teachers as enthusiastic about Shakespeare as my frosh teacher. (And I had her again my senior year, which was sweet). Plus my high school had a Shakespeare class, to continue my obsession.<br /><br />Or at least I have a memory of a single moment. Whether I actually came out of class with a new world view, or whether that's just a romanticized notion is up for debate. Debate being, this is probably BS and I'm sure while I fondly remember this now, at the time it was just another day.<br /><br />Does anyone know if this speech has a pithy name, like Hamlet's \"What a piece of work is man\" speech? That would make it way easier to describe.<br /><br />All the romantic stuff wasn't resonating with me because I was an obnoxious, cynical child. I'm lucky to have grown out of that and now I'm an obnoxious, cynical adult. Ahh, maturity.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:15+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:15+00:00","published_at":"2012-01-17T14:24:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e4b5dde2264190005e8","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Shakespeare","slug":"shakespeare","url":"/articles/tags/shakespeare"}]}]},{"id":"53224e4b5dde2264190005e9","title":"Sometimes being feared is an educational thing","slug":"sometimes-being-feared-is-an-educational-thing","url":"/articles/sometimes-being-feared-is-an-educational-thing","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Yellow+Medicine+cover.jpg\" />Back in August I read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/there-was-no-after-only-end\">Hogdoggin'</a> by Anthony Neil Smith. Now in January of the next year and I'm finally getting around to the first book, Yellow Medicine. I suppose it would make the most sense to have read these in order, but why would I do something that makes sense? And because I read the sequel first, I can't help but think of the first book as a prequel. Whether that changes the way I viewed the book or not I guess I don't really know but I may as well put it out there.<br /><br />Like Hogdoggin' and the other Smith book I read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/but-there-was-no-way-to-turn-back\">Choke On Your Lies</a>, this story is a tense, violent and graphic crime story. Billy Lafitte is a dirty cop. He may mean well, his actions may be to keep his town safe, but he's not a Batmang vigilante doing the right thing above all else, even if it means breaking the law. He takes kickbacks from meth dealers, he (almost) trades sex with a college student in return for not busting her on some minor drug possession, he is far from an angel. Think of him like Vic Mackey from The Shield. Except I liked Vic Mackey, even though I knew he was awful. I didn't like Lafitte. And I expected to because I liked the guy in the sequel. Characters talked about his charisma repeatedly but I just saw him as a scumbag that had moments of morality. Also there's a point where he's described as having \"a full mustache and 'burns, something about the seventies\" which really doesn't help dispel the creepy scumbag factor.<br /><br />Please don't let this make you think I disliked the book. I didn't like Lafitte, but I liked the story. I expected to like Lafitte, not only because I liked him in Hogdoggin', but also because the book is from Lafitte's point of view. Generally when that happens you tend to sympathize with your narrator, even when you hate what they're doing. Consider it Narrative Stockholm Syndrome. But I thought the structure of Yellow Medicine, having a single narrator instead of several, worked better for the story. It kept the tension up instead of jumping around so much. And there's a lot of tension. Murders, meth dealers, gangs, terrorists. What's not to love?<br /><br />It was a little bit hard to believe how much Lafitte was willing to risk for the Drew. He's drawn into everything because she asks him to help her out and that little favor snowballs, but that only explained the beginning. As the story went on I never felt like I saw anything that showed me how much he cared for Drew. He said it a number of times, and it was his reason for getting deeper and deeper into the chaos, but it always felt like an excuse. Like he would have done it anyway and was justifying this to us. Or himself. But this is a small complaint.<br /><br />It's hard for me to say which I liked better: Yellow Medicine or Hogdoggin'. I like the first-person structure of Yellow Medicine and I thought it worked better to keep tensions high. But I LOVED the ending of Hogdoggin'. Loved it. That did a lot. In the end, both are good, tight crime stories.<br /><br />As soon as I said prequel I thought of Batman Begins. It's not that the book reminded me of Batman at all; it's that my own ramblings did.<br />Yes, yes, having a mustache doesn't make someone a scumbag but really, if you were to equate facial hair with certain personality traits, mustache would def be swinging towards the creep factor. Or '70s porn factor. But there are exceptions to this. Ron Swanson for example. Lafitte is not Ron Swanson.<br /><br />Title quote from location 1055<br /><br />Smith, Anthony Neil. Yellow Medicine.

I feel like someone recently talked about it on their blog, but I can't remember. I do know that I was up in Boston for a weekend and made several trips to the Brookline Booksmith, my former local indie bookstore. This book was sitting on one of those \"these books are awesome, why aren't you reading them\" tables. The cover drew me in and I realized I recognized the title. Plus I think it was some combination of books, prison, library and Boston that made me decide I need to read this.<br /><br />This is a memoir of Avi Steinberg, former yeshiva student and recent Harvard grad, looking for something to do that will get him dental insurance. He sees a job opening for a librarian and writing teacher at a Boston prison and decides to go for it. His stories of dealing with the various prison characters are hilarious and heartbreaking and sometimes terrifying, like when he gets mugged by a former library patron who makes off with his wallet and tells him he still has 2 books out.<br /><br />My worry with a memoir is that the story will be a series of of events that may not add up to a whole. I was very happy that this doesn't fall into that trap. The book is still a series of events but they add up to something. It doesn't feel like Avi is just sharing diary entries with what happened each day. He talks about trying to gain respect and maintain control in the library, dealing with the \"kites\" the prisoners send (letters left for prisoners in books), and trying to help the prisoners when he can.<br /><br />One of my favorite stories from the book is about Avi helping an incarcerated pimp named C.C. Too Sweet write his own memoirs. Avi is moved by his stories about his childhood and is pulled into Too Sweet's insistence that pimping is an art form. Avi had even convinced Too Sweet to expand the stories of the women Too Sweet worked with, to make them people instead of characters. But he's removed from the reality of what Too Sweet actually does until one day he sees a former prisoner and current pimp out in the real world. It's easy to be pulled into Too Sweet's stories without really comprehending exactly what it means to be a pimp and this reality is brought to the forefront for both Avi and the reader.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It's great for book lovers because there is a lot about the power of books, the importance of books and the beauty of books. It's not just about the books though, it's about the outcasts that populate the prison and what they're looking for when they go to the library.<br /><br />Update! There is a very high chance I first heard about this book from Lisa at <a href=\"http://bibliophiliac-bibliophiliac.blogspot.com/2010/12/review-running-books.html\">bibliophiliac</a> and I want to give credit.

Actually it's a little after literary blog hop time but whatever. Better late than never.<br /><br />This week's question: Do you like to supplement your reading with outside sources like Sparknotes, academic articles or other bloggers' reviews? Why or why not?<br /><br />Do I like to do this? Yes. Do I do it often? Not really.<br /><br />If the story is a classic, I like reading Sparknotes along with the reading to see if they bring up something I missed. I'd read academic articles if there was an easy way to find them and I'm happy to read them when I come across them. A number of my Shakespeare books are academic articles. I like reading about what people think about something I've recently read. It's like having a discussion, except the author doesn't take into account a thing that I say. The jerk.<br /><br />Ultimately though, I don't do this often. Because I'm lazy.<br /><br />Bloggers' reviews are in their own category. Most often I'll read a blogger's review if I've already read the book myself. Then it's back to that discussing a book together thing. If someone writes about a book I really want to read, or it's a blogger I read on a regular basis, I'm more likely to read a review of something I haven't yet read. When I'm actually writing my own reviews I try to stay away from what other people say. I don't want to repeat what everyone else had already said and I don't want my own opinion to be swayed by what someone else said.<br /><br />What about you?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:16+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:16+00:00","published_at":"2012-01-09T14:01:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e4c5dde22fdcf000508","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e4c5dde223867000296","title":"Blessed are the minimarshmallows","slug":"blessed-are-the-minimarshmallows","url":"/articles/blessed-are-the-minimarshmallows","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Stupidest+Angel+cover.jpg\" />I'm getting into the spiritg for this post about Christopher Moore's Christmas tale The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror. I'm watching my new DVD copy of A Muppet Christmas Carol which just came in the mail. I used to watch this movie every holiday but I only owned a VHS copy and while I do still own a VCR, it's currently being used as a mirror stand. So I know the holidays are done and whatnot but here's one more for you.<br /><br />I wasn't going to read any more Moore in 2011. I had already read 5 of his books this past year alone. But then HarperCollins put this ebook on sale along with a preview of his upcoming book Sacre Bleu and how could I turn that down?<br /><br />The Stupidest Angel takes place back in Pine Cove, the same location for <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/are-you-sayingthat-human-race-was\">Practical Demonkeeping</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/pine-cove-was-decorative-townonly-one\">The Lust-Lizard of Melancholy Cove</a>. There are a lot of characters from these two works, as well as Tucker Case and his fruit bat Roberto from The Island of the Sequined Love Nun and the titular stupidest angel Raziel from my favoritest Moore book Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. Seeing familiar faces was probably my favorite part of the book. Which is too bad because I wish it had been the story.<br /><br />It's a typical Moore story with typical Moore humor: irreverent, dark(ish) and absurd. I mean, zombies make an appearance so I think that pretty much covers all of those adjectives. It's funny and I found myself chuckling a number of times. But ultimately, the story didn't have the same heart as some of Moore's better books (Lamb, Fool, A Dirty Job). There's a lot going on, and you never feel like you get into the meat of any of the story lines. Plus Raziel has a much smaller part than I assumed, although in his short time he manages to cause a lot of chaos. I had more fun watching him in Lamb where he spent most of the story sitting in a hotel room watching WWE.<br /><br />A lot of my complaints with the novel are that I know Moore can do better. Hell, I see him do better here, in the bonus chapters from Sacre Bleu. They are excellent. The Stupidest Angel is still funny, still Moore, and I'm still glad I read it, but this won't be one I regularly re-read. I do want to share one quote, too long for the title, that I enjoyed, to end this on a happier note<br /><blockquote>\"Christmas Amnesty. You can fall out of contact with a friend, fail to return calls, ignore e-mails, avoid eye contact at the Thrifty-Mart, forget birthdays, anniversaries, and reunions, and if you show up at their house during the holidays (with a gift) they are socially bound to forgive you - act like nothing happened. Decorum dictates that the friendship move forward from that point, without guilt or recrimination.\"</blockquote>This is actually just the excuse I'm using. I got super excited when the Muppet movie came and wanted to watch it right away. Then I realized I should probably write a review instead of continuing to let them back up. And when I checked which one is next I saw it was this Christmas one. So everything is coming up Milhouse.<br /><br />The best version of A Christmas Carol. Don't bother trying to convince me otherwise. And it's surprisingly faithful to the Dickens original. You know, when you look past the frogs and pigs and whatnot.<br /><br />Title quote from location 2802<br /><br />Moore, Christopher. The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror.

Obviously, I'd heard a lot about the book. It keeps showing up on 2011 wrap up lists for top books, or at least most anticipated. So winning a copy was pretty sweet.<br /><br />The story isn't something I would normally think of as a King book. It's not a horror story. It has the supernatural elements that King is comfortable with, in this case time travel, and it's maybe a thriller but certainly not horror. Our main character, Jake Epping finds a way to travel back in time. Or rather Al, a friend of his that runs the local diner, finds a way. There's a passage in the pantry that brings you out a town in Maine (of course) on Tuesday, September 9, 1958. You can spend as much time as you'd like in the Land of Ago but only 2 minutes will have passed in the present. And each trip back in time is a reset.<br /><br />Al has a proposition for Jake: go back in time and prevent the JFK assassination before the diner is torn down at the path to the past is lost. If things go wrong, if the future is worse off, you can just go back through the pantry and do a reset. There's no risk. Now of course, the assassination doesn't happen until November 22nd, 1963 so Jake will have some time to kill. He has to make sure Oswald acted alone, that he wasn't just a patsy and that there isn't another shooter on the grassy knoll. And of course the past is obdurate; it doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />The story is a thriller in the will he/won't he and if he does, what's that mean for the future way. And there are moments where you're on the edge of your seat, but that's not the majority. A large chunk of the book is about Jake waiting to make his move. He has to learn as much as he can about Oswald to make sure he did act alone but he also just has a lot of time. So he takes on a teaching job, he makes friends, he starts to think maybe the present (or at this point Land of Ahead) is nice and all but maybe he should stay in the Land of Ago. It may seem like these are tangents off the main plot, but it's difficult to make that argument when they make up such a large portion of the book. You almost think it's the Oswald stuff that's interrupting the real story. The scenes of Jake in Jodie, Texas were some of my favorites.<br /><br />I said this isn't a horror story, but this is absolutely a King story. It feels like his writing and there are disgusting, graphic, grotesque scenes. It may not be horror but there are a few moments of intense violence. I don't want to scare people away but you should at least know what you're getting into.<br /><br />This is a big book (690 pages according to my ecopy, 849 pages in the hard back copy according to Amazon) and no one will accuse King of being a man of few words, but it reads quickly. One of my complaints is that I actually wanted it to be longer. The ending felt rushed and I wanted the pace slowed down to match the rest, so I felt like I was really getting the whole story.<br /><br />The rushed ending isn't the only thing I had trouble with. As much as I really liked this, the scenes of Jake in Jodie are almost too perfect. He's instantly a loved and respected teacher among both the students and the faculty. He can instantly bring out the best in students. Now I didn't notice any of these issues while I was reading, it was only after I finished the book and I started thinking about it. (Of course it's been suggested this is on purpose and all part of the past not wanting changed, and I hope so because I like that better than King just gave him some Mary-Sue like qualities.)<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book. And I REALLY wanted people to talk to about the book while I was reading it. So if everyone could just read this book so we can all talk about it, that would be super.<br /><br />Title quote from page 209<br /><br />King, Stephen. 11/22/63: A Novel.

Most bloggers have been filling out a survey of the best book you read in 2011, the worst book, most often recommended book, etc. I want to fill one of those out (I love surveys and talking about myself) but I know I'd never be able to think of answers to these. I'm sure I'd forget most of the books I read and all of my answers would be books I've read in the last couple months. But I still want to play along with some sort of wrap up, so here are my reading stats for the year.<br /><br />Number of books read<br />59!<br /><br />Number of pages read<br />18,254<br /><br />Percentage of fiction<br />66%<br /><br />Percentage of female authors<br />34%<br /><br />Percentage of white authors<br />81%<br /><br />Percentage of US authors<br />77%<br /><br />Percentage of ebooks<br />39%<br /><br />Percentage of re-reads<br />22%<br /><br />Books written by decade<br />1810s - 2%<br />1840s - 2%<br />1880s - 2%<br />1950s - 3%<br />1960s - 2%<br />1970s - 3%<br />1980s - 7%<br />1990s - 20%<br />2000s - 38%<br />2010s - 22%<br /><br />There are a few surprises for me. I didn't realize I'd read so many books/pages. Go me! I'm also surprised fiction is as low as it is. Then there are the things that didn't surprise me, like how many books are younger than me (thanks <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Brenna </a>for the idea for that measurement!). I'm hoping the classics challenge will help with that.<br /><br />I'd make some goals for myself, but that seems to be a set up for failure.

I love fairy tales, be it a straightforward collection of them, an annotated collection of them, a series of essays about what they mean and even a couple fairy tale re-tellings. So when I read Sexton's poem \"Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty)\" in a college writing class, I was hooked. I had to read more. And when I found out that there's a forward by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. well, that just sealed the deal.<br /><br />Now I'm not the biggest poetry fan. I would like to be, but I have a hard time reading poetry. Especially outside of a classroom where someone walks me through it. It seems when I study poetry, I find lots to love. When I try to just read a book of poetry myself I get distracted. Not that it's difficult to distract me, but still. Stories can hold my attention in a way that poetry just cannot. I still can't focus on these poems like I can with a traditional story, but the fact that these start with the familiar (a fairy tale) it means that it's easier for me to follow.<br /><br />Some of the poems are close to a straight re-telling of the tale (like \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\") with some added humor (\"The stepmother had a mirror to which she referred --/something like the weather forecast\") or some commentary (\"Snow White, the dumb bunny\"). Other poems (\"Rapunzel\") shine a new light on the story (\"A woman/who loves a woman/is forever young\"). And then some of the poems (\"Briar Rose\") bring out a more disturbing subtext (\"He [the prince] kissed Briar Rose/and she woke up crying:/ Daddy! Daddy!\")<br /><br />This is one of the only collection of poems I've completedg because it's short (only 112 pages, plus illustrations!) and because it's familiar. The poems are funny and though-provoking. These are not necessarily my favorite poems. They don't have a lyrical quality to them and I don't find myself reciting them, like I would a song that's stuck in my head. But the fact that they're about fairy tales really makes up for that.<br /><br />Other than Shakespeare's sonnets. Technically I read all of them for a class but, I know there were big sections that my eyes passed over, and I can't recall for the life of me. Appreciating poetry because I read it for a class is lost a bit when I have to read ALL the poetry at once. Besides those 2 I have other poetry books that I've read some (or even many) of the poems in, but never all of them.<br /><br />Title quote from page 2<br /><br />Sexton, Anne. Transformations.

I blame the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/readathon-time\">readathon </a>(which was awesome but gave me extra books to review) as well as Christmas for getting in the way. Not in a bad way because I heart Xmas but the whole family time thing really cuts into my computer time. So with my typical list of excuses, onto a review.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Color+Purple+cover.jpg\" />I first read The Color Purple by Alice Walker back in college, for one of those survey of American Lit classes. I read it and Beloved back to back and I always think of this as the easy book, when compared to Morrison's masterpiece. And relative to Beloved this is an easy book, at least in terms of readability and linear story telling. In terms of content however, The Color Purple deals with many difficult topics. The book starts with the main character, Celie, being repeatedly raped AND having her kids (with an \"s\", multiple) taken away from her. And she's only 14. So as you can tell, this is a barrel of laughs, some good light reading for the readathon.<br /><br />This is a heart-breaking story as Celie writes letters, first to God then later her sister Nettie.. She goes from an abusive home life to an abusive arranged marriage. Her husband Mr.____ didn't actually want her, he wanted her sister Nettie but Celie's step-father refused to agree to that arrangement and so he settled for Celie. Life just seems to be getting worse and worse for Celie as Mr.____'s children are cruel to her and Mr.____ treats her as an object, regularly beating and talking down to her. But there is a ray of hope in a \"woman of lose morals\" Shug Avery.<br /><br />Shug is the first person who seems to actually see Celie, who acts like a mother and friend to Celie. Shug is the person who encourages Celie to break her silence and to stand up for herself. Celie also gets a strong female role model, albeit in a more indirect way, in the form of Mr.___'s daughter-in-law, Sofia. Sofia is strong-willed, never allowing Mr.___'s son Harpo to treat her the way Mr.___ treats Celie. It's really because of her strength that some of the most tragic scenes dealt with her.<br /><br />There's some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect\">eye dialect</a>, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/literary-pet-peeves\">which I normally hate</a>, but it's done well. And by \"done well\", I mean done sparingly so I don't have to read it out loud in order to understand what's going on and feel like an awful racist person. It's perhaps not the best choice to read all in one sitting, but overall it's a beautiful and tragic and uplifting story.<br /><br />Title quote from page 169<br /><br />Walker, Alice.

Big plans I say. Then I got distracted by things like Christmas shopping and college basketball games (which I don't especially care about but nontheless attend because I'm a good girlfriend and also we went to a bar afterwards so win) and eating way too much food and seeing the Jesse Eisenberg play Asuncion because I have a real case of geek love. What I'm saying is, no reviews were written.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Dr+Jekyll+%2526+Mr+Hyde+cover.jpg\" />Back on December 3rd I took part in a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/readathon-time\">last minute readathon</a> and I've decided to be all ambitious and write up separate reviews for each of the books I read that day. There's only 3 of them so this shouldn't take me too long but that would assume less procrastination on my part. So I'm just now getting to the first review, that of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.<br /><br />I've had this book forever and I've never read it. I assume it was on a sales table (that's how I make my impulse buys) and I figured this was something I would like and then I never read it. Whoops. It's always in interesting experience, to read a book with a story you know so well. And this isn't like Frankenstein, where the movie has created a Frankenstein character so different from the literary original. Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde is pretty much the story you're already familiar with: a doctor (Jekyll) has found a way to separate out all of his evil and dark impulses into a different creation (Mr. Hyde). Here's the problem with a story that's so well know. That whole Jekyll and Hyde are actually the same person thing is the twist. Kinda messes with the story build up when you already know the twist. Especially if you don't know going into the story that that's the twist.<br /><br />So knowing that little twist does take something away from the original story, but there's plenty to keep it interesting. Once you get into the swing of the language, it's a creepy story. In what I assume is a Victorian thing (but really I have no idea), the story is told from an outsider's point of view. Here it's Dr. Jekyll's friend and lawyer Gabriel Utterson who hears about Hyde causing some mayhem and then paying for the expenses with a check from Jekyll. Curious, he starts investigating the connection between the two men, and you the reader could investigate this with him except for the whole knowing they're the same guy thing. Given I already knew this, I would have preferred the story to be from Jekyll's/Hyde's POV. Hard to fault Stevenson for this of course but still. It just means the story doesn't stand up quite as well as Dracula or Frankenstein.<br /><br />There are \"other stories\" included in my book but I didn't read them because I wanted to move on during the readathon. Maybe some day. Given my past track record with the book, I'd say it'll be another 10 or so years.

Both Brenna at <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2011/05/how-i-became-famous-novelist-by-steve.html\">Literary Musings</a> and Greg at <a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/2011/06/how-i-became-famous-novelist-literary.html\">The New Dork Review</a> talked about the awesomeness of this book, but I just put off reading it. I don't know why. It's not an intimidating book. It's not a particularly difficult book. It is funny and snarky and cynical and exactly the type of book I usually jump at. I assume I was just being stubborn. Needless to say, I'm very happy I finally picked up How I Became a Famous Novelist by Steve Hely.<br /><br />After finishing up Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil over Thanksgiving I knew I'd need another book for my flights home and this seemed like the perfect time to quit procrastinating. This was the perfect airplane read, except for the whole laughing-out-loud part. Pete Tarslaw just wants to make a lot of money and impress his ex-girlfriend at her wedding and after watching an interview with a NYTimes best-selling author realizes the whole writing thing is a con game and he wants in. He goes through checklists of rules (Rule 9: At dull points include descriptions of delicious meals) or details to include (Woman who says stuff that turns out to have extra meaning when it's revealed she's in a wheelchair). He comes up with every cliche from literary bestsellers and throws them all into his book.<br /><br />Surprisingly (or not, if you just look at the title of the book) his con works and he does become a famous novelist. Sure, it's panned by critics (he has some funny moments bitching about book reviewers, especially book bloggers) but it's loved by his readers. That isn't what's important though. The money and the whole rubbing his good fortune in his ex's face are the driving forces here. He's quite the noble character.<br /><br />The NYTimes best seller list doesn't contain any actual authors, but it's not a far stretch to see who he's really referring to. Hely shines when he's describing Pete's writing or when he's mocking these authors. Once he reaches success the book is still funny but I laughed aloud less often. There are parts that are downright painful to read. The wedding scene was particularly wonderful, even if I tried to read it between my fingers.<br /><br />This is a hilarious and quick read. And if you have any sort of interest in the publishing world, you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />Update: Alice at <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2011/08/top-10-underrated-books-according-to.html\">Reading Rambo</a> also recommended this to me and I want to make it clear I ignored all of them equally.<br /><br />Title quote from page 47, location 376<br /><br />Hely, Steve.

I didn't know much about the book other than 1) it takes place in Savannah, 2) there was a murder, 3) it is a true story, 4) my dad really liked the book and he has pretty good taste. I assumed this was sort of a horror story, like In Cold Blood. I mean there's a murder. And just look at that title. And that cover. I even planned on reading it in October until I decided I had spent too much on books that month and put it off. I ended up reading it over Thanksgiving since I was at my dad's and he happens to have a copy. Like I said, he likes the book. He even has a statue similar to the one on the cover.<br /><br />As I said, I thought this was a horror story or at least a thriller. Imagine my surprise when I was totally wrong about that. This is not a horror story. It's a travelogue that focuses more on the characters John Berendt met during his time in Savannah than any particular museums or landmarks. And it's hilarious. That murder, the one that shows up at the start of every summary I've seen, shows up about half-way into the book. This isn't to say these summaries are misleading by describing this event since in actuality it is the only real action that happens. And I should say possible murder/possible self-defense. To summarize the rest of the book you get: \"John decided to move part time to Savannah and while there he meets a lot of people.\" Other than the killing, that's all that happens.<br /><br />The action isn't important though. It's the characters that I fell in love with. It's hard to believe this is nonfiction because the characters are so colorful. I love all of them. Of course there's Jim Williams, the antique dealer who lives in a glorious house and throws the Christmas party of the year. And Danny Hansford, a hot headed youth that has a strange run of the Williams home. A man that walks an invisible dog, a woman that sings all over the county and if she's ever caught driving drunk the cops are to immediately take her home (and are punished by superiors if they try to arrest her). But my favorite characters are the lovable con-man Joe, who makes constant comments to John about who will play him in the movie that will be made of the little book he's writing, and The Lady Chablis, a pre-op transsexual and drag performer who has my favorite scene at the local African-American debutante ball. I want to watch the movie now primarily because The Lady Chablis plays herself in the movie. (Please, if you've seen the movie, let me know if it's any good!)<br /><br />This was such a great book. I'm sad I waited so long to read it. I'm thinking I'm going to have to pick up my own copy of it eventually, because this is a book I'm going to want to read again and again.<br /><br />Title quote from page 230 (I think.

However, Thanksgiving gave me a chance to read a lot without getting much writing done. And then I participated in the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/readathon-time\">readathon last Saturday</a>, so I have a bit of a backlog of reviews to get through. On the one hand, the books now have a chance to simmer and any immediate reaction (what crap! OMG that was the best thing everrrrrr!) have passed and I can give a more mature and well-thought out review. On the other hand, mature and well-thought out reviews. Don't worry, I'll try to keep them as childish as possible.<br /><br />I've wanted to read Stephen King's On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft ever since I found out my favorite short story, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor\">1408, </a>was originally written as an example of how a story changes from one draft to another. I also happen to think that King is a better writer than he is normally given credit for so I liked the idea of seeing his thoughts on the process.<br /><br />This was a much better read than I thought it would be. Not that I went into it thinking it would be a drag (why would I have bothered with it if I thought that?) but it was surprisingly good. The first part is a memoir of King's life, told in 38 short events. King focuses on the events that he believes shaped him as a writer: his many rejections (and eventual acceptances) to literary magazines, his time moving around while his mother looked for work, his time working at an industrial laundry mat and then as a professor, to the point that he's at now. Or at least where he was at when he wrote this.<br /><br />But the focus isn't on King's life, it's on writing. One thing you learn for sure from this, if you learn nothing else, is that King loves writing. He clearly was doing it for many years before it was making him money. He never makes the claim that if you follow steps A, B and C, you're going to become a FAMOUS NOVELISTg. He just says \"Here's what I do. I believe these things are going to help you at least be a competent writer.\" There's no magic here. It's just advice that seems kind of obvious once he tells you. He talks about \"the toolbox\". The things that you need to write: vocabulary, grammar (don't worry about grammar lessons, you just need to be able to write legibly), form and style the basic stuff. He especially hates adverbs and the passive voice, which again is nothing new, but I like hearing his diatribe against them. Especially because I know I'm guilty of both.<br /><br />I especially liked the comparison between a first draft and a second draft of a story, in this case the story that eventually became 1408. He ends up going through most of the things he talks about in the rest of the book, but you can see it in a real-life scenario.<br /><br />I can see myself re-reading this a lot. Or even just references bits and pieces of it, whether I start writing or not.<br /><br />Those steps will come from another book I read and need to write a review for, How I Became A Famous Novelist. And by the way, some of the tips from here are mentioned in Hely's book. It was funny to finish this book just to see the stuff mentioned elsewhere. Even if it is sarcastically.<br /><br />Title quote from page 114<br /><br />King, Stephen. On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.

I don't even know who I am anymore. But last readathon everyone seemed to be having such a good time and I wanted in on the fun. So here we go<br /><br /><a href=\"http://deadwhiteguyslit.blogspot.com/2011/12/tonight-we-dine-in-readathon.html\">Amanda from Dead White Guys</a> is hosting this readerly shindig, so thank you! I have a very tentative list for the day. I pretty much went around and pulled books off of my bookshelves that were short and I hadn't read them before or at least not in awhile. I also won a copy of King's new book 11/22/63 from Audra at <a href=\"http://unabridged-expression.blogspot.com/\">Unabridged Chick</a> which is super awesome except for one tiny detail. It's an ecopy that works in pretty much every ereader except the Kindle. It's a hipster copy (Kindle's too mainstream) so I'll have to read it on my computer. But spending too much time staring at a computer makes my eyes angry so I'll just start 11/22/63 before moving onto the other books.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Readathon-12.11-stack.jpg\" />One other quick note. In case you haven't followed my whining on Twitter, I'm sick so much of this reading and posting is going to be under the influence of cold medicine. Keep that in mind when I start to ramble more than normal.<br /><br />Update 1: I figure I'll keep all of the updates in a single post, for reasons that made a lot of sense to me when I made that decision, but which I've forgotten now.<br /><br />I ended up spending almost 30 min looking for the file for the King book, because I'm super organized like that. I was just about to give up when the file turned up. So that's fun. I've got about 77 pages read and I'm going to stick with King, at least until I finished Part 1: Watershed Moment. But first I need some coffee.<br /><br />Update 2: It's 11:20ish and I have been coffee'd. Also Cheerio'd. I'm low on interesting snacks because I failed to do any prep for this readathon whatsoever. The rest of you should have super delicious snacks, so I can live vicariously through you. Also so I can stock up for next time. Also I finished up Part 1 of 11/22/63 and I've moved onto Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because I've been toting this book around since at least high school and I should probably read it so I look less like a phony.<br /><br />Update 3: It's 12:40 and now it's time for a reading break so I can have some lunch. I'm having another China bowl (leftover Chinese food all mixed together). Also I just finished up Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde so I am le winner. Now I have to decide what to read next.<br /><br />Update 4: 3:44. China bowl was delicious. I'm thinking I should probably put some real clothes on at some point and now seems as good a time as any. I ended up going back to 11/22/63 and reading Part 2: The Janitor's Father. Now I can't decide if I should read 1984 or The Color Purple.<br /><br />Update 5: 6:30. Damn, time flies. I decided that now that I'm feeling marginally human again, I should wear real clothes. You know, since I didn't bother with them yesterday. I decided to go with The Color Purple because it is 16 pages shorter. That's how you make readathon selections, right? I made some hot cocoa but I'm out of milk, so I supplemented by added extra marshmallows.<br /><br />Update 6: 9:35 and I finished another book! I am super winner! Granted, I've already read The Color Purple before, but that doesn't taint the win. I'm running out snacks and I'm now up to the 4th Indian Jones movie (by the way, I've had the Indian Jones movies on in the background cos they're on TV and I can't turn them down) so this means I might almost be done with the reading. Maybe one more quick read but then I'm done.<br /><br />Update 7: 10:51 and I'm done. I ended with Transformations by Anne Sexton, which is a collection of poems about fairy tales. It's not super long and there are pictures. And an introduction by Vonnegut, so a good time all around.<br /><br />Books Reads<br />Parts 1 &amp; 2 from 11/22/63 by Stephen King<br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson<br />The Color Purple by Alice Walker<br />Transformations by Anne Sexton<br />Total pages<br />648<br /><br />Good luck to everyone else continuing on with the reading.

This month's question:<br />What work of literature would you recommend to someone who doesn't like like literature?<br /><br /> I want to focus my answer on those who like to read but just avoid \"literature\". Cos people who just say they don't like to read at all, well that's a different battle.g I think the problem people actually have isn't with \"literature\" but with bad memories of high school English reading lists. I was lucky that I had some great English teachers growing up and they certainly can take credit for my love of reading. They might like to read but they've been turned off of lit.<br /><br />In this case, I'm talking about my mom. She's a voracious reader and always has been, but for the most part she stays away from lit. She's often told me how much she disliked her English classes in high school. The teachers would say: \"This is what you were supposed to take from that reading, and if you thought of anything else, you're wrong.\" I know one of her favorite reads was David Copperfield (she used to recite the opening lines) but that's pretty much the start and end of her lit reading. <br /><br />She got a Kindle about a year ago and I convinced her to read Pride and Prejudice because, hey, free. And you know what? She liked it. Now a big help here was she was already familiar with the story but she liked it. Heads up mom, I might start downloading some other (free) classics to your Kindle for you. <br /><br />It's difficult to say \"this is something non-literary readers should read\" because people are different and some literary books are going to be a homerun for some people and a foul for others. For example, Slaughterhouse Five is, in general, a book I would recommend to the non-literary to read. However, I can't imagine that would have been a popular choice for my mom. It's not her style.<br /><br />That said, here are some literary reads that will probably work for even the \"lit is scary\" readers. I don't know that this is going to be a super original list, but sometimes the standards are standards for a reason:<br />Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<br />Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut<br />The Great Gatsby by F.

Hell, I'm introduced to genres I normally wouldn't check out. In this case the book is Beat to a Pulp: Hardboiled, which is a collection of hardboiled short stories. The book was brought to my attention by Ben at <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> who wrote one of the stories in the collection.<br /><br />Short story collections are always a challenge to review. Do you talk about every story? Just a few? The collection overall? I can never decide which way to go so I've decided I'm just going to babble instead of going into this with any sort of structure. You know, my usual method.<br /><br />First up, this was a quick read. And not a quick as in \"this was an easy read that required no thought\". It was quick because I kept wanting to see what happened next. And then that story would end and I'd go \"Well I just have time for one more...\" I have a very short attention span so normally with short stories I read one then put the book down and wander away. Not this time though. Even the stories that weren't my favorite still made me want to read more. That was pretty sweet.<br /><br />Short stories can be tricky. They need to tell a complete story, a complete arc, in the span of just a few pages. They can be a moment of part of a larger story (aren't all stories?) but it needs to be fully contained. Most of the stories in this collection succeeded but there were a couple that felt like they were chapters out of a larger novel. They told of a single event, but they didn't feel like a single story. Kent Gowran's \"A Small Thing at the Devil's Punchbowl\" and John Hornor Jacobs \"The Death Fantastique\" both had this problem. I liked both stories, I thought they were interesting and well-written, but they felt like I picked up a full novel and read a couple pages out of it. They didn't work as short stories.<br /><br />On the other hand, some of the stories were especially good, both in terms of working as a short story as well as just being a good read. My two favorites are \"Ric with No K\" by Patricia Abbot and Ben's \"Second Round Dive\".<br /><br />Before I say anything else, I want to say that when I first started Ben's story I told myself I wasn't going to review it. It can be nerve wracking to write any review, moreso when you know the author might read it and then that's tripled when the author is a blogging friend. So I was just going to avoid that whole deal by not writing about it. And then I ended up really liking the story. A story about a boxer. I don't like boxers or boxing or fighting, unless it involves Christian Bale acting like a crack head. But the fact is when the story is about the characters and is good, it doesn't matter what the details are. Plus this happens to be the only story that I stopped to highlight different partsg. So in the end, I couldn't help me say something about this story and I'm very happy that it is all good things.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised that my other favorite story of the collection is written by a female author. I didn't notice that until after I finished but it's nice to see ladies getting in on this genre. (They might be all over the genre, I really have no idea.) In this case there is little in terms of a plot, which was a change from so many of the other stories that were very plot driven. There is a plot there, but it mostly focuses on the main character, a naive young girl who sporadically sees her flaky mom in between foster homes and her criminal older \"boyfriend\" Ric. The story could have easily gone the route of a Law &amp; Order: SVU episode but by focusing on the girl, it doesn't. It takes on an innocence that makes it endearing as well as disturbing.<br /><br />As I've said, I'm not a hardboiled expert by any means, so I can't tell you if this collection is really indicative of the genre as a whole or what. I can't put it into a real context but I can tell you I really enjoyed this. It's a collection that kept me entertained and kept me going \"just one more story.\" <br /><br />This isn't entirely true, as I did highlight a line in another story. But that highlight was because I went \"what? That doesn't make sense at all.\" In \"The Death Fantastique\" a character wonders why the girl takes a shower but doesn't wash her hair and wonders what the point is. Then makes a comment about localized dirt between her legs. Really, my problem with this is I definitely don't wash my hair each time I shower because do you know how long it takes to wash and dry long hair? For me at least, while I have long hair, it's like an extra hour of work. It's a real pain in the ass. I know it's a stupid, little thing, but it took me out of the story.<br /><br />Title quote from location 53<br /><br />Crammer, David and Scott D. Parker (eds). Beat to a Pulp: Hardboiled.

At least those of you who are in the US. For my international readers, you should really get in on this holiday. Seriously, you hang out with family and think about what you're thankful for and most importantly PIE! It's pretty cool.<br /><br />I spent my Thanksgiving in South Carolina because screw cold weather. I'm currently pet-less and my dad has a bit of a menagerie (6 cats and 3 dogs at the start of the tripg) so that's always fun. Plus it distracts me from the fact that, with the exception of my phone, I'm internet-less down there. Oh they have internet, but they're so far out they can't get unlimited access (I didn't realize that was a problem for things that aren't wireless phones) and they work out of the home so they need their interwebs. Also I'm way too lazy to set up anything. This paragraph is just a big excuse as to why a) I haven't posted anything in awhile and b) why I haven't read any blogs in a week. But I have been reading! So to tempt you with stuff I will be reviewing once I get my shit together, here are the books I've read that I need to write about:<br /><br />Beat to a Pulp edited by Scott D.

See, most of the animals my dad gets are animals that wander over and don't leave. The house is an old plantation so it's in the middle of no where and there are stray animals roaming the area. There used to be a bunch of wildcats around, which was good because they took care of the mice and rats. That is until my dad got a couple dogs that just destroyed the cat population. If you're wondering what a dog would do if it ever caught the cat, kill it is the answer. So dad was feeding this a cat that started showing up, and one day noticed she looked a little larger than usual. And what do you know, she's pregnant. To keep the cat and her eventual kittens safe, they brought the cat inside. The cat is going the 16 and Pregnant route, but instead of time on an MTV show and a boob job, it gets to live inside and not get eaten by dogs. Clever girl. But 6 cats is a lot so they were going to give away all the kittens and managed 3 (2 to my step-mom's sister and one to a co-worker of hers). I'm trying to convince Boyfriend that we need one of these but so far he's resisting.

You know, so I could bolster those total pages read each month that no one but me cares about. But lucky for me, I had an unread Christopher Moore book sitting on my shelf.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Lust+Lizard+cover.jpg\" />The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove takes place in the same fictional town of Pine Cove that his first novel, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/are-you-sayingthat-human-race-was\">Practical Demonkeeping</a>, was set. And like PD, it also involves a supernatural monster, although this time it's the Sea Beast Steve instead of the supernatural demon Catch terrorizing the tiny resort town. On top of this there's a suspicious suicide, a ranch no one's allowed to step foot on and the local psychiatrist has just changed everyone's anti-depressants to placebos. Moore's skill is creating colorful characters and once again his cast is a lot of fun to watch. There's the pot-head constable Theo, the guilt ridden psychiatrist Val, the nerdy biologist Gabe (or Food Guy as he's known by his dog Skinner), the local crazy lady and ruined B-movie star Molly and of course the bartender of the local bar, who is now more machine than person (what with the replacement hips, pacemakers, etc), Mavis. How can you not want to read whatever they get into?<br /><br />I was surprised after I finished reading The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove to find out that this wasn't the second novel he wrote. It's not only that it has the same setting and several same characters as his first novel, but it feels like an early novel. The book is funny but it doesn't have the heart of some of his other novels, like Lamb or Fool. There is a lot going on and the different story-lines feel like they're rushed at the end. The book constantly jumps from one point of view to another, which I actually like, but it means that there is a lot going on and it's easy to lose focus. And because there are so many characters (I didn't even mention Estelle the artist or Catfish the blues singer. Except now I did.) no one gets the attention they deserve and they feel unfinished.<br /><br />It was still fun and certainly a quick read but I know he can do so much better. <br /><br />Title quote from page 129<br /><br />Moore, Christopher.

Maybe The Sound and the Fury, maybe some Hemingway. And I've never read any Steinbeck. Definitely a modernist.<br /><br />Reread a classic of your choice<br />Probably Slaughterhouse 5, for the same reason as Red, actually. I wonder if I still know how to spell Trafalmadorian. (Google says I misplaced the L. TraLfama...) Maybe Gatsby or On The Road.<br /><br />A Classic Play<br />If I'm still on the horror kick the rest of these items are for, I'll probably read Faust (Goethe)<br /><br />Classic Mystery/Horror/Crime Fiction<br />Never read any Lovecraft, so I'll throw in some of his stuff here. He counts as classic in my book, at least.<br /><br />Classic Romance<br />I dunno. I just read P&amp;P&amp;Z, and that was enough romance for me for a while. This says something about me. I'm not sure if it's flattering or not.<br /><br />Maybe Madame Bovary (Flaubert)?<br /><br />A Classic translated from its original language to your native language<br />Probably Inferno (Dante)<br /><br />Classic Award Winner<br />Well golly gee there's a lot of awards to choose from and a lot of books I haven't heard of. No clue. I want to sneak some Brit lit on here, so I guess I'll pull from the Man Booker? Possibly Midnight Children (Rushdie).<br /><br />Or, I might cave and finally read Gravity's Rainbow (Pynchon), since it's already on my Kindle and everything.<br /><br />Classic set in a country you (realistically speaking) will not visit during your lifetime<br />Thanks to Red, I've settled on, appropriately enough, \"My Name is Red\" (Orhan Pamuk). Takes place in 16th century Istanbul, which if I remember correctly, sets it concurrently with the American Revolution.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:23+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:23+00:00","published_at":"2011-11-17T13:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e535dde2238670002a5","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Paolo Redbeard","slug":"paolo-redbeard","url":"/articles/tags/paolo-redbeard"},{"value":"Back to the Classics","slug":"back-to-the-classics","url":"/articles/tags/back-to-the-classics"}]}]},{"id":"53224e535dde2264190005f1","title":"Is the unwillingness to pay more for food really a matter of affordability or priority?","slug":"is-the-unwillingness-to-pay-more-for-food-really-a-matter-of-affordability-or-priority","url":"/articles/is-the-unwillingness-to-pay-more-for-food-really-a-matter-of-affordability-or-priority","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Omnivores+Dilemma+cover.jpg\" />I love food. I love eating. I love cooking. After a vacation to Seattle which was filled with a lot of eating (including a food tour) I seriously considered moving out there, partly on the strength of the food. Hell, I'm still considering it cos I loved it out there and what, it's only ~3,000 miles from work, family and friends. But seriously, this <a href=\"http://www.paseoseattle.com/index.php/home.html\">Paseo </a>sandwich was really good.<br /><br />What I'm saying is, I'm a fan of food. So one day I was wandering a a bookstore and I noticed the book The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals by Michael Pollan and I was intrigued. I'd heard about the book and it was almost a book club selection one month, but I didn't really know much about it. I was hesitant because in general whenever there is a book about food it is so...judgey. Judgey and angry and hit-you-over-the-head with arguments about what you shouldn't and can't eat, lest you want everyone on the planet end up poisoned. I've read Fast Food Nation and I was worried this would be another \"if you eat X, you may as well a) rape mother nature if you eat food from a factory farm b) single-handedly destroy the nation's economy by only eating locally/organically\".g But I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Pollan's agenda for the book is just awareness. Be aware of where your food comes from. It seems simple and it's hard to argue that it's better to be ignorant of where you're getting something as fundamental as food. The \"omnivore's dilemma\" is that we can eat so many different things that it's not necessarily simple to know what to eat. To use his example, a koala eats eucalyptus. That is the end of the consideration a koala has to give to what it's going to eat. Are there eucalyptus leaves? Yes? Boom, dinner is figured out. Now the koala can get back to all the other stuff they do like sleeping and getting STDs. People can, and do, eat lots of different foods so the question becomes what to eat. Now we have a good idea what we can eat but the question is where is our food coming from. Pollan focuses on traditional and organic factory farms (which are surprisingly similar), a local \"grass-farm\" and then he actually goes the hunter/gatherer route and finds a meal himself.<br /><br />At no point does it ever feel like Pollan's hitting you over the head with an agenda. There are pros and cons to every method of getting your food and to claim that one way is perfect is ridiculous. Of course that also doesn't mean that industries couldn't use some revamping. You can understand that in a globalized and industrial world that completely getting rid of factory farms is unrealistic, but it's hard to say that feeding grains to animals that were never meant to live on it (and thus get sick and require lots of antibiotics) is a great system. Local farms certainly seem like the better choice, but could they really feed an entire nation?<br /><br />We'll see how much reading this changes my eating habits. I'm hoping it makes me a more informed eater. I'm hoping it will make me stop and consider where is my food coming from, where could it come from, what's a realistic choice for me and what's a good choice for me? Eating should be more than a refueling exercise and it's important enough to give it serious thought.<br /><br />FFN is in the first category, although I actually enjoyed it when I read it and I haven't had McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's type meal since then. Partially because of the book and partially because it's way healthier to just not eat it and it wasn't all that hard to cut out anyway.<br /><br /> Koalas, I thought you guys were just bundles of cute, but little did a know so many of you are also <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/207316/are-stds-killing-koala-bears\">riddled with chlamydia</a>. Awesome. This isn't in the book, just a little factoid for you. The more you know.<br /><br />Title quote from page 243/location 4007<br /><br />Pollan, Michael.

This week however, I got it covered. This week's top 10, hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/11/top-ten-unread-books-on-janas-bookshelf.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a> is the top 10 books that have been on my shelf for the longest time but I've never read. Oh, you mean books that are a sense of shame for me? Yup, I got this list...<br /><br />1. The Once and Future King by T.H. White - I took this book from my grandparent's years ago when they were looking to downsize their books. It looked interesting and since then I have carried it around with me from apartment to apartment and I've never read it.<br /><br />2. The War of the Worlds, The Time Machine and Selected Stories by H.G. Wells - Here's another book I took from my grandparent's library that I think I've had even longer than TOFK and I've still yet to read it. I'm hoping the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/back-to-classics-my-tentative-reading\">Back to the Classics challenge</a> will fix that.<br /><br />3. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein - Maybe there's something about authors that use initials but I've had this one since my dad bought it for me when I was, I think, in middle school and still nothing. This is also on my Classics challenge list so maybe I can fix this.<br /><br />4. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Lewis Stevenson - So many classics, so many good intentions. Now to just actually read them. This is also tentatively on my Classics challenge. It's one of the reasons I'm doing this challenge; I need to fix all of these books I keep dragging with me but I haven't read.<br /><br />5. The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen - I bought this a little over a year ago in an airport bookstore so I haven't had it with me all that long. However, it is a sense of shame because I started reading it on the plane (I'd run out of the books I brought with me) but then when I got home I put it down and haven't picked it up again.<br /><br />6. The Malcontents: The Best Bitter, Cynical and Satirical Writing in the World - A friend of mine in high school gave me this book because she said the title made her think of me. I am a ray of sunshine. It's a really great collection with some heavy names (Moliere, Cervantes, Shaw, Wilde) and while I've read some of the stuff in other settings, I've never read this book. Looking at this now I realize there are select works from Flann O'Brien, which makes me really want to read his stuff, since I used to go to a dive bar in college of the same name.<br /><br />7. The Spoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters - I may have taken this from my brother after he had to read it for a class. It sounded interesting but I got about a page into it before I got distracted by something else and I've yet to pick it up again.<br /><br />8. Nine Stories by J.D. Salinger - Another initial name! I've read Catcher but nothing else. Now technically this is one of boyfriend's books which I'm sure he has read but it's been sitting on our bookshelves for the last 4 years and I haven't read it yet so it counts.<br /><br />9. Lying, Cheating &amp; Stealing: Great Writers on Getting What You Want When You Want It - I found this on some discount table at a bookstore years ago and loved the writers included in it (Dorothy Parker, ee cummings, Dashiell Hammett, Mark Twain) but I've never made it further than the first short story by Woody Allen. Why haven't I been reading this?<br /><br />10. All The World's A Grave by John Reed, adapted from the works of William Shakespeare - When I saw this book that says \"A New Play by William Shakespeare\" how could I not pick it up? It's the characters and the text from Shakespeare rearranged to form a new play. But it's intimidating. At least with Shakespeare-Shakespeare I can read a summary of the story or watch the play, so it's easy to follow along. I can't do that with this Shakespeare-Reed. I've given the play a few tries but I've always backed down.<br /><br />So what have you had on your TBR pile for years?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:24+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:24+00:00","published_at":"2011-11-15T13:31:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e545dde2264190005f4","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e545dde2264190005f5","title":"The plague had a knack for narrative closure","slug":"the-plague-had-a-knack-for-narrative-closure","url":"/articles/the-plague-had-a-knack-for-narrative-closure","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Zone+One+cover.jpg\" />I can't quite remember who I first heard about Colson Whitehead's Zone One from but I remember hearing the description \"literary zombie novel\" and I thought Sold! I actually even recommended the book before I read it (before it was out to the general public) to a friend of mine on that basis alone. Needless to say, I was excited so as soon as the book was available I downloaded it.g<br /><br />I said in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/back-to-classics-my-tentative-reading\">my last post </a>I was procrastinating on getting this review written that's only mostly true. I had an episode of The Walking Dead sitting on the DVR so consider my decision to watch that instead of writing this research. But there's also the fact that Zone One lends itself to letting the book percolate for a couple days after you've finished it. The book is called a literary zombie novel and sure, it's technically a zombie novel, but that makes up such a small part of the story. It's really ruminations on things that have been lost in the new apocalyptic world.<br /><br />This is a slow, meandering story as the main character Mark Spitz performs skel and straggler cleanup duty with the Omega team, as they try to make lower Manhattan habitable for people again. I kept forgetting that the story only takes place over 3 days. There are flashbacks and memories that made me feel like I'd spent years with the characters. Even the post-apocalyptic stress disorder (PASD) that almost every character suffers from in some way or another is pronounced \"past.\" The constant flashbacks and side stories made it difficult to follow at times and I found myself re-reading sections going \"Wait, where are we? Is a zombie still trying to eat his face? Cos that's where I think we left off before he noticed that the skel kinda looked like his 3rd grade math teacher and we were off on that tangent. Oh yes, now that I've turned back 40 pages, a zombie is currently (literally) trying to eat his face.\" This was frustrating at first because even though I heard that \"literary\" designation I was still expecting a typical zombie apocalypse novel, along the lines of World War Z. Once I got over the pacing and just let the prose wash over me, I was happy.<br /><br />The prose. The prose is what makes this novel. I'm so happy I read this on my Kindle because I felt like I marked down a paragraph or phrase on every page. The book has so many moments moments of comedy and poignancy and tragedy. Here are just a couple of the many (many) lines that I highlighted.<br /><blockquote>\"Rumor was they had two of the last Nobel laureates working on things up there -- useful ones, none of that Peace Prize or Literature stuff\" (page 35)</blockquote><blockquote>\"He stopped hooking up with other people once he realized the first thing he did was calculate whether or not he could outrun them.\" (page 115)</blockquote><blockquote>\"Hope is a gateway drug, don't do it.\" (page 179)</blockquote><blockquote>\"Would the old bigotries be reborn as well, when they cleared out this Zone, and the next, and so on, and they were packed together again, tight and suffocating on top of each other? Or was that particular bramble of animosities, fears, and envies impossible to recreated? If they could bring back paperwork, Mark Spitz thought, they could certainly reanimate prejudice, parking tickets and reruns.\" (page 231)</blockquote>The one thing about this book is I can't see myself re-reading it, at least not right away. I re-read a lot and usually when I really love a book, I want to re-visit it again. And while I can't say I'll never read this again, I can't see myself coming back to it anytime soon. I came, I saw, I enjoyed, I'm good. For awhile anyway.<br /><br />I hate hardback books but I'm also impatient so the Kindle has been especially helpful.<br /> No really. I'm looking at my notes and I have stuff on page 142, 149, 150, 151, 158. I highlight ALL THE THINGS.<br /><br />Title quote from page 130/location 2013<br /><br />Whitehead, Colson.

But luckily the hop is the 3-6, so technically I didn't miss it. I'm just fashionably late.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LiteraryBlogHop-1.jpg\" /><br />Anyway the question is (or technically questions are): To what extent do you analyze literature? Are you more analytical in your reading if you know you're going to review the book? Is analysis useful in helping you understand and appreciate literature, or does it detract from your readerly experience?<br /><br />To what extent do I analyze lit? Not as much as I'd like to. Or rather, I wish my analysis was better. My degree is in English Lit, so I can't help but analyze the stuff I read now. But even while I was in school I remember I'd hear someone's insight about a book or a character or a scene and I'd think to myself \"Yes! That is so obvious how did I miss it\" and then I can never read the book again without hearing that analysis. Maybe there's something about the confidence in the other person's assertion. I might look at a scene and pick it apart, but I'm never sure if I have completely missed something or not. So I guess I miss other people's analysis and the whole classroom discussion thing.<br /><br />Are you more analytical in your reading if you know you're going to review the book? Since I started this blog I've reviewed every book I've read so at this point how much I analyze a book has nothing to do with if I'm going to review it. I know I'm going to. As to how much analysis do I put into a review, that really depends on the book and the review I plan on writing. In general, if I'm just reviewing a book, I won't go into an analysis of it. I did more analysis earlier in my blog when I would write multiple posts on a single book. Because I've been writing more straight reviews, I write less analysis so I probably read with a less analytical mindset. I'd like to get back into writing these types of posts but they tend to take me much longer to write. I'll start off a post making one point and then half way through writing I'll realize I actually think the opposite is now the case, and I have to rewrite it. Repeat 3 more times.<br /><br />Is analysis useful in helping you understand and appreciate literature, or does it detract from your readerly experience? It is helpful when understanding and appreciate lit that has something there to analyze. And I guess that is assume with the term \"literature\" instead of just general books. There are some books that just don't have much there to analyze. And that's fine. Sometime a simple, transparent story is what I want and trying to analyze something that doesn't have the depth for analysis is going to detract from the experience. However if it is a real piece of literature than I think analyzing can help you understand it better and from different points of view.<br /><br />So what do you think? Are you an analyzer?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:25+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:25+00:00","published_at":"2011-11-04T13:11:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e555dde2238670002a9","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e565dde22fdcf000511","title":"October Reading Wrap-Up","slug":"october-reading-wrap-up-2","url":"/articles/october-reading-wrap-up-2","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/october-calendar.jpg\" />I know I'm a little late with this.

See I was going to write this yesterday and instead of doing that I watched the latest episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia that was sitting on the DVR.

I don't know where the time is going, but I'm clearly not paying enough attention. Maybe I'll participate in a read-a-thon at some point so I can do a little better with the whole reading thing.<br /><br />For my author stats I was going to look at each of the short stories authors in Horrorscape separately.

Also I'm going to blame this on the recent snowstorm that hit the Northeast, even though that happened way after I finished reading Horrorscape. But seriously, we got a foot and a half in Jersey and it wasn't even Halloween yet, so I think that excuse can work retroactively.<br /><br />Since I have been lazy getting these posts written I figure I'll just combine the last two sections of Horrorscapes together in this single entry, and instead of reviewing a couple stories, like I did in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/there-is-no-delight-equal-of-dread\">my last post</a>, I'll give you a quick comment about each of them.<br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>Part 3: Belief and The Supernatural</span><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Pickman%2527s-Model-cover.jpg\" />Pickman's Model by H.P. Lovecraft - This is the first Lovecraft I'd read and it is what makes me want to read more of the guy. Plus it takes place in Boston's North End, which I lived in for awhile, and could totally believe that evil things are crawling around just below the city.<br />The Roaches by Thomas Disch - A good though somewhat forgettable creepy crawly horror story and what happens when someone is a lonely clean freak.<br />The Boogeyman by Stephen King - You can always tell a King story without even knowing he wrote it. He has a certain tone and no matter how crazy things get the characters sound real and flawed. It's fun to see him take on the creature that hides in children's closets.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/homer_jackinthebox.gif\" />It's a Good Life by Jerome Bixby - You (probably) know this one, even if you don't know you know it. Twilight Zone and Simpsons did it. Little kid can read thoughts and control things with his mind and hates when people are unhappy or think bad things. What happens when someone with a 5 year old understanding of morality has complete control over everyone? It just confirms that kids are terrifying.<br /><span>Part 4: Avenging Angels and Faustian Devils</span><br />They Bite by Anthony Boucher - Locals tell outsider of the haunted house. It's a simple premise that every horror writer has taken on at some point and this one has a little lesson worked into it. Granted the lesson is along the lines of don't be an ass or you'll get bitten but still.<br />The Black Lake by Tony Richards - I always have to remind myself that this isn't a King story. It feels like it could be. Who knew a lake could be such a successful predator?<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The-Raft-King-cover.jpg\" />The Raft by Stephen King - OK, so this one is actually a King story. It has those believable characters and then a crazy (and gory) attack. I probably mix up The Black Lake with this one because they're next to one another and they're both about malevolent lakes, which really isn't a horror category I thought would exist, but there you go. I saw a short film version of it but like a lot of King things, go for the book instead of the movie.<br />Sweets to the Sweet by Robert Bloch - First up, I love the Shakespeare reference. Second, it's another story where children are terrifying. This time the kid's behavior is more justifiable but still, don't mess with kids. If you call someone a witch often enough, will they become one? Bloch is also the guy that wrote Psycho, so you know he can do some quality writing. This is no exception. <br />If Damon Comes by Charles L. Grant - Another horror story about a kid. See how scary kids are? Although this is more like Bloch's tale where the kid being a super creepy is kind of justified. Kinda creepy but not outright scary like some of the other stories in here.<br />Ceremony by William F. Nolan - It's kind of like the Boucher story, where someone gets punished by these \"avenging angels\". Also it's a good reason to avoid taking long bus rides because those always seem to invite creepy things to happen.<br />Dark Angel by Edward Bryant - Don't think that this is like that Jessica Alba TV show. It's a question of how far should revenge go and how do you know when you've gone too far?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Playground+cover.jpg\" />The Playground by Ray Bradbury - Again! children are the creepy factory here. How much can you really protect your children? How far will you go?

And if the clip show is good enough for The Simpsons, then it's good enough for me!<br /><br />Tuesday Top 10 Lists<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/top-halloween-reads\">Top 10 Halloween Reads</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-10-scariest-books\">Top 10 Scariest Books</a><br /><br />Everything's Eventual by Stephen King<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/nine-year-old-boy-i-was-had-done\">The nine-year-old boy I was had done nothing for which he might legitimately fear the devil either...and yet the Devil came</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/mr-maybe-they-will-vs-mr-even-if-i-do\">Mr. Maybe They Will vs. Mr. Even If I Do</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor\">It was the human mind's final great parlor-trick: the perception of eternity in the place where you'd always expected to spend it</a><br /><br />Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/in-short-he-wished-to-know-why-there\">In short, he wished to know why there was no more magic done in England</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/as-everybody-knows-no-one-with-red-hair\">As everybody knows, no one with red hair can ever truly be said to be handsome</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-believe-mr-strange-will-do-very-well\">I believe Mr Strange will do very well in the war, sir.

So I kind of need to trick myself into exercising. Luckily, I'm fairly easy to fool. A few years ago I got a Wii and the next year I got EA Active, one of those workout games. I'm embarrassed to say how much a video game, even if it is an exercise one, kicks my ass.<br /><br />One of the exercises that always destroyed me was squat holds. You have to hold a squat for 40 seconds, all while the \"trainer\" in the game keeps repeating \"hold your squat\" and you really just want to throw things at her, but then you remember if you do that you'll just damage your own TV. So it's all very frustrating and I've never been able to actually hold it for the full time. Until the other day when I figured the key to this was ignoring the timer and blocking the trainer lady out.<br /><br />Normally it's very easy for me to get lost in my own thoughts, but apparently I can only do that if I'm supposed to be paying attention to something. If I'm trying to block something out I suddenly get super focused on whatever I'm trying to ignore. I was trying to think of something I could focus on but nothing was coming to me. I was at a loss for anything and then, right as the countdown began, I started reciting (in my head) the final soliloquy from Midsummer. (\"If we shadows have offended,/Think but this; and all is mended...\"). Apparently this takes me 40 seconds to recite and it also marked the only time I've been able to actually complete this squat hold. Take that annoying trainer lady, who seems really smug normally when you stand up before you're supposed to and she has to tell you to squat again.<br /><br />So first I've got <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/running-motivation\">Harry Potter audiobooks and running</a> (which is going, although still fairly sporadic) and now I have squats and Shakespeare. And that phrase might be my favorite thing I have written on this blog.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-28T13:12:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e575dde2238670002ab","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"literature and fitness","slug":"literature-and-fitness","url":"/articles/tags/literature-and-fitness"}]}]},{"id":"53224e575dde2264190005fb","title":"Top Halloween Reads","slug":"top-halloween-reads","url":"/articles/top-halloween-reads","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TTT3W.jpg\" />This week's <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/10/ten-books-perfect-for-reading-around.html\">Tuesday Top 10, hosted by The Broke and the Bookish</a>,  is right up my alley (haha) so I'm excited to list out my top \"however many I can make it up to\" favorite Halloween reads. <br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-goes-by-many-names-crisis-dark-years\">World</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/who-in-his-right-mind-could-have-been\">War</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/couldnt-just-one-restart-plague-all\">Z</a> by Max Brooks - I've been in a zombie groove and I know lots of people are getting sick of them and by all accounts I should to but I haven't yet. While I may get freaked out while watching The Walking Dead, Brooks's book is the one that gives me nightmares. It's a realistic portrayal of what the world would be like, what the international ties would be like, what the military would be like, what general civilization would be like, if the world was overtaken by zombies.<br /><br />2. The Lottery by Shirley Jackson - I actually just wrote about this one so it's still fresh in my mind. It's such a creepy story that starts out so innocently. <br /><br />3. Everything's Eventual by Stephen King - I included this around last Halloween when I listed out the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-10-scariest-books\">top 10 scariest books</a> but I have to put it on here again because I love the story <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor\">\"1408\"</a>. When you look at it, it's a very simple story (haunted hotel room) but it's told so well and there is so much build up and atmosphere. I remember reading this story, finishing the last page, letting out a big breath (I'd been holding it near the end) and then immediately started the story over again.<br /><br />4. The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris - It's hard to read this book without thinking of Hopkins as Lecter but the story still stands up to the movie. I mean there are not one but two serial killers! And not your everyday \"kill a lot of people\" killers with no imagination but \"wear you like a lady suit\" and \"eat your liver\" type of serial killers. I think I may have a problem.<br /><br />5. The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allen Poe - You really can't have a list of great Halloween stories without including some Poe on here and currently I'm loving this story. There are so many good ones it's hard to choose and this one doesn't have the violence that makes up so many of his other stories, nor does it have the crazy untrustworthy narrator. Similar to King's \"1408\" this is all about atmosphere and being unable to escape your horrors. Beautiful language and imagry.<br /><br />8. Titus Andronicus by William Shakespeare - The gore alone in this story makes it a good Halloween read, especially if you're looking for something that will impress people at dinner parties. Assuming those people aren't really all that familiar with Shakespeare and don't realize that this play is, as the Reduced Shakespeare Company referred to it, Shakespeare's \"Quentin Tarantino phase\". There limbs keep getting hacked off, tongues cut out, ladies (OK, just one lady) ravaged, madness, and the whole thing is bookended with cannibalism. Plus it has some of the best one liners (\"Villain, I have done thy mother.\") so really, what's not to love? <br /><br />7. A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore - I figured I'll now veer into some of the not-so-scary but still good Halloween reads and Moore's A Dirty Job is a good place to start. I mean it has a beta male who finds out he's death (with a little \"d\" which is different from Death, the big guy) and there are Hell Hounds (they're great with kids) and little creatures roaming the sewers watching everything and a vampire makes a cameo and my favorite, the emperor of San Francisco. All this with Moore's humor.<br /><br />8. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith - I know I've written about this one ad nauseam but it's so much fun. The literary (and there's a lot of Austen in here, so you better like her stuff) and the ridiculous (zombies. It's right there in the title) mash up so any time there are one too many long balls or carriage rides the monsters bust in and shake things up a bit. Also there are ninjas.<br /><br />9. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark by Alvin Schwartz, illustrated by Stephen Gammell - I included this on my last Halloween list as well but it is that good. Honestly, it's scarier than numbers 7 and 8 but it is meant for kids. I still love these books but the stories aren't super scary like I remember them. However, those Gammell illustrations are still terrifying today. Who let that guy illustrate something for children? Actually, my outrage is completely feigned as I saw somewhere there was a new version of the books with different, cuddlier illustrations and that was blasphemy. <br /><br />10. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/in-short-he-wished-to-know-why-there\">Jonathan</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/as-everybody-knows-no-one-with-red-hair\">Strange</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-believe-mr-strange-will-do-very-well\">&amp;</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-am-sure-you-are-very-different-sort\">Mr</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/think-of-me-with-my-nose-in-book\">Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke - Historical fiction plus wizards. It's not a horror story but there are creepy characters and hidden histories that make this a wonderful but not terrifying October read.<br /><br />Oh hey, look! I made it to 10. So what are your favorite Halloween reads?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-25T13:11:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e575dde2264190005fc","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e575dde2223b6000126","title":"There is no delight the equal of dread","slug":"there-is-no-delight-the-equal-of-dread","url":"/articles/there-is-no-delight-the-equal-of-dread","body":"Now I'm onto part 2 of <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/it-was-this-unfathomable-longing-of\">Horrorscapes </a>called The Horror We Do. Sometimes horror is caused by the supernatural and sometimes it's just people who suck. I guess that's the simplified way of describing it but I am here to simplify.  The horror that we do  is, in general, my preferred type of horror fiction. I may get freaked out watching the supernatural stuffg as well, but it's the horrors coming from the mundane, the realistic stuff,  that keeps me awake at night.<br /><br />So I figured I do 2 quick mini-reviews of the stories in this part because I can't pick just one to talk about. So here we go:<br /><br />The Horror We Do<br />The Lottery by Shirley Jackson<br />Dread by Clive Barker<br />Something About Camilla by Juleen Brantingham<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Lottery+cover.jpg\" />First up, \"The Lottery\" by Shirley Jackson. Have you read this one yet? If not, just stop reading this and <a href=\"http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/lotry.html\">go read it</a>. This is absolutely going to contain spoilers. Really the fact that I'm writing about it as a horror story is already kind of a spoiler so I apologize for that. If you had just read it already, we wouldn't be in this mess<br />This is a messed up story that makes me repeat \"WTF people?\" when I finish it. Seriously, every time I have that reaction, even when I know what's coming. According to the intro before the story, when this was first published in The New Yorker many people were \"disturbed to the point of cancelling their subscriptions,\" which is awesome. I want to get that powerful of a reaction out of people. Granted I just picture people with monocles and top hats reading this and then crying \"Good heavens!\" or \"What the devil?!\" when they get to the end, so it may not be the most difficult group to shock, but still. It starts out so innocently, with a small town and everyone taking part in this lottery that at first sounds kind of like a game. Then slowly you get these feeling that something is off but you can't figure out what. And then it ends with a lady being stoned to death by her friends and family and how can you finish this and not be like WTF? and have your monocle go flying off? It's so scary because these seem like normal people. There's nothing sinister about them or the town; they're just doing what they've always done. And that is the scary part. They're doing it because they've always done it and how many things can you think of people do just because it's always been done that way?<br />Spoilers are contained, but seriously, just read the story.<br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jI3XZFTRPY0/TqS2bUYEpyI/AAAAAAAAAb4/0DB_5Y4cnY0/s200/Dread+cover.jpeg\" />Now I need to mention Clive Barker's \"Dread\" because it also makes you go WTF people, but you don't have the same innocence that is part of \"The Lottery\". It's also much more violent, much more graphic, than anything else in the book so far. The character Quaid is looking to study and understand dread. And isn't that, on some level, what anyone reading horror fiction is doing? You want to be scared from a safe distance. Goshgarian says in the intro to Horrorscapes<br /><blockquote>What horror fiction does is allow us to partake in horror and terror at a distance. It's a safe way of giving into primitive pleasure, of speculating about unseen powers, impossible creatures, and a dark nature. It's a way of getting scared without being scared.</blockquote>Quaid doesn't want to be scared, but he wants to experience and understand other people's dread. Which means the other people must be scared. He argues the concept as a philosophical notion and he can riddle prettily, but he's interested in more than just the academic side of things. I suppose it's the difference between reading something in a book and learning about it first hand. It's just messed up when other people's dread is what you're most interested in.<br /><br />I'm trying to keep this one spoiler free, so you don't have to actually read all of these stories in order to read the post. So again I'll just repeat how my professor described Barker: \"[The] stories are powerful and raw. The violence is extreme, the sex explicit, and the horror exquisite.\" Enjoy.<br /><br />\"Something About Camilla\" is a good story and if it wasn't up against these other two I would definitely enjoy it more. But these are two powerful stories and it's hard to compete with them.<br /><br />Title quote from page 55, from the story \"Dread\" by Clive Barker.<br /><br />Goshgarian, Gary ed. Horrorscape. Kendall Press, 1993.<br /><br />Seriously, don't watch The Walking Dead with me. I am normally a very passive TV/movie viewer but that show seems to require me to spend half the time screaming and the other half yelling instructions to the characters. Like \"in the brain, you moron!\" when characters seem to spend time hacking at other parts and that is a total waste of time and quit using your gun, you know the noise only draws more of them to you!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:27+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-24T13:04:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e575dde2223b6000127","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Clive Barker","slug":"clive-barker","url":"/articles/tags/clive-barker"},{"value":"Shirley Jackson","slug":"shirley-jackson","url":"/articles/tags/shirley-jackson"},{"value":"Gary Goshgarian","slug":"gary-goshgarian","url":"/articles/tags/gary-goshgarian"},{"value":"The Lottery","slug":"the-lottery","url":"/articles/tags/the-lottery"},{"value":"Horrorscape","slug":"horrorscape","url":"/articles/tags/horrorscape"},{"value":"Dread","slug":"dread","url":"/articles/tags/dread"}]}]},{"id":"53224e585dde22fdcf000513","title":"who do we review for","slug":"who-do-we-review-for","url":"/articles/who-do-we-review-for","body":"Awhile back Jeff from <a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2011/05/eight-questions-about-state-and-future.html\">The Reading Ape had asked a series of questions about book blogging</a> and invited <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/why-do-we-book-blog\">people to respond</a>. The questions were mostly about the purpose of book blogging and why do we blog. I was just thinking about this this afternoon as I went to start a review of a different sort.<br /><br />Sometimes, and it's very sporadic, I'll write restaurant reviews on Yelp. I don't write reviews elsewhere for any other product. Not even Amazon reviews for books I'm already reviewing on my own blog.  While I'm very clear that I won't write only positive reviews on my own blog, I only write glowing Yelp reviews. This is part of the reason for the sporadic-ness, because I'll only write a review if I loved the restaurant.<br /><br />I never really gave this a second thought until today, for whatever reason. Why would I only write positive Yelp reviews? How is that different than the book reviews I write on my own blog? And I realized there are two major differences: where I'm writing the review and who I'm writing it for.<br /><br />With book reviews or posts or whatever you'd like to call them, I'm writing them for myself and for you guys reading What Red Read. I want to recommend books I've loved, I want to warn people away from books I've hated and most of all I want to have a discussion about books and other bookish topics. So I make sure I review all of the books I read and I make sure to review them honestly. On top of that, I'm writing these reviews on my own personal blog. I know I personally take recommendations from particular book bloggers based on how much I trust their reviews and I try to keep that in mind with my own blog.<br /><br />When it comes to restaurant reviews, I'm really writing them for the restaurant. If I have a favorite restaurant, I want other people to go there and see how awesome it is and I want the restaurant to stay in business and continue to feed me delicious food. And I know how often I use sites like Yelp to find new restaurants, so I want to lead other people to my favorite places. Now I'll write a bad review but only if the restaurant is really bad. I mean I ended up with severe food poisoning while the cooks spit in my food in front of me and the wait staff actively ignore me. But I don't feel any need to write a review for every restaurant I go to. And because I'm not writing these reviews on my own personal blog I don't expect people are reading the reviews to see what Alley has to say, but instead are just getting an idea of if this restaurant will kill them or not.<br /><br />Do you review things (books, restaurants, whatever) anywhere else? Do you find you review things differently in the different places?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:28+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:28+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-23T02:10:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e585dde22fdcf000514","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Blogging question","slug":"blogging-question","url":"/articles/tags/blogging-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e585dde2238670002ac","title":"It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself","slug":"it-was-this-unfathomable-longing-of-the-soul-to-vex-itself","url":"/articles/it-was-this-unfathomable-longing-of-the-soul-to-vex-itself","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Horrorscape-cover.jpg\" />For my next Halloween-worthy read I decided to scan my own bookshelves in an attempt to save some money, and I stumbled on a packet I had for one of my college classes. Specifically for my Horror Fiction class. And if that doesn't indicate some good Halloweeny reads, I don't know what is.<br /><br />The packet is a selection of short horror fiction stories pulled together by my professor and has an intro to horror fiction overall as well as brief information about each of the stories. I loved this class (and ended up taking 2 more of the professors courses: the modern bestseller and science fiction) but haven't revisited most of these stories since I first read them and figured now is a perfect opportunity.<br /><br />The packet/book/whatever is split into 4 parts: Dark Roots; The Horror We Do; Belief and The Supernatural; and Avenging Angels and Faustian Devils. I feel like it's difficult to write about a collection of short storiesg. Do you write about the collection overall? (If so, how cos I have no idea how to even go about that.) Do you write about all of the stories? Just a couple? How do you pick which ones? To solve this problem I decided to split up my posts based on the different sections and select one (or two if I can't help myself) of the stories from each parts. Excited? I bet you are. Here we go!<br /><br />Part 1: Dark Roots<br />The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allan Poe<br />The Black Cat by Edgar Allan Poe<br />The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe<br />The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar by Edgar Allan Poe<br />Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe<br />The Monkey's Paw by W.W. Jacobs<br /><br />The first part is clearly Poe heavy, but obviously Poe is one of the grandfather's of the genre, so expect to see the guy there. Personally out of these stories, my favorite is the Jacob's contribution with \"The Monkey's Paw\". Since I'm sure everyone is familiar with Poe (and if you aren't, fix that!) and also because this is my blog, I'm gonna talk about the ape appendage.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/simpson-monkey-paw.jpg\" />Simpson's covered the story so I'm going to assume that means there is no need for spoiler warnings. Or I guess this counts as your spoiler warning. Also if you haven't read it yet, go do that. <a href=\"http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/mnkyspaw.htm\">Here's a link</a> to make this easy for you.<br /><br />\"The Monkey's Paw\" is a story I can read again and again. It's short (all of 9 pages), but it's full of such a creepy atmosphere.  And I love a creepy atmosphere. It starts out with such a sweet domestic scene, father and son playing chess next to the fire while mom sits nearby knitting. Doesn't get too much more Norman Rockwell-ier than that. And then things get all messed up by this \"old friend\" and his mysterious monkey paw. I put \"old friend\" in quotes because he may have warned them against using the paw but he certainly talked it up and made it sound like something you had to see. And of course in the end he did give it to them, after a half-hearted attempt to destroy it by throwing it into the fire. You know, after bringing it up in the first place. So this paw will grant you wishes, but it will make it just seem like it's a coincidence so you can never really be sure the paw did anything. And of course this wouldn't be a horror story if the coincidence/wish didn't mean something terrible for the family, which is all the more cruel because this is an innocent family. The father even says at one point he can't think of a thing he'd wish for because he already has everything he could ever want (Awwww). Then a simple wish of two hundred pounds brings the death of the son and so much misery. You can't help but feel heartbroken right along with the family.<br /><br />No matter how many times I've read the story, no matter that I already know how it ends, I always wish things to be different while knowing they're going to end unhappily. It is a good reminder not to mess with fate.<br /><br />I ran into the problem of writing about a collection of short stories last October when I wrote about <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/such-ordinary-things-make-me-afraid\">Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories</a>.

Well at least since the movie came out and I heard not only what the original ending was but the typical refrains of \"The book is soooo much better.\" I was happy then, to see that an ecopy of this book was on sale through Amazon. Plus it fits in nicely with the horror theme of the month, so there's another win.<br /><br />The premise is what intrigued me to both see the movie and read the book. The main character, Robert Neville, is the seemingly last man on Earth. A pandemic has swept the nation turning all those that are infected into these vampire/zombie hybrid things and for whatever reason Neville is immune. His days are spent on survival: repairing any damage to his home/fortress, stocking up on supplies, making stakes, peeling garlic, killing the vampires and looking for any signs of uninfected life. He is tormented by the vampires each night as they surround his house, taunting him to come out. He's in a deep depression, pretty understandably so, and has no joy, not even in disposing of the infected bodies, both those that are completely taken over by the disease, and those who are somewhat still alive but will succumb eventually.<br />gThis part is a bit spoiler-y. Though I knew it before hand and I don't think it ruined anything. But decide for yourself<br />After years of this solitary vampire slayer life he learns that those who are infected but still alive have figured out a way to live with the disease and they view him as a threat because he keeps spending his days killing everyone. That's when he realizes that he's actually the anomaly and he is the legend of their nightmares (hence the story's title).  So really, the spoiler is kind of right there in the title.<br />Spoilers contained<br /><br /> Here's the thing, I wish the book was written by someone else. I love the idea of the book, I think it's a great story. I just hated the execution of it. You don't get a lot of insight into the characters. I suppose it makes sense you don't get too much about the vampires, including Ben Corman, Neville's old friend. But it would have been nice if Neville was a fully rounded out character. And then there's all the pseudo-science thrown in that does nothing to explain anything going on. It mostly felt like Matheson had come across a medical encyclopedia and decided to thrown lots of terms at his story. I can accept a lot of \"realities\" from a story, including one where zombie/vampires take of the world. But when you try to throw some jargon at me and explain that Neville is immune because a vampire bat bite him when he was in Panama, I loudly yell \"bullshit\" and start laughing. I don't mind pseudo-science in my horror/sci-fi stories. I expect there to be some. I just don't expect it to be so obviously bad.<br /><br />Also Neville is constantly drinking. I don't have a problem with this, nor does it seem unusual that a very depressed person who is the last living man on earth, would spend a good amount of his time drunk. Or actually, he ends up drinking very little because he spends most of the time spilling it onto the floor or pouring it into a glass, only to then throw the glass at a wall. Somewhere in this desolate world is an unending supply of whiskey and bar glasses. I think the drinking was a shortcut to try to show depth of the character but unfortunately it didn't work. It could have worked, maybe with a different author.<br /><br />There is one scene that worked. Or at least worked better than the others. One day Neville sees a dog wandering about during the daylight and over the next few weeks he slowly gains the dog's trust. It's so simple but you can feel Neville's desperation to connect with any living thing.<br /><br />So there you go: interesting premise that I wish I could have seen a different author take on.<br /><br />Title quote from location 910<br /><br />Matheson, Richard.

This week they ask what are the top 10 book covers or book titles that made you want to pick up that book?<br /><br />I make a lot of my reading selections based on a good cover or an intriguing cover. It's my favorite part of going to a bookstore and it's the part that shopping online can't replace. I've never been able to browse books online like I can at a bookstore. These are books either I've read or want to read largely based on their cover and/or title. I put all the titles at the bottom of the post because trying to get it to format nicely in text was making me want to throw things.<br /><br />1. Why Do Men Have Nipples? by Mark Leyner and Billy Goldberg - I actually have the other 2 books in, what I guess you could call a series, Why Do Mean Fall Asleep After Sex and Let's Play Doctor but those don't have the same intrigue as that first book. And if you're curious, guys have nipples cos they start out as ladies while in the womb.<br /><br />2. Shakespeare and Modern Culture by Marjorie Garber - Shakespeare in the title and bright colors. How could I not be drawn in?<br /><br />3. An Exaltation of Larks by James Lipton - It's a \"classic collection of collective nouns\" with things like \"a gaggle of geese,\" \"a rash of dermatologists,\" or maybe \"a panic of paranoids\".  And it's by James \"Inside the Actors Studio\" Lipton.<br /><br />4. Full Frontal Feminism by Jessica Valenti - I'm amazingly immature so seeing \"full frontal\" makes me giggle. And then \"feminism\" makes me want to pick it up.<br /><br />5. Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer - Ultimately I read this because of some great reviews but it had been on my radar because that cover just stands out.<br /><br />6. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith - This is a book title and cover that makes you pause. It worked for me. I picked it up when the person in front of me in line decided last minute she didn't want it. Her loss, my gain.<br /><br />7. You Suck: A Love Story by Christopher Moore - Now I'm a big fan of the guy but before I had read any of his stuff I saw this book sitting on one of the tables. The bright cover and the title got me to check him out and I'm so happy that I did.<br /><br />8. The Corrections<span> </span>by Jonathan Franzen - Before I knew anything about Franzen this book caught my eye. I actually think if I never ended up finding out more about the guy I would have read this by now. I will get to it. Eventually.<br /><br />9. The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan - Omnivores are having a dilemma? But I am an omnivore. And bam, just like that, I am now interested in a book despite the fact that the cover is one I'd normally walk right by.<br /><br />10. How I Became A Famous Novelist by Steve Hely - It's such a simple cover, but it stands out. It's the type of book I would normally pick up off of those tables they have scattered about a bookstore. I haven't picked this one up yet, but I plan on it.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Top-Covers-1-5.jpg\" /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Top-Covers-6-10.jpg\" /><br />gFair warning, I'm writing this while watching the Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead.

Granted I was given the gift months ago, but seeing how I am no good at doing anything in a reasonable amount of time, only a few months after the fact seems pretty good.<br /><br />Check out these book earrings. Adorable, no? The best part, they're actual little journals. Now I could never write anything in them because I can't write nor read something that small, but the fact that they are actual little leather journals with actual pages inside makes me happy.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Book-Earrings.jpg\" />Normally earrings shaped like objects aren't really my thing, but these I love. I love them cos they're bookish, I love them because they came from a dear friend and I love them because they're from a place I loved and miss. Which does mean it may be slightly difficult (though not impossible) if you wanted to pick up a pair. I've mentioned this a few times on here, but my friend and I studied for a semester in Italy. My friend was back that way and she picked these up for me because she's pretty awesome.

It's about how Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford is actually the author of Shakespeare's works. See aristocrats shouldn't be messing around with the theater. That's for trashy people. But Edward just had to <strike>dance</strike> write. So he wrote the stuff but got this poor player William Shakespeare to be his front man.<br /><br />I don't plan on seeing this movie. Not because \"how dare they\" or anything but more because there are a bunch of other movies I'd like to see but I'm lazy and don't make it to the movies that often. Also cheap. So I guess I'm saying if it's someday on TV and there's nothing else on or the remote is really far away I might watch it. I believe Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare (kooky idea, right?) but I like a good conspiracy theory as much as the next person. But really, if you're going to make an <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Anti-Stratfordian\">anti-Stratfordian</a> movie, let's at least go all out.<br /><br />By that I mean, if you're going to make a movie that says Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, why not go with Marlowe as the actual writer? I don't believe it anymore than I believe de Vere or Bacon or any of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shakespeare_authorship_candidates\">other 70+ candidates for Shakespearian authorship</a>. It's just that at least it makes a good story. Here are the basics<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Christopher+Marlowe.jpg\" />Marlowe is a successful dramatist, with his plays The Jew of Malta and Doctor Faustus bringing in all the groundlings. But he's also a spy! (Dun dun duuunn) He was a spy for the Queen, who got him out of a couple tight situations, so it seems he had some powerful friends. But powerful friends can only help you so much when blasphemy is on the line and your roommate Kyd sells you out. Marlowe is reputed to be an atheist so even the Queen is having trouble making this thing go away. What to do? Oh, a faked death you say? Perfect!  Marlowe gets in a bar fight over a bill and is stabbed in the eye and killed. Just days before he's supposed to go on trial for heresy. They probably went with the eye-stabbing because you can't cut the breaks on a horse. Now he hangs out in Italy for awhile and let's things back in London blow over. But he also must <strike>dance</strike> write. So he gets an old contemporary of his to take his works and claim them as his own. And that is how you do an anti-Stratfordian conspiracy theory<br /><br />See how much better that story is? Spies! Atheists! Faked death! Also there's a chance Marlowe might have been gay, so there's that to. So what would you rather: a guy who was too fancy to write or an Elizabethan James Bond for whom even faked death couldn't stop his need to write? Exactly.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:29+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:29+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-13T12:54:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e595dde2238670002af","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Shakespeare","slug":"shakespeare","url":"/articles/tags/shakespeare"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5a5dde2223b600012a","title":"But there was no way to turn back gracefully now.","slug":"but-there-was-no-way-to-turn-back-gracefully-now","url":"/articles/but-there-was-no-way-to-turn-back-gracefully-now","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Choke+On+Your+Lies+cover.jpg\" />Choke On Your Lies is an interesting premise. When the story starts out it seems like something out of a <a href=\"http://bookriot.com/2011/10/06/the-white-male-fck-up-novel-a-guest-post-by-john-warner/\">The White Male Fuck-Up Novel</a> (thanks <a href=\"http://bookriot.com/\">BookRiot</a>!): guy's wife has just told him she wants a divorce and the house and guy finds out wife has been cheating on him. And the guy Mick is pretty pathetic. No, I'm sorry, painfully pathetic. If I wasn't already familiar with Anthony Neil Smith's work like Hogdoggin' I'd assume this is going to be something along the lines of Tropper's This Is Where I Leave You. But no no, Smith has something else in mind. And that something else is Octavia.<br /><br />Octavia is an awful person that you start rooting for against all better judgement. She's not even a misunderstood person, a bitch with a heart of gold. She does have some people she's close to and she's very loyal to them. She's far from kind to them, just loyal.  But otherwise she is spiteful and snobbish and a genius who has no problem manipulating people for her own needs. Actually it's not just that she has no problem, it's that she enjoys manipulating people. It's her hobby. She's a big girl and she uses that weight to make her living by suing big name companies for discriminating against her. Now she's decided to throw her weightg behind Mick and help him with his impending divorce to \"punish the bitch\". Mick knows this is a mistake but when his soon-to-be ex-wife tries to steal the house from him with a forged document it's enough for him to accept Octavia's help.<br /><blockquote>I just hoped I wasn't opening her Pandora's box, for I was sure there was no hope to be found at the bottom.</blockquote>So of course what starts with such a simple premise turns so dark with a crazy dinner party, drug busts, a few murders, some blackmail and a swingers club. See what happens when you let Octavia loose? I don't mean to suggest she orchestrated all this stuff but you certainly get the feeling that this could have been an almost amicable divorce if she hadn't gotten involved. And that is what makes it such an engaging story; to know the characters make a small decision and then they have to deal with the consequences of that moment for the rest of the story.<br /><br />Side note, the strange relationship between Jennings and Octavia provided some of my favorite moments that made me both like and hate Octavia that much more.<br /><br />Pun!

I'm still working on that shark fear thingg but I finally tackled Murakami. And I loved it. What was I so worried about?<br /><br />Granted I went with what I believe is one of the easier, more linear stories and I picked up Norwegian Wood. At least other bloggers told me it was a good one to start with. I can't say yet, but I do plan on picking up some more Murakami's stuff. So if you have any recommendations, please let me know.<br /><br />It's sort of a love story but it's not sickeningly romantic. It deals with a lot of suicide and death, and loss but it's not melodramatic or heart-string-tugging. There's a love triangle but you don't spend the whole time going \"of course the main character is going to pick person A because the other person is a major douche face and the fact that douche face is even a consideration makes me hate the main character\". The characters are wonderful and vulnerable and I loved reading about them. I don't think this is going to be a very effective review to convince those to read it who haven't before. I'm not sure what to say because all I want to do is gush about 2 of the characters and the gushing will really only make sense if you already know the characters. So for those of you that know the book, enjoy. For those that don't, you should read it. And then come back and read this.<br /><br />1. I love Midori. I loved her. Even when she was being a bit of a bitch I still loved her. I read this on my Kindle so I marked down a bunch of quotes I liked and most of them were from her. She's outgoing and direct and kind of ridiculous and just wonderful. It would have been easy to make her annoying and obnoxious and unfeeling but Murakami is better than that.<br /><br />2. I love Reiko too. Probably because she reminds me of Midori only it's a Midori you could go to for advice. And she plays the guitar. A musical Midori. OK, I guess it's unfair to only think of her as a version of another character but she's another very strong, outgoing and direct character. Plus I was completely drawn into her story within the larger story.<br /><br />So to sum up: I got over my fear of reading Murakami and plan on checking out more of his stuff, but I'm still irrationally afraid of sharks. I love Midori and Reiko and would rather gush about them than write a useful review. You should read this book.<br /><br />I'm actually listening to the song \"Norwegian Wood\" while writing this. I didn't plan it that way but I was Googling the book so I could make sure I was spelling Murakami correctly and the first link that popped up was a YouTube clip for the song. I probably would have ignored it but the top comment was \"This song gives me wood\" and I started giggling because I'm immature, so I decided to listen.<br /><br />No, seriously, I have this major problem with deep water and stuff living in there. I know logically it's a stupid fear and I loved sharks when I was little so I don't know where this fear came from. I do know it's enough that I have trouble completing water levels in video games.

This week's topic is top ten book endings that left me with my mouth hanging open, maybe because of a cliffhanger when dammit, this story was supposed to give me some resolution jerks. Maybe because that was so amazing . Maybe because it was so awful I can't believe the author screwed me like that, coping out as they did.<br /><br />This is going to be spoilery because I'm going to be talking about endings. That should be obvious but in case it wasn't, here's your warning.<br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/there-was-no-after-only-end\">Hogdoggin' by Anthony Neil Smith</a> - I specifically mentioned the ending in my review. I loved it because it just happens. Normally if an author has an ending just jump out at you you're pissed. But that's only if the author just does that cos they don't know where to go. Smith knows what he's doing and things drop out right when the tension was high and it was fantastic.<br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/i-am-getting-better-at-smiling-when\">Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</a> - This was a case where I felt like the author did just drop the the ending on me. There is so much build up to what happened and what will Melinda do and will she speak again? And then there's the confrontation and about 6 pages later the book is over and she's healing and we're done. It was overall a good book but the ending let me down.<br /><br />3. Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix by J.K. Rowling - Yeah there are surprises and shock and whatnot in the other HP books, but this is the one that got me. Because I loved Sirius and this was before Rowling started killing people off left and right in all of the books so I wasn't expecting this major character to be bumped off. I had started re-reading the series sometime before I started this blog but I stopped after I got a few pages into the 5th book because I didn't want to get to the ending.<br /><br />4. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/its-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never\">Gone, Baby, Gone by Dennis Lehane</a> - Even thought I knew the ending of this book going in, that doesn't make it less powerful. Both endings, where you find out what's happened to Amanda and where you see what Helene is up to at the end, just leave you shocked and angry. And angry. Not at Lehane but at Helene cos what the hell?<br /><br />5. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-am-sure-you-are-very-different-sort\">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke</a> - The book is 800 some odd pages longg, and not all pages that fly by, and yet when it ended I wasn't quite ready yet. Probably because it ends on a cliffhanger and you want to know what else is going to happen because apparently 800+ pages wasn't enough. You're both happy with the ending and ready for some more.<br /><br />I'm sure there are more great/terrifying/shocking/awful endings that I've read but I'm coming up blank right now. I'm going to blame this on a food coma brought on by pumpkin pecan cheesecake which was amazing. See I told you I was going to start getting to all of those great pumpkin foods in October.<br /><br />So what are your top book endings that left you with your mouth hanging open? <br /><br />I would give a more specific page number except my copy of the book is upstairs. And I am downstairs. And I'm lazy.<br /> Actually I wrote this last night but now I'm sitting in the room right next to where the book is. And I'm still not checking because I haven't had enough coffee yet. Just, it's a lot of pages.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:31+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:31+00:00","published_at":"2011-10-04T13:09:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5b5dde2238670002b1","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5b5dde2223b600012c","title":"September Reader Wrap-Up","slug":"september-reader-wrap-up","url":"/articles/september-reader-wrap-up","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/september-calendar.jpg\" />September got away from me. I really don't know how it happened. All of a sudden September is gone and it's already October. I wish I could say I was doing lots of super, awesome, amazing things this month and that's why the month has gotten away from me and I've gotten so little reading done. But that's not the case. Or I did a lot of awesome stuff and then hit my head and I have very odd amnesia. This is all an intro to say I haven't done much reading this month and I don't have a reason why. So really, this intro is a big waste of time.

Why do people ask that books get banned? I mean, I see all the reasons that are given: sexual content, explicit language, drug use, promoting socialism (frealzies you guys?), violence. But what do they really hope banning a book will accomplish? Other than shining a big spotlight on these books and getting even more people to read them. Unless, that is their idea. Sneaky, sneaky marketing.<br /><br />Look, I get that some material is inappropriate for children. I'm not saying that every child should be reading everything that's out there. Hell, sometimes I wish I hadn't read American Psycho cos, really, I didn't need to know anything that had to do with that rat sceneg. And if/when I have a kid, I'm sure I'm not going to want them to read certain things, at least until they're old enough to understand it. But that doesn't mean I think I should decide what that guy down the street should be allowed to read.Oh, parents should also know exactly what it is they're banning, because whenever I read someone's rant about why a book should be banned from a school it's pretty clear that the person has never bothered to read the book. At least know what you're complaining about.<br /><br />Maybe it takes a certain level of vanity to believe you know best for everyone. And I do think this is the case, because book banners seem to think they're doing a good thing. Their intentions are good even if the result is dumb.Unless of course they're hoping these books will get more attention. In which case, you have succeeded.<br /><br />Since I wrote this a couple other bloggers have posted their thoughts on book banning that I encourage you to check out if you haven't already<br /><a href=\"http://deadwhiteguyslit.blogspot.com/2011/09/banned-book-week-can-your-kids-read.html\">Dead White Guys: Can Your Kids Read Whatevs?</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/09/irony-of-banning-books.html\">Dead End Follies: The Irony of Banning Books</a><br /><br />Anyway, to build on <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/banned-books\">my last post</a> where I bragged about books I had read (or am shamed by the ones I didn't, depending on your view) here are the books that have been most often banned/challenged/etc in 2010/2011 that I have read and recommend. Some of them because they're super awesome amazing (Brave New World) and some because I think they're just pretty good but they're banned so that's how you know they're better than normal (Speak).<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/2011banned.pdf\">2010/2011 Banned books</a><br /><br /><a href=\"h://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/bannedbooksweek/ideasandresources/free_downloads/ttp://whatredread.com/2011/i-am-getting-better-at-smiling-when\">Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</a><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky<br />Nickled and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/at-end-of-my-search-i-wanted-to-be-able\">Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer</a><br />Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson<br />The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night Time by Mark Haddon<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/brave-new-world-first-few-chapters\">Brave</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/quick-thoughts-chapters-6-7\">New</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/brave-new-world-last-thoughts\">World</a> by Aldous Huxley<br />Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison<br />The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger<br />Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut<br />The Awakening by Kate Chopin<br /><br />I feel like it's important to know that having completed the book, I proceeded to get at least 2 1/2 other people to read it. Because I'm a sharer. And also because I had these images burned into my brain, so someone is joining me. 1 was on purpose and she already had an idea of what she was getting into because she's a fan of Ellis and had lent me The Rules of Attraction. Then she and I tried to convince someone else to read it, but that person never finished it. Smart lady. Boyfriend is the other one who finished it, although I actually tried to talk him out of it. He brought it with him on a long work trip and told me about it after he was already gone. I warned him not to read it and he just kept telling me he can handle a little violence. Until he got around 1/2 way through and I got phone calls that were closer to \"WTF is wrong with this guy??? Why, why, why did that happen??\"<br /><br />I had a high school History teacher who listened to an entire Eminem album (I think the second one judging by when I had this teacher but who knows) because his son wanted the album but obviously there had been some controversy around the rapper. After listening to it he decided it was fine for his kid. And that is what being a parent is about: listening to an entire Eminem album to decide if it's OK for your kid. You know, at least that's what I took from that lecture and also I have no kids so what do I know.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:32+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:32+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-28T13:21:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5c5dde226419000602","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"banned books","slug":"banned-books","url":"/articles/tags/banned-books"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5c5dde226419000603","title":"Books I want to re-read","slug":"books-i-want-to-re-read","url":"/articles/books-i-want-to-re-read","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" />I'm a bit (a lot) late on this topic but it's still Tuesday so here I am. The question for this week's Tuesday Top Ten, hosted by The Broke and The Bookish, is about books I want to re-read. I felt like I should do this because I re-read a lot. It's not that I don't have plenty of new titles out there I want to explore. It's just that sometimes I want to curl up with something I already know I love versus reading something new that could end up sucking. This blog has cut down my re-reads but they're still there. Since the beginning of the year 21% of my books are still re-readsg. Keeping that in mind, I'm going to actually list my favorite books that I love to re-read.<br /><br />1. The Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde - I mention this all the time, I know, but I love the series. Love it. It's a quick read and at this point it's like visiting with old friends.<br /><br />2. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling - I'm actually listening to it now on the few and far between cases when I run. But it's been great motivation not only to keep running but to actually get off my butt and run because I want to continue the story.<br /><br />3. Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner - I think I've read it 5 times but I still love it. It's a quick read but very interesting. Especially the chapter on names<br /><br />4. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/were-all-fates-bastards\">Fool by Christopher Moore</a> - I was actually thinking about how I wanted to read this again when I realized I've recently re-read it already. At least since I started this blog. I'll push it off a little longer but that may mean I'll need more Moore soon.<br /><br />5. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-loved-idea-that-you-could-never-be\">Neither Here</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/travel-is-more-fun-hell-life-is-more\">Nor There</a> by Bill Bryson - Bill Bryson is probably the author I've re-read the most. Whenever I'm not sure what I want to read next but I know I want something quick that will make me smile I reach for his stuff. And this is my favorite of his, so it's the one I end up re-reading the most.<br /><br />6. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-think-you-showed-lot-of-heart-lot-of\">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)</a> by The Reduced Shakespeare Company - I honestly can't even count how many times I've read this one. I used to pick it up about once a month, but it's short so it can be finished in a couple hours.<br /><br />7. A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare - I love this play. I won't argue that it is the best Shakespeare play, but it is my favorite. I have 5 copies of it (1 normal, 1 in a complete works, 1 in a complete comedies, 1 in Italian and 1 a copy of the First Folio) so I have to make use.<br /><br />8. Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand and The Complete-As-One-Could-Be Guide to Modern Myths by N.E. Genge - I don't know what it is about urban legends, but I seek them out. I haven't read these two books in awhile but they are well-worn copies.<br /><br />9. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth Grahme-Smith - I'm so close to having a respectable entry in this list and I blow it by adding zombies. But what can I say, I love Austen's language and I like when things start to get dull that zombies show up.<br /><br />10. To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee - Oh! I thought of a classy entry. There are a few times recently I've thought of picking this up again but I wouldn't know what to say about it on here, so I haven't picked it up again. Yet. But that's coming.<br /><br />yes that's the actual percentage because I'm a super nerd and have this tracked in excel.<br />Have I made my super nerdiness sufficiently obvious yet?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:32+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:32+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-27T22:54:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5c5dde226419000604","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5c5dde2238670002b2","title":"Racism is not...merely \"xenophobia\"","slug":"racism-is-not-dot-dot-dot-merely-xenophobia","url":"/articles/racism-is-not-dot-dot-dot-merely-xenophobia","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Racism+A+Short+History+cover.jpg\" />Having finished up <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/then-get-going-before-this-civil-rights\">Kathryn Stockett's The Help</a> I was planning on sticking with the topic of race and was going to read Octavia E. Butler's Kindred. I assumed I could get it on my Kindle and was surprised to find that I could not. Bummer. I considered going with a different Butler book but then I got cheap and just went with a book I already had on my shelf. So instead I read Racism: A Short History by George M. Fredrickson. The book is leftover from a class I took in college, The History of Race. Though I bought it for the class, I never read it for the class, though I'll have you know I had the highest grade in the class so win for me. My English/bullshitting degree was doing its job before it was even fully earned.<br /><br />Fredrickson looks briefly at the ideology of racism in the Western world from Middle Ages to present, though he focuses on antisemitism in Nazi Germany, Jim Crowe era Southern American history and apartheid in South Africa. It's an interesting topic and Fredrickson should be commended for taking on a potentially controversial topic and remaining objective about it. However, that objectivity could be its downfall. The book is very dry and very academic. Observe the opening lines:<br /><blockquote>\"The term 'racism' is often used in a loose and unreflective way to describe the hostile or negative feelings of one ethnic group or 'people' toward another and the actions resulting from such attitudes. But sometimes the antipathy of one group toward another is expressed and acted upon with a single-mindedness and brutality that go far beyond group-centered prejudice and snobbery that seem to constitute an almost universal human failing.\" </blockquote>Are you falling asleep yet? Because to be honest, this book put me to sleep a couple times. Not the most ringing endorsement of a book, I know. But there is a lot of good stuff in here and a lot of good points. It's just a little hidden. Or not hidden, just not immediately obvious.<br /><br />One thing in particular that has stuck with me is how all connected things are. You can't look at racism in different countries as separate entities from one another. He argues the Nazi occupation in Germany and the Holocaust played an important part in the civil rights movement in the US. Change isn't immediate but the atrocities perpetrated during the Holocaust and Jim Crowe era South were the beginning of the end of state sanctioned racism. Fredrickson says \"What the Nazis had done was so indefensible that later neo-Nazis would deny that the Holocaust had taken place rather than try to justify it.\" (128).<br /><br />Would I recommend the book? Only if you want an objective, academic look at the history of racism in the Western world. Otherwise, well, just know what you're getting into.<br /><br />Title quote from page 6<br /><br />Fredrickson, George M. Racism: A Short History.

Or any books. But especially the ones that people have said should be banned from schools because that's how you know those are the good ones. I got this list from Bev at <a href=\"http://myreadersblock.blogspot.com/2011/09/banned-books.html\">My Reader's Block</a> who found it on one blog, who got it from another blog and on and on back until it came from a list posted on <a href=\"http://www.heatherpearson.com/2011/09/why-you-should-read-banned-books.html\">Books and Quilts</a> which has a great video about why you should read banned books. <br /><br />This is said to be a list of the top 110 banned books of all times but since I don't actually have the source for that list or claim, I'm going to just say here is a list of (probably) banned books.

His thinking involves writing bestselling novels. Mine involves giving way too much thought to Disney movies. In this case Beauty and the Beast. I don't really know what sparked this. I didn't see anything about it and I can't remember the last time I watched the movie, but apparently my subconscious has been stewing over this for awhile now and wanted to talk through it. And for whatever reason lately my body has decided at 3pm it needs to sleep and when I don't give in to its nap time requests it punishes me by not sleeping at night. So what I'm saying is I'm over-tired, and there's a good chance nothing that follows makes any sense. <img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Belle+Reading.jpg\" /> She's reading. That makes this relevant. For those unfamiliar, here's a quick recap of the prologue to the movie. Or you can just watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGp_wHvaHdM\">this clip</a><br />A young Prince is a selfish jerk. One day an ugly old lady shows up at the castle and asks for someplace to stay for the night, but says the only payment she can offer is a rose. The Prince is all like \"ew gross\" and says no way. The old lady tells him not to be deceived by appearances and please let her stay. Prince-y still says no. So then the old lady turns out to be a beautiful enchantress (because she couldn't really be powerful and ugly. Come on now) and puts a spell on the Prince to make him a beast and turn all of the staff into teapots and whatnot, because fuck the poor servants. That rose that she gave him was magic and was going to stay alive until the Prince's 21st year. If he can find love and be loved in return before the rose dies, he'll turn back into a person. If not he's a Beast forever. Sad for him. Years pass and Beast gets really depressed and loses hope and figures he'll just be a Beast forever and then the movie begins!<br /><br />So here are my problems with this:<br />1. The intro identifies the Beast as a Prince. So that means there's a King and Queen somewhere, right? If there wasn't, Prince would actually be King. Where the hell are his parents? Did they get turned into pots and beds too? And if so, why doesn't anyone mention them?<br /><br />2. If he is a Prince, what does his family rule over? No one seems too concerned that their royal family is suddenly gone one day and there's this power vacuum.<br /><br />3. So maybe we can assume that the guy's name is Prince and he's not actually a prince. Just a really rich guy that makes some pretentious but ultimately catchy tunes. Again, why didn't people in the town notice when he disappeared and suddenly there's this beast thing roaming around? I mean, the town is overly concerned with the fact that Belle reads books. This seems like the type of place where everyone is all up in everyone else's business. You'd think \"crazy rich guy suddenly disappears\" would be big news.<br /><br />4. So the deal is Prince/Beast has to find love by his 21st year. In the song \"Be Our Guest\" Lumiere says \"10 years we've been rusting...\" 10 years. So Prince was roughly 11 when he acted like a douche to the old lady/enchantress. This seems like a really harsh punishment for an 11 year old.<br /><br />Some people spend their time thinking important thoughts and fixing actual problems. I poke holes in the logic of a twenty year old family animated movie.<br /><br />This post is going to be light on actual book connections. Here's your first one.<br /> This is your second book reference and how I'm justifying posting this up here. Also it's my blog so I'll post whatever random thoughts I might have. Especially when I share these thoughts with Boyfriend who reacts by shaking his head and walking out of the room.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:33+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:33+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-23T13:07:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5d5dde2223b6000131","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"I need more sleep","slug":"i-need-more-sleep","url":"/articles/tags/i-need-more-sleep"},{"value":"Beauty and the Beast","slug":"beauty-and-the-beast","url":"/articles/tags/beauty-and-the-beast"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5d5dde226419000605","title":"Top Ten Books Everyone Has Read But Me","slug":"top-ten-books-everyone-has-read-but-me","url":"/articles/top-ten-books-everyone-has-read-but-me","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" />It's Tuesday again which means it's time for another Top Ten, Hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/09/kellys-top-ten-books-i-feel-as-though.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a>. Last week the topic was about blogging peer pressure. This time it's just general book reading peer pressure only this time it's the peer pressure I resisted. Or else it's the books I missed that I should probably fix. Or books that I might get around to reading or might not. Whatever. <br />Books/Authors I'll get to when I'm done with all of the other books1. The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson - I read the first one and after that I was good. No need to keep going with the series. <br />2. Nicholas Sparks or Jodi Picoult - I'm putting these 2 as one entry. Maybe they're completely different and I have no idea what I'm talking about. Maybe I'm really missing out on something and my life is less complete not reading them. It's a risk I'm willing to take while there's so much else out there I want to read first.Update: I may not want to read her, but I should at least spell Picoult's name right. Fixed.<br />Books that I'm \"meh\" about reading3. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins - So many people have read this and so many bloggers talk about it. I'm not actively avoiding it, but I'm certainly not going out of my way for it.<br />4. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini - I read A Thousand Splendid Suns and enjoyed it. Well liked it enough. Clearly not enough to run out and read this one that was on pretty much everyone's reading list for awhile. I wouldn't turn it down if it appeared in front of me and I had nothing else.<br />5. The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger - Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that a few different trusted bloggers have mentioned this as a worthwhile read, this would probably have landed in the first category. Maybe I'll give this a try someday but honestly, every time I look at the summary I think \"hmm there are some other books I'd like to read first...\"<br />6. Nancy Drew by \"Carolyn Keene\" - I put this in this middle category because I'm not against reading them. They seem interesting and the type of thing that most people read when they're young. And I actually had the entire collection growing up, that I got from my grandmother and mom. And yet I still didn't read them. I'm not opposed to them, but apparently even putting them in front of me didn't get me to check them out. <br />Books/authors I haven't read but should remedy7. Lord of the Flies by William Golding - I somehow missed this one in high school. I was in the group that read 1984. But I'd like to read this. And I will get to it. Soon-ish.<br />8. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck - Another one I would have thought I'd get to in high school but I never did. My friend read it in her class so apparently I was just in the wrong class. That and I'd like to have a better memory of Steinbeck because when I think of him I think of Grapes of Wrath which I did read and didn't care for. Although I've been told I should give this one another try. Maybe someday.<br />9. Ernest Hemingway - I've never actually read any Hemingway and I'm a bit ashamed of this. I feel like I should have read him. He's not difficult like a Joyce so I don't really have an excuse. Plus my brother has read him and liked him. My non-reading brother has me beat here. I cannot let him win.<br />10. Julius Ceaser by Shakespeare - This is another one that I'm ashamed I haven't read. I've read a lot of Shakespeare. I've even read ones like Cymbeline. I've read speeches from JC. I even said Et tu, Brute this week coming out of a Mets game. This wasn't actually in reference to anything that happened so much as we were parked near \"A2\" and I noticed they sound the same because I am smart like that.<br />What are your everyone-has-read-this-but-me books?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:33+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:33+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-20T12:40:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5d5dde226419000606","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5e5dde2238670002b4","title":"Then get going.

What's there to add about Kathryn Stockett's The Help that hasn't already been said over and over again? Not much, but that isn't going to stop me. What I will do instead of just a review is discussing the movie versus the book.<br /><br />I wasn't planning on seeing the movie before reading the book. But I'm awful at planning so it worked out that I did. Boyfriend and I wanted to see a movie but couldn't decide between The Help, Our Idiot Brother, and Crazy, Stupid, Loveg so we threw them into a randomizer and The Help won. I thought about suggesting we see something else, so I could read the book first, but I figured this might be my chance to see the movie before it's out of the theaters since we don't go to the movies all that often. Because I'm lazy. Also because movie theaters and the malls around here are where the Long Island stereotypes congregate and there's only so much Axe body spray I can inhale in any given month. <br /><br />First up, for those that haven't read the book or seen the movie, I really liked them both and would absolutely recommend them. It is a touching story about a disgusting time. I want to put this first up because the rest of this post will probably be all kinds of spoiler-y and you may want to skip over it.<br /><br />Spoilers! Dead ahead!<br /> For the most part, the movie and book are the same. Obviously, right? The story is the same and most of the characters are the same. But the devil's in the details and for the most part the book's details are better.<br /><br />Normally I'll like a book better if I've read the book first. Then I already have my idea of what it should look like and the movie either matches that, exceeds it (not usual because I'm very vain and assume what I've come up with is the best) or else fails to live up to it (again, see vain). If I see the movie first, I read the book picturing what the movie showed me, so there's less opportunity to come up with my own version and more likely I'll go with the vision that the director had. So I was surprised to find that I liked the book better than the movie because the movie seemed afraid of becoming too ambiguous so it stayed very safe, very black &amp; white (pun! although I can't tell if the pun is in bad taste. You know, moreso than puns usually are).<br /><br /><a href=\"http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110809/REVIEWS/110809983\">Ebert has a great line in his review</a> about how the story is about the African-American maids but it's \"equally the story of how they empowered a young white woman to write a best-seller about them\". You get that feeling with the movie that Skeeter/Emma Stone is really the main character. Now I love Emma Stone, she's a big part of the reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place, but I went into the movie assuming the maids were the main characters, in particular Aibileen and Minny. I pleasantly surprised when I picked up the book and Skeeter doesn't even show up for awhile. You get to hear the events from first Aibileen's and then Minny's point of view. Skeeter is there too and I like her and I like hearing her voice but it's Aibileen and Minny I want to hear from.<br /><br />I think they made Hilly worse in the movie than the in book. She's a bitch in both, don't get me wrong, but it was Elizabeth that I couldn't stand. Maybe because you spend more time with her, since Aibileen works for her. Or maybe because I'd heard/seen Hilly be so awful that I expected her to be taken further than she was. She behaved exactly as I expected. Or maybe it's because Elizabeth just couldn't form her own ideas and didn't care for her kids as anything other than an accessory, like her silver set. And they do show some kindness in Hilly. Never towards the maids but she at least starts the book having some real affection for Skeeter, and certainly towards her children. You don't see any other side to Hilly in the movie so she ends up being this one-dimensional villain.<br /><br />I liked Skeeter's mom Charlotte in the movie better, in part because she's played by Allison Janney who is all kinds of wonderful, and also because she's both more sympathetic and more powerful (sympowerful?) in the movie. Especially when Hilly comes over to tell on Skeeter for the book she wrote. In both she says a lot of the same things to Hilly: comments on her hair being a mess, on the cold score that's popped up on her lip, etc. But in the book, she hasn't read Help and doesn't seem to have any idea of the book or even that Skeeter and Hilly aren't friends anymore. In the movie however, she knows everything. Again the lines are mostly the same in both book and movie, but in the movie she's this powerful Southern matriarch, slyly telling off Hilly while staying all prim and proper.<br />Spoilers defeated. You're safe now<br /><br />Both Boyfriend and I wanted to see all of these movies. When there's a movie one of us wants to see and the other doesn't there's more negotiating beyond just pick a movie out of a hat. Or we give up and go see it with other people.<br />Like Moneyball. Seriously, baseball AND math? You're killing me, Smalls!<br />Yes I know that's a baseball reference. Baseball movie reference anyway. Did you know \"a can of corn\" is also a baseball term? although a real, non-movie one. I swear some of these sayings are just to mess with people. Also I have a lot of asides stemming off of other asides and this is just getting ridiculous. Lucky for you, you can skip these. If you talk to me in person this is pretty much how the conversation goes.<br /><br />Title quote from location 3087<br /><br />Stockett, Kathyrn. The Help. Berkley, 2010.

I feel like I need to start this off with an apology because I know going into this, I'm going to forget some of the books I've read because of a fellow blogger. And starting off on that high note, onto the list<br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/shouldnt-you-be-home-sitting-sheba\">This Is Where I Leave You</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/what-i-know-about-sitting-shiva\">by Jonathan Tropper</a>, recommended by Greg from <a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/\">The New Dork Review</a> - This is one of the first book blogger recommendations I remember listening to, and I'm glad I did. The book is touching and funny, with just the right amount of sarcasm (a lot. A lot of sarcasm is the right amount). I may have picked up this book on my own. Maybe eventually. But I definitely picked this one up because of Greg's review of this book and a few other Tropper works.<br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/times-goon-right\">A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan</a>, recommended by Greg again, <a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2010/08/visit-from-goon-squad-by-jennifer-egan.html\">The Reading Ape </a>and Brenna from <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2011/06/visit-from-goon-squad-by-jennifer-egan.html\">Literary Musings</a> - This was a collective effort, although it's not like they all knew they were working together to get me to read this. The Pulitzer scared me off but these three calming explained that the book rocks and I need to get over it and just read it. OK, not directly at me but that was the message I got. And I'm glad I did because this was easily one of my favorite books of the year.<br /><br />3. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/being-dependent-on-each-other-to\">Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</a>, recommended by (&amp; won from!) Jennifer from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a> - This one was recommended to me a couple times by college friends but I never actually read it until I a) read Jennifer's review of it and b) won a copy from her. And I'm so glad I did both because it really was a good book and I should probably apologize to my friend for ignoring him<br /><br />4. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/no-one-living-in-dictatorship-has\">Beijing Coma by Ma Jian</a>, recommended by Pete from <a href=\"http://petekarnas.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/tragic-isolation-in-chinese-literature/\">What You Read </a>- When I began the China Rican Reading Challenge, I needed some recommendations on books and lots of people came through with Chinese suggestions (Puerto Rican was another story...) but I ended up going with Pete's suggestion of Beijing Coma which was crazy long and intense and very good. I know this is one I wouldn't have picked up if I didn't trust the recommender's taste.<br /><br />5. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/lacking-adult-coping-skills-i-steal\">The Bedwetter by Sarah Silverman</a>, recommended by (&amp; won from!) Alice from <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Reading Rambo</a> -  So yes, another book I won but that's not the only reason I read it! Or rather, I wouldn't have entered the contest in the first place if I didn't like Alice's review of the book and think \"I need to check this out for myself\". It was a pretty hilarious read that I'm sure I would never have gotten to if she hadn't recommended it.<br /><br />6. Recommendations from Ben of <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> -  I was going to list out separate entries for each book and then realized while that might get me to 10, Ben would kind of take over the list. I didn't realize how often I take his book recommendations until they're listed out, so here they are:<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/i-am-getting-better-at-smiling-when\">Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/goog_315627364\">Gone, Baby, Gone </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/its-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never\">by Dennis Lehane</a> (though Ellen from <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Fat Books &amp; Thin Women</a> gets some credit for this as well)<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/have-you-ever-tried-to-outrun-yourself\">Black Coffee Blues by Henry Rollins</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/there-was-no-after-only-end\">Hogdoggin' by Anthony Neil Smith</a><br /><br />Now there are other bloggers whose recommendations I plan on taking, like <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2011/09/devouring-books-blonde-by-joyce-carol.html\">Devouring Books</a> Laura's recommendation of Joyce Carol Oats's book Blonde but I figured I'd go with the books I've already read instead of the ones I plan on reading but haven't made it that far yet. And of course there are the books like <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/if-room-wasnt-our-home-does-that-mean\">Room </a>and The Help that I'm reading essentially cos everyone else read them and said (mostly) good things about them so I can't give credit to any one person.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:34+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:34+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-13T13:49:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5e5dde2223b6000133","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5e5dde2223b6000134","title":"As if repetition equaled truth, [the story] strengthened until the inventions were known as fact","slug":"as-if-repetition-equaled-truth-the-story-strengthened-until-the-inventions-were-known-as-fact","url":"/articles/as-if-repetition-equaled-truth-the-story-strengthened-until-the-inventions-were-known-as-fact","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Tracks+cover.jpg\" />It's fitting that the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/does-literature-have-to-be-difficult\">most recent Literary Blog Hop</a> asked if literary writing had to be difficult. I just finished Louise Erdrich's Tracks which I could see people considering a \"difficult\" novel, although it's relatively short (only 226 pages) and uses simple language and sentence construction. There are no multi-page descriptions or stream-of-consciousness chapters. And yet this book took me awhile to get through, even though this is my second time reading it.<br /><br />In my answer to the LBH question, I said there is an important distinction between a a difficult book and a challenging book, and that it basically boils down to a challenging book is worth the work you have to put into it while a difficult book it's difficult for the sake of being difficult. Tracks is a challenging book.<br /><br />The book's central character is an Anishinaabe woman named Fleur Pillager, although you never get to know her too well. The book has 2 first person narrators: Nanapush, a village elder and father figure to Fleur  and Pauline Puyat, who I could say something objective about but instead I'll tell you she is crazy. Crazy. Kind of like the albino killer guy from The Da Vinci Code except she's a fully realized character. Fully realized crazy. And it's up to these 2 to tell you about the main character. The fact that you stay removed from Fleur adds to her mystic. She's sexy, she's powerful and she's dangerous, but not in a contemporary-action-hero-Lara-Croft kind of way. There are legends about her circulating throughout the tribe and legends naturally exaggerate the truth so you're never quite sure what she's really capable of. You assume she can't conjure up tornadoes but you can never really be sure. <br /><br />Nanapush and Pauline are each telling their own stories about the past, and they sometimes talk about the same events, although the fact that they're talking about the same thing isn't immediately obvious (challenge!). This also means that you're dealing with not one but two unreliable narrators (challenge!). Nanapush is explaining Fleur's past to her estranged daughter Lulu and Pauline is telling her own story, but she's a wee bit obsessed with Fleur (crazy AND challenge)<br /><br />The book isn't just about the force that is Fleur and her narrators Nanapush and Pauline. The book also deals with several difficult topics, include rape, death, starvation, the loss of the Anishinaabe land as they're pushed onto reservations and lots of other uncomfortable topics. It's not quite a Toni Morrison level of uncomfortable topics, but it's certainly heading in that direction.<br /><br />Tracks is a challenging read, so don't let the short length fool you. But the important thing is it's worth the challenge. Sure, I probably won't be reading this one again for awhile because the challenge means it takes work and overall I'm a lazy person. But when you're up for it, it's worth the effort.<br /><br />Title quote from page 215<br /><br />Erdrich, Louise. Tracks.

Can you think of examples of literary writing that are not difficult?<br /><br />I'm kind of building off of what <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/09/difficulty-challenge-meaning-whatever.html\">Ben </a>said in his response, so you should probably go read that and see a fully thought out answer, but I think an important thing to look at is the difference between \"difficult\" and \"challenging\".  At least in my mind, difficult is hard to read for the sake of being hard to read. It's difficult to show off how difficult it can be and even if you work your way through it, there's no pay off. It wasn't worth it. Challenging, on the other hand, can be hard to get through. But when you work through it, you feel like you've earned something. Toni Morrison's Beloved is this way, as is Louis Erdrich's Tracks (hence the reason I've yet to finish it/post it about it, even though it's a pretty short book).<br /><br />This works the other way too. There are \"easy\" books and then there are \"simple\" books. The Da Vinci code is an easy book. You can get through it but there's no pay off. Orwell's Animal Farm is a simple book. It isn't overly showy or overly flowy but when you finish it you feel full. An easy book is the literary equivalent of empty calories.<br /><br />So no, being literary doesn't mean being difficult. Nor does being difficult mean you're literary.<br /><br />What do you think? Is literary fiction necessarily difficult?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:35+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:35+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-08T22:25:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5f5dde22fdcf00051a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e5f5dde226419000607","title":"Twenty Questions","slug":"twenty-questions","url":"/articles/twenty-questions","body":"I've been skipping the weekly Top Ten Tuesdays because I haven't been able to think of anything for the latest topics. Less than usual, considering I've participated when I could only come up with 3 items before. Laura over at <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/2011/09/twenty-questions.html\">Devouring Texts</a> was also at a loss for this week's topic (sequels you're looking forward to) and instead posted answers to twenty questions. Because I'm all about talking about myself I thought I'd steal her post (don't worry, I asked her about it first) and give my own answers. So here we go<br /><br />1. Which book has been on your shelf the longest?<br />I have a copy of T. H. White's The Once and Future King from the early '50s I took from my grandparents house. I think that fulfills the category both in oldest book as well as book I've carried around with me (thus been on my shelf for awhile) but still have yet to read. <br /><br />2. What is your current read, your last read and your next read?<br />I'm currently re-reading Tracks by Louis Erdrich, my last read was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/its-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never\">Gone, Baby, Gone by Dennis Lehane</a> and my next (tentative) read is The Help by Kathryn Stockett. Although I'm no good at sticking to a reading plan so we'll see what my next book actually ends up being. <br /><br />3. What book did everyone like and you hated?<br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson. Everyone it seems loved this one and couldn't put it or the sequels down. I struggled to make it through this one for book club and never bothered to read the others. <br /><br />4. Which book do you keep telling yourself you'll read, but you probably won't?<br />I don't want to say I probably won't because I like lying to myself, but I have Franzen's The Corrections staring at me, just daring me to read it for almost a year now. I bought it last October coming back from a friend's wedding and I made a promise to myself that I would read it before the end of the calendar year. We'll see if that happens. <br /><br />5. Which book are you saving for your \"retirement\"?<br />That would require a level of planning that is beyond me. I usually pick out my next read on the fly.<br /><br />6. Last page: read it first or save it for the end?<br />I do not understand reading the last page. I would never read the book if I did this. My mom does this, and I am impressed that she can still enjoy the story even if she knows how it goes. She's this way with everything, which is awesome for me because I never have to worry about spoilers when talking to her about movies. <br /><br />7. Author acknowledgements: waste of ink and space or an interesting aside?<br />I usually just skip over reading them, but sometimes I'll skim them to see if they say anything interesting. I used to read the liner notes on CDs to see what bands were thanked and used that to find new music. Authors need to do this in their own acknowledgements section. <br /><br />8. Which book character would you switch places with?<br />Thursday Next from Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series. She's a literary badass and I would love to visit Book World. <br /><br />9. Do you have a book that reminds you of something specific in your life? (a person, a place, a time?)<br />I'm sure there are other books that fit this question and I'm sure I'll think of them after I've already hit \"publish\" but Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code makes me think of my friend's aunt's house in Ireland. I spent just under a month out there with her and her family, and I had brought this book with me. In between seeing the countryside and visiting various bars I remember hanging out in the sitting room reading this book. I think I remember the location better than I remember the book itself. Maybe not the worst thing.  <br /><br />10. Name a book you acquired in some interesting way.<br />The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster. I kinda sorta stole it from my English class when I was in the sixth grade. I'd say \"accidentally\" stole, but that's not really true. I switched classes mid-year and the class I switched into had just begin reading The Phantom Tollbooth, so I had to catch up a bit. Which meant when I was given a copy of the book I apparently didn't put my name on whatever roster everyone else did. At some point the book got caught in my locker and the back cover ripped off. I was upset the book was ripped plus I knew I was going to have to pay for it. But they never asked for my copy of the book back and I never offered it up. Having to pay to replace an $8 book seemed way more dire when I was 11 than it does in retrospect.<br /><br />11. Have you ever given away a book to a special person for a special reason?<br />I wish I had some cute story here, but nope. Update! My (awesome) friend Paul reminded me I gave him an (awesome) Bryson book being being a super (awesome) nerd.<br /><br />12. Which book has been with you to the most places?<br />I guess I'd have to say Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, though not because it's a particular favorite of mine. I brought it with me to Italy when I studied there, and then before coming back to the States I spent a month in Ireland (separate trip from the one above, though with the same friend) so it came there as well. I then carried it with me throughout my various Boston moves and I re-read it at some point so had it with me on the subway. And now it's in Long Island with me.<br /><br />13. Any \"required reading\" you hated in high school that wasn't so bad ten years later?<br />It's hard to say because the books that I really hated in high school I've yet to revisit. I probably should because that list include The Grapes of Wrath and 1984. Maybe I'll re-read those and then can answer this. The Scarlet Letter however, stays on my \"no thank you\" list. I re-read it in college and it was exactly how I remembered it. <br /><br />14. What's the strangest item you've ever found in a book?<br />I suppose this isn't actually that strange but when I recently read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/his-first-reaction-to-unplanned-and\">Stephen King's Dreamcatcher</a> an old birthday card from fell out, along with a newspaper clipping for the Broadway show Kiss Me, Kate, which I saw for my birthday that year. That's apparently when I had been given the book. And then I read it more than 10 years later. Not because I didn't want to it's just such a big book for subway reading.<br /><br />15. Used or brand new?<br />I love new books. I like my books to look like they're in new condition. I know I should make use of a library and save myself some money, but I never do.  <br /><br />16. Stephen King: literary genius or opiate to the masses?<br />This is very black and white. Can't he fall somewhere in the middle? If I have to pick I'd say literary genius, although that might be going a bit far. He's obviously a very popular author but I don't think he gets all the literary credit he deserves.  <br /><br />17. Have you ever seen a movie you liked better than the book?<br />Yes, definitely. I love the Lord of the Rings movies (I have both the theatrical and the extended editions). It was a struggle to make it through the first 2 books and I really tried to make it through Return of the King before I gave up. It wasn't worth it. American Psycho is another movie I like more than the book. Because the movie doesn't make me physically gag. <br /><br />18. Conversely, which book should NEVER have been introduced to celluloid?<br />Never say never. There are some stories that have had really unsuccessful movie adaptations (Pet Semetary) but that doesn't mean that there is no hope of the book working on the screen. However, I can't see how the Thursday Next series would ever work although if someone were to attempt it, I'd probably see it. All this being said, I have been avoiding the movie <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/07/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor.html\">14/a>, because I loved the short story so much I assume the movie cannot live up to it and I don't want the short story ruined for me. That's not to say it shouldn't have been put on the screen, and maybe it is a really good movieust don't want to find out that it's not and have images from the movie supersede what's in my head. <br /><br />19. Have you ever read a book that made you hungry, excluding cookbooks?<br />Julie and Julia by Julie Powell. She's cooking a bunch of Julia Child recipes, which sound delicious and she's cursing throughout which made me smile. <br /><br />20. Who is the person whose book advice you always take? <br />Well I don't always listen to anyone because I'm stubborn like that, but there are a few book recommenders I listen to more often than not. My friends Paul and Matt always seem to recommend books that end up being favorites of mine. In the blogging world there are a number of recommendations I seriously consider. Here's a short list:<br />Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a><br />Brenna from <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musings</a><br />Jennifer from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a><br />Greg from <a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/\">The New Dork Review</a><br />Laura from <a href=\"http://devouringtexts.blogspot.com/\">Devouring Texts</a><br />Alice from <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Reading Rambo</a><br />Ellen from <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Fat Books &amp; Thin Women</a><br />I could probably go on and on (and on) with this list but I'll stop here.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:35+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:35+00:00","published_at":"2011-09-07T15:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e5f5dde226419000608","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e605dde2223b6000136","title":"It's a nasty world out there, and it's never been nice to children","slug":"its-a-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never-been-nice-to-children","url":"/articles/its-a-nasty-world-out-there-and-its-never-been-nice-to-children","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Gone+Baby+Gone+cover.jpg\" />I had only read one Dennish Lehane book, Mystic River, and that I had read for a class. I wasn't avoiding the guy, I just wasn't going after him either. But both Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> and Ellen from <a href=\"http://fatbooks.org/\">Fat Books &amp; Thin Women</a> are fans and they each have excellent taste in books, so when I saw a copy of Gone, Baby, Gone sitting on one of the sale tables at my favorite bookstore, The Brookline Booksmith, I decided now was the time to expand my Lehane horizons.<br /><br />Gone, Baby, Gone is part of the Kenzie/Gennaro series, about two private detectives in the Boston area. It's not the first in their series but it's the first I've read. There are references to past cases that I'm sure are covered in other books (books I plan on checking out) so I suppose I'll find out eventually how important it would have been to read those first. Kenzie and Gennaro reluctantly take a missing child case, after pressed by the girl's aunt. Lehane does not pussy foot around difficult topics and this missing child case puts the PI against drug dealers, rapists, pedophiles and a whole host of other unsavory characters. Especially Helene, Amanda's (missing child) mom. She is both the best and the worst character. One of the most interesting characters to read and the one you most want to stab repeatedly for being so selfish. Amanda was abducted in the middle of the night while her mother left her alone with the door unlocked. She's mostly upset that Amanda missing has messed up her life instead of being terrified for her daughter's well-being. There's a reason it was Amanda's aunt that sought out the help of Kenzie and Gennaro.<br /><br />I love reading stories when I'm familiar with the location and Gone, Baby, Gone takes place around the Boston area. I didn't spend huge amounts of time in Dorchester and of course Lehane says in the beginning that he changed the geography to suit the stories needs, but there are references to real places and just having a picture of where the Victoria diner or what the South Bay shopping center looks like makes me happy. It's one of the reasons I liked watching The Sopranos so muchg. Now granted, Lehane's Boston is much darker and dirtier and more dangerous than I remember actual Boston ever being, but of course if it was cleaner or we ran into more college kids it wouldn't have been the same dark story. Although now I'm picturing the story filled with the bros that lurk around the various campuses in and around Boston and it's making me laugh. <br /><br />I did have one big problem with the book, but that problem was my fault. Gone, Baby, Gone is a mystery as you try to figure out what happened to Amanda and who could have taken her and how do these drug dealers fit into the equation. This means that trying to untangle the plot and guess what the answer could be is part of the fun. And I already saw the movie. I thought maybe this wouldn't be too much of a problem because I don't remember too many details. But I remember the last few scenes. So the whole time I was reading the book, even though I couldn't quite remember how we get to that point, I already knew what the outcome was going to be. This meant there was less suspense for me. Less than I knew there would be anyway, if I had no idea how things were going to turn out. However, this fact could also be a positive for the book, since knowing the ending didn't actually ruin the book. It's still an intriguing story and the characters make it worth it, even when you already know how it turns out.<br /><br />I do plan on reading some more of the Kenzi/Gennaro series. I already have Darkness, Take My Hand selected as my next one, care of Ellen and Ben. I'm not sure exactly when I'll get to it, but I promise it won't be the same 6 year gap between Lehane reads.<br /><br />I'm originally from north Jersey.<br />The movie's actually very good, though I would recommend checking it out after reading this If you're planning on picking this up that is. Otherwise just see the movie. There's a chance I liked Helene so much because I loved Amy Ryan's performance of her.<br /><br />Title quote from page 65<br /><br />Lehane, Dennis. Gone, Baby, Gone.

Before I get into the stats I wanted to a) direct you over to another awesome blog post and b) write my own two-cents about the topic.<br /><br />Greg over at <a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/2011/08/president-obama-read-whatever-you-want.html\">The New Dork Review </a>wrote a post responding to an op-ed piece written by Robin Black. Black is angry at President Obama for not reading enough female authors. There's some ranting and raving and the tone  suggests that if Obama and other men would just read some lady authors then there would be no more war or AIDS or having to wake up early when all you want to do is sleep. As I said, Greg wrote a great post responding to this and he sums it up nicely: We read for fun, not to be fair. This is true and content is king. Please keep that in mind for the next paragraph: content is king.<br />However, I clearly think there is some importance to the author's gender, race, nationality, etc or I would track all that stuff. It is important to break out of your literary comfort zone and read without a safety net. If all you ever read are male authors, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to read something by a woman. Now, very importantly, this doesn't mean read just anything. Because to suggest reading any book by a woman author implies that they're all the same. Since I'm not a hack comedian from the early '90s, I'm not going to tell you \"women write like this\" and \"men write like this\". Writers are naturally going to bring their own experiences to their writing. Whether you believe that men and women are from different planets or that men and women are exactly the same and any differences are just a societal construct, the fact is being different means they are going to have different experiences and thus bring a different point of view to their writing. This isn't just for the author's gender, but also race, religion, ethnicity, anything. This doesn't mean you have to have a perfectly balanced cross-section of authors. All you have to do is decide for yourself what's your comfort zone and what's outside of it. But above everything else, read what's good regardless of who wrote it. Content. Is.

I think it was mostly out of spite for being made to do it during gym class. I told a teacher at I would run if I was being chased but didn't see the point in just going around in circles. I played a decent amount of sports when I was younger, but I seemed to find the positions that didn't require a lot of running. I was a pitcher for softball and a goalie for soccer. So it's come as a surprise to myself and those that know me that I want to start running. As soon as I'm not being made to do something, I have no problem doing it. Because I'm a brat.<br /><br />While I may want to start running, I still need some sort of motivation. I figured I'd just load the iPod up with some music and go with that. When I used to have access to treadmills (one of the many things I miss about college was free gym access) I would read while running. I got a lot of homework done that way. However, seeing how I no longer have free access to a treadmill (I'm too cheap to pay for a gym membership) it seemed that reading and running will no longer be an option. But then, Jennifer from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a> mentioned she runs to audiobooks. She said it helps keep her motivated to run until she finishes a chapter. Sounds like a genius idea to me!

All of Moore's humor and quirkiness are there but the story itself is rough. Rough as in \"could be improved upon to make a more polished finished product\" and not \"deals with difficult topics\".<br /><br />Practical Demonkeeping tells the story of Travis who accidentally said an incantation to call up the demon Catch. Travis is supposedly Catch's master but controlling a hell demon is a lot of work. Travis and Catch travel to the little town of Pine Cove which is filled with the typical off-beat collection of Moore characters, \"winos, neo-pagans and deadbeat Lotharios\" as the back cover describes. The Pine Cove-ians have to work together with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn\">djinn </a>(genie) Gian Hen Gian to send Catch back to hell, given his propensity for eating people. Those of you who are Moore fans may remember Catch from his appearance in my favorite Moore book (and favorite book overall) Lamb, and officer Alphonse Rivera from the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/it-was-as-if-vampirism-carried-with-it\">Bloodsucking</a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/you-shouldnt-just-kill-guy-without\"> Fiends</a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/saying-rawr-is-not-vampyre-thing\"> books</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/for-guy-that-maintains-low-profile\">Coyote </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/you-cant-just-go-around-breaking\">Blue</a>. A few of the other characters and the locations show up elsewhere, but I haven't read those yet.<br /><br />This has all of the makings of a typical Moore offering and yet it fell short for me. There are great moments, the characters are colorful but not caricatures (at least not all of them) and the plot is unique and funny, but I felt like I was reading something that was unfinished. Maybe it only felt unfinished because I've read other Moore and I know what he can do. It's interesting to see how he's grown as an author, but I'm glad this wasn't the first book of his that I read because I don't know that I would have gone for his others.<br /><br />If you like Moore and you've read all his other stuff, check this out. If you haven't read him before, start with Lamb or <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/were-all-fates-bastards\">Fool </a>or A Dirty Job first.<br /><br />Title quote from page 43<br /><br />Moore, Christopher.

Having read more books means you have more in your arsenal to pick from and those listening to your recommendation know that you've seen a lot and can pick out the good from the bad. And yet I keep taking book recommendations from my brother who is very much a non-reader. There is some logic here so hear me out. My brother doesn't often read. There are other things he'd rather spend his free time doing, so when he tells me he has a book I should check out I listen. Because this was a book that caught his attention before he wandered back to his usual pastime.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Tokyo+Vice+cover.jpg\" />Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan by Jake Adelstein is not something I would have picked up on my own. It's a memoir (eh) about a crime reporter (alright) in Japan (I'm listening). Now my brother may have gotten me to pick up the book in the first place but the opening grabbed me. Jake is being told by a yakuza enforcer \"Either erase the story, or we'll erase you. And maybe your family. But we'll do them first, so you learn your lesson before you die.\" We're on page one and Mr. Adelstein is already in a world of trouble. Adelstein then jumps back and tells how he first became a reporter at the Yomiuri Shinbun. The first two thirds of the book introduces you to the world of crime reporting in Japan and feels like individual episodes as he discusses the different crimes he covered. And I know this is positioned as a memoir and I can't say I have any real reason to disbelieve any encounter, but there were definitely points that it felt like Adelstein wasn't going to let the truth get in the way of a good story. Or perhaps it's just his talent as a writer because there were scenes I could picture as a movie. I could see the lighting, the angles, the music, without having anything spelled out.<br /><br />Weaved within these early reporting exploits are explanations of Japanese culture. If you can't tell by his name, Jake Adelstein is not a native of Japan. He's Jewish-American and constantly teased, sometimes in jest, sometimes not, about being a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaijin\">gaijin</a>, a non-Japanese. Sometimes this works to his advantage as he gathers information. He talks about Japan with a real respect for his adopted home without ever glossing over the uglier parts. And by working the vice and organized crime beats, eventually investigating human trafficking, he's certainly seen his share of the darker side of Japan.<br /><br />For the first two thirds I couldn't put the book down. It's hard to say exactly what it is, but it had a quality that drew me in and had me thinking about it even when I wasn't reading. By the time he starts investigating human trafficking and as we get to the investigation that lead to a price on his head, the storytelling felt like it was taking a back seat to facts. I was no longer framing scenes for a movie, I no longer thought things seemed too good to be real. Things were slowly building from the start of the book to that yakuza meeting and then all of a sudden we were past that point and I had whiplash trying to figure out how we went by it so fast. The yakuza crime boss Goto didn't want Jake to write the story that ended up becoming Tokyo Vice. It was such a key moment and we sped right by the build up to him finding the story, Goto threatening him, and then his investigation where he finds out what the real story is that Goto was trying to keep quiet. The end of the book is still interesting but it didn't grab me like the beginning did. Which makes no sense because you'd think having the yakuza after him to keep him silent while he tries to hurry and write this story as a kind of insurance policy would be the more interesting part.<br /><br />I could see this eventually being made into a movie. Or a mini-series. It's has an interesting story with characters you care about, that lost momentum right when it should have been gaining it. Overall I liked the book and I'm very glad I read it. Especially because it's something I would have passed over on my own. It's too bad Adelstein isn't a a fiction writer. I'd read some of his fiction if he ever decides to write it.<br /><br />Update! My brother sent me a video of an interview Jake Adelstein did on The Daily Show. I feel he gives a bit of the ending away, but then again, it's not supposed to be a twist ending so I suppose it doesn't matter.<br /><a href=\"http://vodpod.com/watch/2523327-tokyo-vice-author\" target=\"_blank\">http://vodpod.com/watch/<wbr></wbr>2523327-tokyo-vice-author</a><br /><br />Title quote from page 47<br /><br />Adelstein, Jake.

I can't remember when I started reading them, but according to Gmail I signed up for his weekly emailsg in May of 2006. I know it was sometime back in high school I started reading his reviews because that's when I first heard about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB</a>. I would look up movies I had seen, go through the trivia and check out the external reviews. Ebert's were usually at the top of the list. I like his reviewing style. I wish I could review like him. So when Amazon was running a special sale on a number of their Kindle books and Ebert's Your Movie Sucks was on the list for just $1.99, I went for it. Actually it was a friend that told me about the sale and the book, because my love is not really a secret.<br /><br />Your Movie Sucks, like his earlier book I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie, is a collection of reviews about the worst movies he saw. I haven't read Hated, Hated but from what I can tell You Suck covers the awful movies that came out since Hated, Hated was published. His positive reviews are good, but he can really let loose when the movie is awful. While I may like reading these reviews, I only read them under a couple circumstances: I don't plan on seeing the movie, I've already seen the movie. I know, it doesn't seem like I'm really getting anything out of the review that way. I'm clearly doing this wrong. But I don't want my experience with the movie to be too tainted by someone else's opinion. So I'll look at his star rating, I'll read the first paragraph, but otherwise I don't want to see the details of why he hated or loved something, for fear I'll spend the movie looking for those items instead of deciding for myself. Luckily the movies in the book fall into those two categories (I've seen or I won't see), so I could just enjoy his exuberance in describing exactly how bad these movies are.<br /><br />The title of the book was inspired by the movie Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. A reviewer named Patrick Goldstein wrote a negative review of DB:EG. Can you believe it? Because apparently Rob Schneider couldn't and he took out full-page ads in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter attacking Goldstein for his (fairly tame) review, threatening to beat him up and claiming that his lack of awards especially his lack of a Pulitzer Prize means he shouldn't be reviewing movies. Ebert responded to Schnieder's ad: \"As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.\" (location 216).<br /><br />Ebert has a talent for some scathing one-liners and they are arguably the best part of the book, so I figured I'd share a few of them with you:<br /><blockquote>Battlefield Earth is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. </blockquote><blockquote>The movie [Bride of the Wind] has three tones: overwrought, boring, laughable.  </blockquote><blockquote>Charlie's Angels is eye candy for the blind.</blockquote>I liked his reviews even when I didn't agree with them. I happen to like Wet Hot American Summer but I appreciate the fact that he wrote his review as a song. If you're not really a fan of Ebert, I wouldn't bother with the book. All of the reviews are online so you can get to them without buying this. However, if you are a fan, the book is entertaining and puts some of his best reviews about the worst movies all in one place.<br /><br />The emails include the opening paragraph from 3 reviews for current movies and links to the full story. And for whatever reason IMDB has been falling down on getting the links up to his reviews so for the last year or so I usually go through my email to find the review.<br /><br />Goldstein has a few awards. I guess you can't be too surprised Rob Schneider didn't check that first. <br /><br />Title quote from Location 4610, referring to the movie Romeo Must Die.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:38+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:38+00:00","published_at":"2011-08-18T13:20:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e625dde2223b600013d","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Roger Ebert","slug":"roger-ebert","url":"/articles/tags/roger-ebert"},{"value":"Your Movie Sucks","slug":"your-movie-sucks","url":"/articles/tags/your-movie-sucks"}]}]},{"id":"53224e625dde2223b600013e","title":"Top 10 Favorite Childhood Books","slug":"top-10-favorite-childhood-books","url":"/articles/top-10-favorite-childhood-books","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" />It's Tuesday again so here I am with another Top Ten Tuesday, hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/08/top-ten-tuesday-freebie-week.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>. This week they're letting us pick whatever top ten list we want. I wish I was clever enough to think up not only an interesting but that I can actually come up with items for the list. So instead of coming up with my own, I'll use an old topic The B&amp;B came up with that I never did. So here are my top 10 Favorite Childhood books<br /><br />1. The Golden Book of Sharks and Whales by Kathleen Daly, illustrated by James Spence - This was my absolute favorite book when I was little. I can still quote the second page of the book. I don't know why I can quote that one and not the first page, but whatever. The shark section was always my favorite, though oddly enough I'm now terrified of sharks. Oh fear, you won't be swayed by logic will you?<br /><br />2. Matilda by Roald Dahl - Roald Dahl was one of my favorite authors growing up and this was one of my favorite books. Little girl who is super smart and loves to read gets even with her rotten family and then the evil headmistress. I wished I could control things with my mind. Come to think of it, I still do. Any time I'm on one side of the room and my phone/remote/whatever is on the other.<br /><br />3. Sideways Stories from Wayside School by Louis Sacher - I loved this book and read lots of Sacher's stuff because I loved this one so much. It was a kooky story about a bunch of strange kids in a weird school. One girl contemplated selling her toes to the recess monitor because she wasn't using them, a boy who actually turned out to be a dead rat and the girl who brought in a hobo for show and tell. Like I said, it's strange kids at a weird school and I loved it. Now I need to raid my mom's house to see if I can find my copy of it.<br /><br />4. The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster - I don't care if the pun is the lowest form of humor, I love it and this book makes liberal use of them. Milo travels through a mysterious tollbooth to the magical Kingdom of Wisdom, where he has to help rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason and show King Azaz the Unabridged, ruler of Dictionopolis and the Mathemagician, ruler of Digitopolis, that both letters and numbers are equally important. It's a great fantasy adventure story and now I want to find my copy of that book. <br /><br />5. Dr. Seuss - I'm just going to list out the guy instead of any one of his books, because there's no way I could choose just one. I still love Dr. Seuss's books. They're simple, colorful stories that deal with larger issues than most children's books touch on. I mean The Butter Battle Book is about an arms race between neighboring villages, that could possibly end in the destruction of everyone. And of course that distinctive artwork.<br /><br />6. D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Mythology by Ingrid d'Aulaire and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire - My dad got me this book when I was little. Greek myths told in a simple but not dumbed down way, and with lots of illustrations. It was a great introduction to the Greek myths. My dad said you have to know Greek myths and the Bible if you want to understand English language literature so he was getting me started early.<br /><br />7. Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by Robert C. O'Brien - OK, in this case the movie by Don Bluth and the Disney Defectors, came before the book for me. But I still loved this book when I finally got around to reading it. Medical experiences, super smart rats and a dark secret. The stuff children's books are made of.<br /><br />8. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark by Alvin Schwartz, illustrations by Stephen Gammell - Speaking of stuff for children, this book used to scare the hell out of me as a kid. But I still loved it. And it probably fueled my current love for urban legends and modern folklore. I have to give those illustrations a lot of credit for the fear. I bought a new set of those books when I was in college and those pictures are still terrifying. I just saw a new version of the books with illustrations by someone else and really, you're not getting the full experience if you're not getting Gammell's drawings.<br /><br />9. Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein - I had a couple other of Silverstein's poetry books, but this one was my first and my favorite. There are so many poems in there I can still recite. They were children's poetry that didn't condescend to children. \"If you are a dreamer, come in...\"<br /><br />10. Encyclopedia Brown by Donald J. Sobol - Looking back on it now, Brown could be pretty insufferable and smug but I loved trying to solve the case before checking on the answer. As smug as he was, he figured out the answer.<br /><br />I'd like to add one more to the list but I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the book. I know, doesn't really make a strong case for a \"childhood favorite\" but I was never good with details. I did used to take it out of the library roughly a gazillion times and I remember making a diorama of it for a class. It was about a giant chicken that terrorized this village. Eventually they figure out how to defeat the chicken and presumably no one goes hungry anymore because they have giant chicken to eat. OK, so I can't remember the details, but I do remember that diorama and the fact that the images weren't super cartoony. Not realistic but more detailed than you'd expect for a kid's book. And I don't really remember learning a lesson other than giant chickens are terrifying and you should probably destroy it. So if anyone knows the name of that I will be your best-est friend if you share that title with me.<br /><br />Look at that I made it all the way to 10! 10 1/2 even!<br /><br />What are some of your favorite childhood books?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:38+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:38+00:00","published_at":"2011-08-16T13:04:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e625dde2223b600013f","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e625dde2223b6000140","title":"[There] was no after.

He described it as \"very visceral crime fiction\". I can't say I've read a lot of crime fiction but it sounded good and I trust a recommendation from him. Plus free!<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Hogdoggin+cover.jpg\" />Anthony Neil Smith's Hogdoggin' is the follow up to his book Yellow Medicine, which I've not yet read. However, I didn't actually realize this was a sequel until I started looking at reviews on Goodreads after I finished reading the bookg so I can first say the book works without having read Yellow Medicine. Maybe I missed details or connections that would have been obvious had I read the first book but no matter. I was entertained anyway. \"Hogdoggin'\" is described as \"a new backwoods sport in which Pit Bulls or Rotts were put into a pen with a mostly helpless hog. The dog would rip into the pig, and all the people had themselves a grand time watching the carnage\" (location 883). The story follows a number of characters, with the point of view changing multiple times in each chapter. We primarily follow Bill Lafitte, former cop turned enforcer for a biker gang as he's called back to his old life and Franklin Rome, the ex-FBI agent that has been officially taken off the case and has made hunting down Lafitte his vigilante mission.<br /><br />The book is violent. Smith lays it on you right away as we watch Steel God, the leader of the biker gang, deal with a member of his gang that's been ratting on him. It's not pretty. I'm certain I was pulling some ridiculous faces while I read this scene while trying to to picture it in too much detail. The violence isn't gratuitous. There's a lot of it but it serves the story. You even see why the various characters commit the violence they do, whether or not it was necessary. Some use violence as a last resort, some as that first handshake, but they all use it. With every page things go from bad to worse and each time you think that's it, things have to start getting better for these guys, the bottom falls out and things become even more hopeless.<br /><br />My favorite character was Steel God, which probably doesn't say very positive things about me. He's one of those violence-as-a-handshake guys, the one who has no problem using violence. Normally I'm not a fan of violent characters, unless the violence couldn't be avoided. If that was all Smith did with Steel God there wouldn't be much to like about the guy. But if that's all Smith did the book overall wouldn't have been worth it. He's a smart guy and an excellent judge of character, especially those of the criminal bent. I didn't think much about the character at first until he was gone. As soon as he wasn't there I was disappointed I'd be following around these other non-Steel God characters.<br /><br />As much as I like Steel God, Smith failed a bit for me with the female characters. They didn't quite work for me. They were close to being fully realized. He came so close but just didn't push the females past caricatures. All of the women have this Lady Macbeth vibe, manipulating the men in the life to get to the top. All of them. Except Lady Macbeth had more depth.<br /><blockquote>\"[McKeown] could tell that Colleen was back there pulling the strings, feeding Nate questions, pushing her man to be more aggressive in dealing with the Feds. Good woman to have behind you, if you could stand it.\"</blockquote>You could replace \"Colleen\" with almost any of the other female characters and change \"Nate\" to whatever guy they were near and it would still work. Even when you're getting a chapter from the woman's point of view I still don't know the why behind their actions.<br /><br />To end this on a high note, I loved the ending. Loved it. However there might be some spoilers so here's your warning.<br />When I read the last line and realized that was it, there was no more, I laughed. Smith ends the book when tensions are so high you have to laugh or scream or something to release all of that energy. I laughed, thought \"Smith, you asshole,\" and shook my head in admiration. Because the ending just...happened. And the thing is, it worked.<br />Spoilers over<br /><br />I tend to read reviews after I've read something. Or at least if I already plan on reading something. I want to go in without any preconceived notions. Or at least as few as I can get away with.<br /><br />Title quote from location 1552<br /><br />Neil Smith, Anthony. Hogdoggin'.

Nor do I mean you read in some review a celebrity mentions reading something and you take that as a recommendation. I mean, have you ever seen an actor in the trailer for some movie based on a book and decided to read the book because that actor is amazing, ergo book must be good? Yeah me neither, but I have seriously considered it. Most recently with Water for Elephants.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Christoph+Waltz+Inglorious.jpg\" />Can this sell books?It was hard not to see this book on stands and in various commuters hands. It is immensely popular. But I never had any interest in it. Almost inevitably with a popular piece of work, it was made into a movie.  I still didn't think too much of it but figured I could find out what the book was about (because picking up the book and reading the back cover was way too much work). Then I saw Christoph Waltz is in it and while I can't say I'm familiar with his full catologue of work (because it's mostly in German), he kicked so much ass in Inglourious Bastardsg that he's earned a lot of goodwill in my book. Enough that I considered reading the book. A book that previously I had no interest in. All because I liked him so much as a crazy Nazi in an entirely different movie.<br /><br />Thus far I have yet to read Water for Elephants and with reviews like this one from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/2011/07/water-for-elephants.html\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a>, I can't say I'm rushing to get a copy of it.

I was gone for a few of them and then I just couldn't get back into the swing of things. As past top 10 posts have shown, I clearly don't feel the need to actually hit 10 examples for these lists yet the last few I couldn't even come up with enough to satisfy my low standards. Well this week I'm coming back. I make no promises that I'll hit 10, but I'm here dammit. So here we go! Top 10 Underrated books hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/08/ready-top-ten-underrated-books.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a>:<br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde</a> - Oh, I'm sorry. Did you think this list was going to suddenly be original and not contain a book I mentioned for nearly every list? Thanks, that was sweet of you. While I mention this ad nauseum, I do think it's underrated and I want more people to pick it up. At least enough so that the Brookline Booksmith starts to regularly carry Fforde's stuff instead of me finding a book on their remainders table.<br /><br />2. Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite by June Casagrande - I found this book on one of those remainder tables, so clearly it's not getting the love it deserves. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/summary-with-multiple-tenses-is-like\">I recently wrote about another grammar book</a>, so the topic is fresh in my mind and if you want a witty way to learn about language, go with this one. And seriously, grammar for spite? Yes, please.<br /><br />3. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-think-you-showed-lot-of-heart-lot-of\">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)</a> by The Reduced Shakespeare Company - One of my favorite plays that I have read again and again (and again). It's Shakespeare but cut down to just get to the good parts. My short attention span loves this. It's fun, it's silly and I watched it in a high school Shakespeare class, so it also counts as educational. I have a copy of this being performed on tape but both my VHS and VCR are kaput so I should really consider upgrading to a DVD.<br /><br />4. The Umbrella Man and Other Stories by Roald Dahl - Lots of people know Dahl's children's stories. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG. But Dahl wrote stories for adults as well, and they're wonderful. They have the feel of Dahl's children's stories without the childishness. They're quirky, they're sinister, they're sly, and they're worth checking out.<br /><br />5. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/boston-book-festival-full-frontal\">Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters by Jessica Valenti</a> - This is an excellent book that really deserves more attention. Consider it an intro to modern feminism that deals with where feminism has come from and where it's heading.  It's a good book to learn more about a topic that is so stupidly stigmatized. <br /><br />I made it to 5, so I'm pretty happy.

I am way more insecure of my grammar skills than I let on. I managed to do fairly well on grammar tests throughout school but I swear it was dumb luck. Even now I seem to be able to pick out the object of a sentence without being entirely confident I could defend my choice. I like grammar though and I think it is important to know so I try to make an effort to understand it. To keep me educated and entertained I pick up quirky grammar books. So when a co-worker sent me a link to the book The Elements of Fgcking Style with a note \"You must read this! It was fucking written for you!\" I got excited. Grammar AND cursing? How could things go wrong?<br /><br />It's an interesting idea: explain the rules of grammar using examples that incorporate sex, drugs and cursing. You know, make it accessible to the kids. It's certainly easier to remember grammar rules when the examples are ridiculous. My AIDS test, you'll be happy to know, came back negative is a good way to remember parenthetical comma usage. I liked this. The more ridiculous the sentence the better.<br /><br />Overall though I was disappointed. Sure they have these crazy examples, but after awhile the examples and the explanations just feels like they're trying to be shocking. When every example is trying to be shocking it starts to feel like, as a fellow reader on <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/189628175\">Goodreads</a> noted, a couple pretentious teenage boys wrote it. They're snarky and they understand grammar but they also think any mention of bongs or pussy is automatically hilarious. The information may be accurate, but the writing isn't enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />It's kind of OK there wasn't a lot to keep me interested though because this book is short. I bought it as an ebook so while I knew it was short (only 96 pages) I didn't get a chance to flip through it as I might have with a physical book. If I had I would have noticed that it's actually 1/2 that length. I was 46% of the way through the book (thank you Kindle counter) when I read the following sentence: \"Holy shit, you made it to the end of a book about fucking grammar.\" I read that sentence a couple times before saying, \"No I didn't. I made it 46% of the way through a book about fucking grammar.\"  I literally said this out loud. Boyfriend looked at me with a confused look, and I brought the book over to have him look and make sure I wasn't going crazy. But no, 46% and I'm on the final chapter. I thought the ebook must have some formatting problems. Nope. 46% = end of book. The rest of the book is made up of \"Words Your Bound to Fuck Up\" and \"Glossary of Terms You Don't Understand\". Helpful guides, sure, but disappointing.<br /><br />If you're looking to get a grammar book for someone who will only crack a book open if it contains drugs, sex and cursing, this book is fine. It gets you the grammar rules and will probably keep some people interested in a topic that would otherwise be ignored. However, I'm going to stick with my favorite quirky grammar book, Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies. They both want to make grammar accessible to those who would otherwise never open a grammar book. Grammar Snobs just succeeds where Fcking Style fell down.<br /><br />Title quote from location 762<br /><br />Baker, Chris and Jacob Hansen. The Elements of Fcking Style.

This time it was Sarah Silverman's The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee and I won it from the always awesome Alice from <a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/\">Reading Rambo</a>. How do I keep winning all of these? Simple: 1) Enter giveaway 2) No one else enters 3) WIN! I like to think that it's my awesomeness keeping other people away because the blogs hosting the giveaways rule, so it's certainly not them.<br /><br />I'm a medium fan of Silverman. I think her stand up is funny, but I don't go out of my way to see it. (And by that I mean just on TV or something. Not actually going to see her in person. If I'm too lazy to flip the channel, don't you think I'm too lazy to get up and pay to see her somewhere.) I've seen her show a couple times, I remember something about a queefing ghost, but I don't normally watch it. So this book is in the category of \"if the book falls into my outstretched arms I'll read it, but otherwise I won't bother\". Luckily it did fall into my outstretched arms, in a matter of speaking, and I enjoyed this far more than I had anticipated.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://reading-rambo.blogspot.com/2011/07/where-i-kind-of-defend-sarah-silverman.html\">Alice pointed this out in her own review</a>, but the book is a lot more depressing than you'd think a comedienne's memoir would be. It's still funny, especially the chapter titles, but she talks about some tough issues, especially her teenage depression and that she was prescribed around 16 Xanax per day. And the \"bedwetter\" isn't part of the title just as a joke. She actually had a problem with this through her teenage years and she covers this with both humor (as to be expected) as well as the fear, anxiety and shame this very realistically brought. She slept over at a friend's house and spent the night so terrified she wet the bed that she tried to stay up all night, which resulted in her falling into a super deep sleep and, inevitably, wetting the bed.<br /><blockquote>\"WHO DID THIS!?!?! [the friend's mother] screams, with a look so scary -- like when someone's eyes go wide but with no innocence in them. Just pure fury.<br />I stand there, quietly enduring the world's youngest heart attack, wishing for my fear to somehow transport me. Am I supposed to answer? Is the onus actually on a six-year-old to fill this silence?</blockquote>Lest you think this book is just a pity party, she tempers any sad parts with humor (Seriously, of course there's humor. Quit making me repeat this.) and humility. She knows people out there have had it way worse and points out that things might have been hard for her plenty of people have it way worse.<br /><br />I'm clearly harping on the fact that this book is funny but I want to make sure it's clear that her humor isn't for everyone. I think she's funny. I think her chapter titles like \"Summer Camp: The Second Worst Kind of Camp for Jews\" are funny. I think the joke she tells that gets her into all kinds of trouble with the Media Action Network for Asian Americans is funny and I think that Guy Aoki totally missed the point of the joke. But I acknowledge not everyone is going to like that. Her humor is offensive, though I think she does a good job of pointing out it's not hateful. But you want to know if this book's humor isn't for you? Here's one of her videos called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgHHX9R4Qtk\">The Great Schlep</a>. This is pretty tame so know if this offends you, you should avoid the book. She also has a kick ass video about selling the Vatican to feed the world that got her a good amount of hate mail but Alice already embedded that in her post so I won't copy her. <br /><br /><object><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AgHHX9R4Qtk?version=3\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/AgHHX9R4Qtk?version=3\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\"></object><br /><br />Title quote from page 103<br /><br />Silverman, Sarah.

I wrote a post earlier in the year <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/book-stores-are-going-away\">when Borders filed for Chapter 11</a> wondering what affect this would have on other brick and mortar bookstores, but after that I don't have too much more to say about the company. Honestly, I'm not loyal to a particular bookstore, especially one of the big box stores. Growing up through college I used to go to Barnes &amp; Noble because  that was the bookstore that was closest. Eventually I went to Borders  more often because there was one near my office. The experience and the products are identical, so I went to whichever store was closer and I had a coupon for. Until I got my Kindle I hardly bought books from Amazon, because I'm impatient and wouldn't want to wait for the mailman to bring me my book. Even now, the decision to buy a real book vs. a Kindle book is based on price and how much I want the book on my shelves. I had been planning on buying A Visit from the Goon Squad on my Kindle, till I saw it at Costco for a dollar less. Now it's sitting on my shelf. So clearly my loyalty is to being cheap and lazy over a particular national bookstore brand.<br /><br />I can't say I've been loyal to independent bookstores either. I'll choose them over going to a big box store, provided I don't have to go out of my way to get to it, but I won't choose one indie bookstore over another. I loved <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/boston-valentine\">Brookline Booksmith</a>, especially when I lived down the street from them, but I wouldn't forgo picking up a book from Brattle in favor of them. I prefer the indie stores, especially for browsing and getting recommendations, but I still went to the big box stores, even when I lived near the Booksmith. As I said, Borders used to be near my office and I had no qualms stopping there at lunch to pick up something, especially if I had a coupon. <br /><br />I recently visited both a big box and an indie store: Borders to pick over the remains and see if I could score some good deals (I couldn't really) and Booksmith because I was back in Boston and couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit. Right there illustrates the difference between these 2 book buying experience: I'll go to the big stores for the prices (sometimes) and the little ones for the experience. I was actually also recently at a Barnes &amp; Nobles and I spent a couple hours there, but it was just sitting in the cafe catching up with a friend so that doesn't count as a bookstore experience. <br /><br />I picked up a couple of books at Borders, but hardly the haul I thought I'd come away with. I almost picked up Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, but even with the discount it was cheaper on the Kindle and I don't really care if that book graces my bookshelves or not. I seriously considered picking up a <a href=\"http://goldprospectingmagazine.com/\">Gold Prospectors magazine</a> because it was 40% off and seriously? They make magazines for Gold Prospectors? It even had an old timey prospector on the cover. But aside from awesome magazine and the crazy long line to check out, the experience at Borders was mostly the same as it was when business was in full swing. The people were nice, things were in order (I was there fairly early before the inevitable tornado of destruction came through) but that was about it. Nothing special.<br /><br />Meanwhile I recently visited the Brookline Booksmith and just loved being in the store. This time I did go out of my way, if only because we were in Boston for the weekend without any real plans, so we decided to wander around the old neighborhood. I picked up 2 more booksg off their discount table at a better rate than what I got at Borders. And sadly one of the Borders books I got was also on the Booksmith discounted table. Dammit. Overall I enjoyed the experience much more, wandering around the aisles, searching through the tables for staff picks. And I didn't even make it downstairs to the used book section. Granted the selection is much smaller than a big box place but when they have what I'm want or suggest something I didn't realize I wanted, I don't mind having to go somewhere else for certain titles.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm getting off topic. The point is I'm sad that any bookstore is closing. I'd be more upset if a local indie store closed than a big chain but either way, less opportunity to browse and buy books is sad. But while I can be sad a bookstore is going away, I can't seem to get worked up that Borders is going away. Sorry. It's not you, it's me.<br /><br />If you're curious, here are the books I picked up:<br />from Borders<br />The Lust Lizard from Melancholy Cove by Christopher Moore<br />Practical Demonkeeping by Christopher Moore<br />Shakespeare and Modern Culture by Marjorie Garber<br /><br />from the Booksmith<br />Gone Baby Gone by Dennis Lehane<br />Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron by Jasper Fforde (Which yes, I know I already read but that was as an eBook and this was cheap enough that this physical copy + the e-copy still cost less than the cover price of the actual book. That was my justification anyway.)","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:41+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:41+00:00","published_at":"2011-08-01T13:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e655dde22641900060a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookstore loyalty","slug":"bookstore-loyalty","url":"/articles/tags/bookstore-loyalty"}]}]},{"id":"53224e655dde22641900060b","title":"Time's a goon, right?","slug":"times-a-goon-right","url":"/articles/times-a-goon-right","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/A+Visit+from+the+Goon+Squad+cover.jpg\" />I picked up A Visit from the Goon Squad. Finally. I don't know why I put it off for so long. I think the Pulitzer intimidated me. As soon as that got slapped on I, consciously or not, began to back away. What if it's too smart for me? What if I don't get it? What if I look dumb?g Lots of bloggers, ones I love and listen to their recommendations, all had excellent things to say about this book. You know what got me to finally start the book? I wish it was that I got over any of those questions there but that would be too mature. No it was in Greg's (of <a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/\">The New Dork Review</a>) review when he mentions a story about a PR specialist working for a genocidal dictator. Because I've read that story before, in a collection of stories called This Is Not Chick Lit. I loved that story; it was my favorite of the collection. I figured the rest of the book can't be that scary. I'm so glad I read this because it is one of my favorite books I've read all year.<br /><br />I loved this book, even after more than a week has passed since I finished it. I let the book percolate and I'm still in love with it. I mentioned that other bloggers had good things to say and if you want real, well-thought out reviews, you should check them out. I posted links at the bottom of this post. I can't promise my thoughts are going to be entirely coherent.<br /><br />The book is a collection of linked short stories. Egan says she considers the work more of a novel instead of short stories but I don't see it that way. I also don't believe that considering this book a novel would have improved it anyway. The themes of time and lost innocence are driven home by the short story format. You're getting brief moments in the characters' lives as they try to understand how they got to the point that their at or questioning where to go next, not in an optimistic I-can-do-anything type of way but in a what-options-are-left way. Arguably you could say Bennie and Sasha are the main characters, but I think that would be misleading. They are the primary connection between everyone but claiming they're the main characters suggests that the various stories are about them instead of about the medley of characters. Part of the joy is that even though the characters are all connected, when you're reading a story about Bennie's then wife, you're not reading about Bennie from someone else's point of view, you're reading about Stephanie, who happens to be married to Bennie. The characters may be questioning how time has passed them, but you're pulled fully into the moment. Egan's writing just grabs you.<br /><br />As the book started getting more and more popular I kept hearing about the PowerPoint chapter. Have you gotten to the PowerPoint chapter? What'd you think about the PowerPoint chapter? So when I turned to that first page of the PowerPoint chapter I couldn't help but think \"Let's see what all the chatter is about\". It's a gimmicky style, sure, but the style works. It's a diary of sorts by Sasha's daughter, titled Great Rock and Roll Pauses, the current obsession of her (probably) autistic brother Lincoln. She's not chronicling specific events as a typical journal might. Instead she is trying to understand her family, especially her parents, and uses various charts, bubbles, bursts of test that a PPT format offers. Alison is still young so she's not looking at lost innocence or how time has passed her by, but Egan keeps the theme of time going through the parents and Lincoln's pauses. There's a great quote (yes you can quote a PPT) from Lincoln:<br /><blockquote>\"The pause makes you think the song will end. And then the isn't really over, so you're relieved. But then the song does actually end, because every song ends, obvious, and THAT. TIME. THE. END. IS. FOR. REAL.\" (281)</blockquote>If you haven't read this yet, please don't let the Pulitzer win scare you off. It's a wonderful collection of stories and as I said, one of my favorites for the year.<br /><br />Here are those posts<a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2011/06/visit-from-goon-squad-by-jennifer-egan.html\">Literary Musings</a><a href=\"http://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.com/2011/04/visit-from-good-squad-time-marches-on.html\">The New Dork Review</a><a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2010/08/visit-from-goon-squad-by-jennifer-egan.html\">The Reading Ape</a> - and it's almost a year ago!<br /><br />I regularly walk into walls and trip going up stairs, so you'd think by now I'd be used to looking dumb.<br /><br />Title quote from page 127<br />Egan, Jennifer.

So before even getting to the review, if you want to be the next recipient of this book, let me know in the comments. All you have to do when you get it is go to the World Book Night site, register where the book now is and then read, enjoy and pass it on.<br /><br />I hadn't heard of this author or this novel until Birdie mentioned Spark in a <a href=\"http://featherednest-birdie.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-ten-tuesday-authors-who-deserve.html\">Tuesday Top Ten</a>. I went into this totally ignorant of the plot and author. Apparently I am capable of doing this, even though I refused to read Never Let Me Go until I already knew the plot, thus making that book far less interesting than if I went in blind. Jean Brodie, by the way, does not at all require you go in not know what's happening so I'm going to go easy on the spoiler warnings.<br /><br />Jean Brodie is a teacher at a girls' school who takes special interest in a group of students, the Brodie set, taking the girls to tea and museums and staying close with them long after they've left her classroom. The headmistress, Miss Mackay, is constantly trying to come up with ways to get rid of Jean Brodie, suggesting she go teach at a more progressive school. To be honest, Miss Mackay makes a good point because Jean Brodie is a pretty awful teacher. I suppose this is supposed to be a free-spirited teacher in the vein of something like Dead Poet's Societyg teaching the students about life, to hell with the books. But she doesn't really do that. She instead focuses her lessons on telling the girls about her love life and her travels. At one point she asks the class who the greatest Italian painter is. One of the girls answers with Da Vinci but Brodie corrects her: \"That is incorrect. The answer is Giotto, he is my favorite.\" (11) There's a lot of talk about how the girls are some of the brightest in the school, and it's all based on the awesomeness that is Jean Brodie in her self-proclaimed prime. I'm not quite sure how they managed that but I'll say kudos to them cos they somehow managed to get an education despite the fact that class lessons were pretending to learn history while Brodie told the girls about her former lover. I guess that counts as history.<br /><br />Her classroom lessons do not make up the majority of the story. Just some set up to what Jean Brodie is like. The majority of the story is made up by the fact that one of the girls betrays Brodie and gets her fired. It's a not a surprise that it happens or who does it, it comes up constantly but to save those who want to be surprised I won't name names.  There's also a lot about Brodie's love of the married art teacher Mr. Lloyd, her affair with the single music teacher Mr. Lowther, and her weird insistence that Rose, a member of the Brodie set, have an affair with Mr. Lloyd so she can live vicariously through her student. I had a few WTF moments.<br /><br />Jean Brodie isn't a particularly likable character, but she's fun to watch. A lot of the story is told from Sandy, one of the Brodie set, so you at least aren't constantly subjected to Brodie's thought process. The book was alright, nothing I would have picked up on my own and I'm not too upset to be passing the book on rather than having it my library.<br /><br />I actually have no idea if this is a good reference because I've never seen the movie but the basic plot line tells me I'm on the right path.<br /><br />I'm really making you guys want this book, aren't I?<br /><br />Title quote from page 10.<br /><br />Spark, Muriel.

I may have recently started the next one, but the first book is still fresh in my mind. Not this time. My computer vacation meant that I had reading time without immediate writing time and thus I'm doing these reviewsg after some time has passed. I know a lot of people let some time pass between the reading and the writing to let the book percolate and really gather their thoughts. This sounds very mature and intelligent and a sure way to get well thought-out, well-rounded post. I never do this and I don't think I have the chops to. I am almost comically absent-minded and out-of-sight-out-of-mind is entirely true for me.<br /><br />So what do you do? Do you have to get your thoughts down immediately? Do you let some time pass? Maybe you write down your initial thoughts, put it aside and then after some time has passed write a review? What do you do if you end up way behind on your writing?<br /><br />This post began with me writing a review of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and ended up being this. Because procrastinating on writing by writing something else is a special level of avoiding the responsibilities I have put on myself.<br /><br />Unless the topic is obscure pop culture references. I am all about those because my head is jammed with them instead of actual facts. Means I rock at bar trivia and can't for the life of me remember what I just walked into the kitchen for.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:42+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:42+00:00","published_at":"2011-07-25T12:50:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e665dde2223b6000145","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Blogging question","slug":"blogging-question","url":"/articles/tags/blogging-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e665dde22fdcf000523","title":"Being dependent on each other to produce the stuff that might become your private treasures - that's bound to do things to your relationship","slug":"being-dependent-on-each-other-to-produce-the-stuff-that-might-become-your-private-treasures-thats-bound-to-do-things-to-your-relationship","url":"/articles/being-dependent-on-each-other-to-produce-the-stuff-that-might-become-your-private-treasures-thats-bound-to-do-things-to-your-relationship","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Never+Let+Me+Go+cover.jpg\" />Awhile back, BCRRCg I won a copy of Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro from <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/\">Soy Chai Bookshelf</a>, which was awesome. The winning of the book I mean. The book was awesome too but I'll get to that. So calm down. This has been a periphery to-be-read book for years now, essentially since it came out. A friend of mine, a trusted book recommender, told me I should, nay must, read this book. And I was going to, I really was. But see he gave me the book to read while a group of us were at a beach house for a long weekend of drinking and relaxing. I picked up the book a few times and really tried to get into it, but something would distract me. Such as \"Look, we just opened up a bottle of wine.\" or \"Do you think we should make a beer run?\" Really important matters. So I didn't read it. I always meant to read it. I always thought of it as a book I wanted to read but I just never got around to it. Some other book would push this one out of the way and I never read it. Apparently all it took was getting a free copy of it that made me read it.<br /><br />Normally I don't worry too much about about spoilers in a book and put the warnings in as almost an after thought. But this is a book that I think requires the spoiler alert because I think the reading experience is better the less you know about it. I assume anyway, since I already knew a decent amount of the plot before going in and wished I didn't. So...<br />Spoilers!<br />This book sneaks up on you. It starts so innocent. It's just the story of a boarding school somewhere in the English countryside, narrated from a former student. You think you know what you're about to get, you think it's going to be a simple coming of age story. But then there are hints that something isn't right and you start to question what's going on in the school, why is there so much emphasis on the students artwork, why are the kids buying used good trucked in from somewhere outside, who is this Madame? The thing that really makes it eerie is the fact that the story is told from the point of view of Kathy H., one of the former students, as she remembers her time in Hailsham and the few years after. Her narration feels like you're sitting with Kathy as she tells you her story. You don't necessarily feel like a confidant. It's more like Kathy is sort of weary telling you this story, and she jumps around a bit, bringing up something and telling you she'll explain to you why that was important in a bit.<br /><br />Slowly you find out what is really going on at the school, or more accurately what's really going on with the students. They're clones with no parents and no ability to become parents themselves who are created and raised to eventually provide organs to the \"real people\". There's no sadness from the students, from Kathy and her friends Ruth and Tommy. There's no desire to try to avoid their fate to go through their 4 donations and then eventually \"complete\". I was going to say there's no big reveal moment where this reality comes to light, but I suppose there is. It doesn't feel like a big reveal though because the students don't respond to the news as if it's a big reveal. Kathy remembers how they were often \"told but not told\" about what their future held, how they were given the information when they were just too young to really understand what it meant, so they always knew what was coming without ever examining the details. You, the reader, get upset and offended and expect the characters to react the same way and then they just...don't. So then you start to question your reaction and you end up with an uneasy feeling as the story never progresses the way you thought it would. It's like a sociological experiment and you're the subject.<br /><br />I suppose this isn't the best review of the book. It's really only looking at the twist that isn't even really a twist because it comes fairly early on. But obviously this is the biggest part of the book and the part I most want to be like omgsomeonetalktomeaboutthis! If you want a well thought out, well-written review, I would like to direct you over to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2116040/\">the review Margaret Atwood wrote for Slate</a>.<br />Spoilers over<br /><br />This book was excellent. I wanted something more but it was mostly because the story is so far from what you're expecting. I certainly recommend it to people and the less you know the better. Though obviously if you haven't read the book and you skipped over the spoilers part, you haven't really learned anything about the book. Trust me, that's the best way to go about this book. Just dive right in.<br /><br />That would be \"Before China-Rican Reading Challenge\"<br /><br />He's the friend that lent me Special Topics in Calamity Physics which I really need to get back to him.<br /><br />Specifically the one where they put a bunch of people in a room together and had them fill out some form. All of a sudden a smoke alarm starts going off and smoke starts coming in from under a door. Well you'd think everyone would get out of there cos FIRE. But really all but one person is in on the experiment. The one person usually looks around to see what the group wants to do and they decide it's best to just sit in the room until the proctor comes back. Most of the time the subject agrees even though it means (in their mind anyway) they're about to be roasted.

Books - well obviously. I mean really, the title of the post says Reader's beach-going necessities, did you think books wouldn't be first on the list? If so, you've clearly stumbled here by accident and I'm not sure you'll find what you're looking for. Go ahead, sneak out the back. I won't mind.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Sunglasses.jpg\" />2. Sunglasses - you need to be able to see to read the books. This is my current sunglasses collection, most of which are cracked, scratched or lay crooked across my face. I recently spent the big money ($15) on a pair of sunglasses not bought off some guy on the street, so clearly I'm moving on up in the world.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/beach+chairs.jpg\" />3. Beach chair - I hate laying on my back or stomach while reading. I just get weird cramps that I try to ignore so I can just finish this chapter and dammit, now my shoulder is all stiff.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/sunscreen.jpg\" />4. Sunscreen - must remember not to get so engrossed in the book that you forget sunscreen. I have between SPF70-100 because I practically glow in the dark. And yes, I know nothing over 45 blocks out more sun, but the higher the number the longer it takes for the burning to start. Since I burn when I think about the sun for too long, I go high.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Skin+tone.jpg\" /> Mocking me with melanin 5. Umbrella - I learned the hard way that sunscreen alone will not keeping me from turning into a lobster and thus, the umbrella was necessary. Boyfriend tends to shun it, along with laughing at me for my sunscreen while he dabs on SPF15.  The sun seems to actually enjoy him. Here's a photo of his skin versus mine for reference.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Umbrella+anchor.jpg\" />6. Umbrella anchor - yes, this is important enough to get a separate number. This was another lesson learned the hard way. I thought we had the umbrella and all would be grand. We showed up to the beach, jammed the umbrella into the sand as far as we could and approximately 10 minutes later the thing started to fall. Meanwhile all of these other families around us, who were clearly seasoned pros, brought with them this amazing contraption. They put it in the sand, twisted a couple times and BOOM, the umbrella is secured. Winds that were blowing small children around could not take down their umbrellas.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Burger+%2526+Beer.jpg\" />7.

Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. Not just because I wanted to read it but was in the middle of the China Rican reading challenge. I was/am a big fan of their first book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything and was looking forward to a follow up as soon as I finished this one. But I wanted the book in paperback and I had to wait for it. I would read through a few pages whenever Boyfriend dragged me to the Apple store, so thank you Jobs for making SuperFreakonomics one of the example books in your book store.<br /><br />SuperFreakonomics is a mix of economics and sociology, albeit a simplified version of both. Levitt's credentials, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, covers the economics details, while Dubner, a former writer and editor for The New York Times, takes on the writing duties. The title quote covers the basic theme to both books, and they elaborate on this further: \"People respond to incentives, although not necessarily in ways that are predictable or manifest. Therefore, one of the most powerful laws in the universe is the law of unintended consequences.\" (xiv) They ask what seem like unusual or even pointless questions: what does a department store Santa and street prostitute have in common? or should a suicide bomber buy life insurance? and then use statistics to tease out an answer.<br /><br />They examine problems but don't necessarily offer solutions. They're not really trying to persuade anyone that the results they provide mean we have to take any sort of action. Indeed, if there's anything one should take away from this it's the idea that things are related in crazy ways that may not seem obvious at first, second, third look and before dismissing something it's important to look at the problem from lots of different angles. They never claim their results are infallible and encourage people to challenge them on <a href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/\">their blog</a>. I've seen complaints about how the conclusions they come to are garbage and they're research methods are incomplete. That could certainly be the case, but you can't actually tell what their research methods are in this book because the book isn't made up of academic papers. If it was, I don't think it would be nearly as interesting because, let's face it, academic research papers aren't usually the most interesting thing to read and an NYT Bestseller they do not make.<br /><br />If you liked Freakonomics, you'll probably like this one. It's really just more of the same, but that's not a bad thing. There are an unlimited amount of questions to be asked and this book just asks a few that didn't get asked with the first book. To be honest, if they end up writing another book, I'll probably read that one as well.<br /><br />Title quote from page xiv<br /><br />Dubner, Stephen and Steven Levitt.

Learning about Chinese culture through their pop culture? Sounds good to me. Plus after finishing up <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/no-one-living-in-dictatorship-has\">Beijing Coma</a>, which deals with the massacre at Tiananmen Square, I needed something up-lifting about this topic.<br /><br />Zha focuses on a small period of time, from Tiananment to when the book is written in '95. She mentions the past only in order to give context to the direction things have gone but focuses on contemporary issues. This is what drew me to book. Well that and the bright colors. I wanted something to tell me that things weren't as pessimistic as I was feeling at the end of Beijing Coma. And I knew nothing of Chinese culture except the basic stereotypes that have filtered through my own pop culture. Even after reading this I can't say I know much, not because Zha does a bad job explaining and exploring the culture but because there is so much to know and obviously one book is not going to make me an expert. But this was an interesting introduction<br /><br />Here's the thing: I'm not quite sure anyone's really explained to Zha what really constitutes pop culture. The book starts off on this foot, discussing the insanely popular soap opera Yearnings, how it came to be, how it's seen by different groups in China and some effects it's had on the culture. But after this she moves into city planning and architecture, avante guard movie making, literature and the business side of Hong Kong's proliferation in pop music. Not the music itself, but the way the company expanded and ran after internal changes. This was still interesting but not what I was lead to believe I would be reading.<br /><br />Her chapter Yellow Peril about the author Jia Pingwa's book The Abandoned Capital probably does the best job of bridging the gap between the pop culture she say's she's going to talk about and the high art she actually tackles. The book captured the nation's attention because of the explicit, by China's standards anyway, sex scenes. The book was eventually banned, which of course just made the book that much more popular. She interviews the author about the response to his book as well as several \"elite intellectuals\" about the book and its affect on the culture. Maybe because this chapter had to do with a book I found it one of the most interesting ones.<br /><br />Unless you're looking to learn more about China's culture in the years right after Tiananmen, I wouldn't recommend picking this up. It was interesting for what it was but if it hadn't been for this challenge I don't think I would have stuck with this book.<br /><br />Title quote from page 7<br /><br />Zha, Jianying.

But I didn't. Perhaps emboldened by the completion of Beijing Coma or because the month isn't actually over and I didn't want to quit, I picked up another book for this <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/china-rican-reading-month-is-here\">China Rican challenge</a>. I skipped over another Puerto Rican book because I've been having a hard enough time finding titles, let alone titles that I want to read. Plus, even if I did find something, I'd have to buy it. Instead I went with another Chinese book for a couple reasons.<br /><br />First up, China Pop by Jianying Zhu was already sitting on the shelf. In college, Boyfriend took a couple Chinese classes: language, culture, philosophy. So he has some Chinese books laying around the house. No Chinese lit, but things that qualify for this challenge. So it was easy to get. Plus it has bright colors and is about pop culture, which means it sparked my interest. The more trivial the topic, the more interesting I find it. There must be some inverse mathematical formula that can be applied there, but I'll let some of my smarter friends figure that out. I asked him how the book was and he shrugged his shoulders and said pretty boring. Super. Hopefully he's wrong.<br /><br />Second, this picks up discussing Tiananmen Square, the horrors that happened there and the cultural move from that point onward through China's shifting identity. And I need that because my reaction to the ending of Beijing Coma was similar to my reaction to Orwell's 1984: I wanted to hide under the covers with my fingers in my ears and pretend nothing like that could ever happen. I'm pretty sure I turned on the TV after I finished the book, but I was just blankly staring at the images while trying to process what I'd just read. I needed something to show me not everything is dark and evil and there is hope, even if it's wrapped up with a Chinese soap opera.<br /><br />So yeah, the challenge that I debated giving up on not long ago. I extended it. Because I'm a glutton for punishment apparently. Review to come soon.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:45+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:45+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-30T13:18:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e695dde226419000612","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"reading challenge","slug":"reading-challenge","url":"/articles/tags/reading-challenge"}]}]},{"id":"53224e695dde2223b6000148","title":"No one living in a dictatorship has a healthy state of mind","slug":"no-one-living-in-a-dictatorship-has-a-healthy-state-of-mind","url":"/articles/no-one-living-in-a-dictatorship-has-a-healthy-state-of-mind","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Beijing+Coma+cover.jpg\" />I just finished up Ma Jian's Beijing Coma and wow. Just...wow. Obviously I've mentioned on here a number of times that this is a long book. I did a whole whining post about how I wanted to break this up with another book. It wasn't solely the length that made me want to put this down and pick up something else. This is an emotionally draining book.<br /><br />If you already know all about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989\">Tiananmen Square massacre</a> and the events leading up to it, congratulations, you're starting out in a better place than me. It's embarrassing how little I know about Chinese history of any time period and especially when it concerns years I was actually alive. Granted I was all of 5 when this happened and my high school history classes never seemed to make it past the Industrial Revolution but still. Literally the only thing I even recognized about it before starting this book is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_man\">Tank Man</a>. So on the one hand, yay I'm a blank slate going into this book. On the other hand oh my God, this can't really be real. How could this happen? How could I not know?<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Tank+Man.jpg\" /><br />Beijing Coma tells the story of Dai Wei, who has been in a coma due to a gunshot would to the head during the massacre. The story jumps between Dai Wei's memories and the present day. He recalls his early life as the child of a \"rightest\", his university days, and primarily the escalating protests in Tianament Square, where he is head of security. His present day covers his years in the coma, being take care of by his mother who was at first an adamant supporter of the Party but slowly changes her mind. He finds out how things changed after the protest, what happened to his friends, girlfriends, brother.<br /><br />His memories around the weeks of protest are certainly the primary focus, but I preferred his early life and the coma sections more. I suppose there's this assumption that there is a darkness before the dawn. The massacre is certainly the darkness so afterwards things had to improve in Beijing. But they don't, not for Dai Wei's family, certainly not for his mother, who was my favorite character. She's at once resentful she has to take care of her comatose son, often wishing him dead, while at the same time completely devoted to him. You can feel her frustrations, and she never comes off as some one-dimensional monster. She can't work because caring for Dai Wei is a full time job, yet she can't even get proper care for him because of his involvement in the protests.<br />gSpoiler<br />At one point, she has to sell one of Dai Wei's kidneys in order to get money to keep caring for him. There are so many acts of desperation I don't know why this one stands out so much for me, but it did. It isn't the worst thing depicted, but it's the one I guess that I can actually wrap my head around.<br />Continue on. You're safe from spoilers now<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tiananmen+protests.jpg\" />Dai Wei seems to get caught up in the fervor of the protests but never seems to really care about what everything is for. He doesn't slack at his job, but he's just going along with everyone else. And there is so much in-fighting as different students struggle for power of the square. That got repetitive and would have benefited from some culling.It was the same fights over and over again that they began to blur together. I suppose that itself says something for the mood of the time, but I had trouble staying focused.<br /><br />Overall this was an incredible, heartbreaking, terrifying book and I'm extremely glad I read it, despite any of my whining to the contrary.<br /><br />Sidenote: Not only does Kindle let you highlight and make notes, but it keeps track of everything and gives you a total. With previous books I've had maybe 20 at the most notes/highlights. This time I have 71. Granted this book is long but it's still a greater amount than the other ebooks I've read. There is so much here I wanted to go back to, so much I was ignorant of and Ma Jian has a way with words that many of these passages could stand alone without the book feeling like a cobbled together series of quotes. Although I suppose the compliments of the language go almost as much to the translator Flora Drew.<br /><br />Title quote from location 3749<br /><br />Jian, Ma. Beijing Coma. Trans. Flora Drew.

Does having a clear agenda enhance or subtract from its literary value?<br /><br />It's hard to think of a book that doesn't have some sort of agenda or promote something beyond just the story at hand. Of course this may not be entirely intentional on the author's part or at least the author may not have set out to write a persuasion piece, but for the most part a story is going to have some sort of larger purpose. Now whether this enhances or detracts from the story, well that's up to how good the author is.<br /><br />I may or may not have mentioned a zillion times that I'm reading Beijing Coma. It's about the protests that happened in Tienanmen Square in '89 and get out of town, that has some politics in it? But, thus far anyway, there is no political diatribe for or against what happened, the movement, the government, anything. There is no point where it feels like Ma Jian puts his own words into a characters mouth. That doesn't mean Ma Jian doesn't agree with a point one of his character's is making, but at no point am I removed from the story to listen to him prattle on about something that could easily be removed from the book with no harm to the story.<br /><br />Connie mentions George Orwell's Animal Farm and how Orwell fully acknowledges the agenda he had while writing the book, and while the message is clear it doesn't detract from the story. But even stories that don't have a set out agenda still make some point.<br /><br />I don't know what Austen's intentions were when she set out to write Pride and Prejudice but the character Lizzie certainly seems from beyond her time, perhaps echoing the type of woman that Austen wanted to see. Or perhaps I've brought my own agenda to the reading.<br /><br />So, what do you think?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:46+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:46+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-23T12:24:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6a5dde2223b600014b","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6a5dde2223b600014c","title":"Why I avoid challenges","slug":"why-i-avoid-challenges","url":"/articles/why-i-avoid-challenges","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/piles+of+books.jpg\" />I am 65% of the way through Ma Jian's Beijing Coma which translates to 468 pages out of 720 and I really wish now Kindle would just put little page numbers on here in addition to the location and percentage stuff. I need at least 3 different indicators of how far along a book I am when I don't have the weight of the book in front of me. Anyway, what I'm saying is, I'm not going to have a review of this anytime soon. I know I tend to post multiple times about a book while I'm reading it, but believe it or not, I do tend to do that only if I have something to say. Or at least I think I have something I want to say. Whether you think I did is really a different matter. I have lots I want to mention but so far it mostly has to do with how little I know about this period of Chinese history, even though I was alive for most of the time period described. Don't worry, I'll go into how pathetic I am in that post. Right now though what I'd like to do is take a little break from Beijing Coma so I have a new, less-depressing book and maybe something I can post about. I don't have a problem breaking up a book like this. I did it with Strange &amp; Norrell and that book wasn't even depressing. Just ridiculously long.<br /><br />Here's my problem though: I'm doing this China Rican reading challenge. But I don't really want to break up Beijing Coma with another book for this challenge. See I haven't really been able to find, well, any books I can use for the Puerto Rican part of this challenge. I only have the 2, the one I already read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/what-jibara\">When I Was Puerto Rican</a> and I heard about another one called The Time It Snowed in Puerto Rico. I read about the \"snow\" one on someone else's blog and honestly, they didn't have great things to say about it. It was OK but not really worth it. I added it to my list in the hopes that I'd find something better. But I haven't yet. And When I Was Puerto Rican was alright but a bit of a let down as well. So I don't really have another challenge book I can use to break up Beijing Coma, at least nothing I'm looking forward to reading.<br /><br />To top that off, I do have a pile of books that I really do want to read, just staring me in the face with these Disney eyes, asking why I'm ignoring them. I know lots of people have insane TBR piles, but I don't. When I say my TBR pile I'm referring to an imaginary list that I'd like to maybe get around to reading at some point. I don't typically have an actual, physical pile of books. This time however, I do have that stackg. And I want to read them, but none of them qualify for this challenge. Yeah, I know I made up this challenge. No one actually would care if I finished it. Hell, Boyfriend doesn't even really care. At one point I asked him what he thought of me doing this and he just laughed. Granted that was most likely his reaction to watching me run in circles while playing L.A. Noire which really just means he ignored my question. Because I think that he likes that I'm doing it on some level, but really it doesn't matter to him all that much. He doesn't want to say it doesn't matter, hence the change in subject. Even though he doesn't care, and really precisely because no one cares, I don't want to cheat, because then I'm just cheating me. OK, so I'll stick to the challenge, but now the challenge is starting to feel like work. And I hate that.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is, I'm glad I started this challenge because I read some books I very likely wouldn't have picked up and I have a whole bunch of Chinese authors on my TBR pile (the imaginary list one) to check out and I do think I'm learning slightly more about the countries and cultures. And I've cemented why I normally avoid challenges and that I'll most likely be avoiding them in the future.<br /><br />If you're curious, here's my current stack of books that is just waiting for me to finish up with this challenge so I can get to them:<br />A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan<br />Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro<br />The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark<br />Hogdoggin' by Anthony Neil Smith<br />Tokyo Vice by Jake Adelstein<br />Superfreakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner<br /><br />OK, the last game I just finished playing (replaying) was Luigi's Mansion so obviously I am a sporadic gamer. I've watched people play the GTA series but I've never done it myself. So what I'm saying is the controls are all new to me and quit laughing at me just because I get stuck between like every door and gate there is in this stupid game and omg did the suspect get away AGAIN because I still can't figure out how to read a map.

A chance to talk with other bookish people - This is my favorite reason for book blogging and an unexpected one. Let's face it, reading can be a solitary hobby. So I love that I've had the chance to meet (in the digital sense) lots of other bookish people and we can talk about books and lit and other topics that other friends of mine and I never talk about. We tried at one point to do a book club which ended up just being a hang around and drink wine club. I had a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but it didn't satisfy my desire to discuss books.<br />2. A chance to write - As an English major in college, I wrote a lot. Paper after paper after paper it seemed. While I can't say I miss the deadlines and the long nights, I was starting to miss the act of writing. Boyfriend convinced me that a blog was a good way to get back into the habit. Also I think he thought this outlet for my random thoughts would spare him some of my ramblings, but little did he know I have lots of babble to go around.<br />3. Tracking my reading - I never kept track of the books I read. I'd read a book and never really looking at a big picture of what I'm reading. Tracking the books here, especially with my monthly reading wrap-ups, gives me an idea of how my reading is shaping up and where I could improve a bit. Plus, I'm fairly forgetful so having all the books I've read written down will help me remember what I read and what I thought.<br />4. Book recommendations - Following up the topic of tracking my reading. book blogging has also provided me with lots of new book recommendations. Prior to this I had a few friends I would get book recommendations from but I was reading a lot of the same stuff. Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff I was picking up (a lot of Christopher Moore) but I wanted to expand my horizons and didn't know where to start. Not only was I reading a lot of similar things, but I was also re-reading a lot because I'd never know what new books were worth the time. I'm doing less re-reading now because there are so many new books I want to read. Plus I don't want to be writing about the same book multiple times here.<br />5. Bookish recommendations - It's not just book recommendations but book-related ones that I love. When they first came out I was never crazy about e-readers. But book bloggers helped convince me to get one. I read a bunch of posts about them, both for and against, people linked to stories about Kindles and Nooks and ebooks, and I learned what I needed to know to make an informed decision.<br /><br />OK so even here I didn't come up with 10 but these are 5 very strong reasons why I love this! What about you? Why do you love book blogging or even just being bookish in general?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:46+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:46+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-21T12:13:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6a5dde22fdcf00052c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6b5dde22fdcf00052d","title":"Where I've been","slug":"where-ive-been","url":"/articles/where-ive-been","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Where+have+you+been.jpg\" />I wanted to give a little explanation as to where I've been this last week when I clearly wasn't posting here. I suppose this is really for the 2 of youg who even noticed I've been MIA here and on Twitter.<br /><br />First up, Beijing Coma is long. I mean not the longest-book-everrrrr or anything, but longer than I was expecting. This is especially notable because <a href=\"http://petekarnas.wordpress.com/\">Pete from What You Read</a>, who gave me the recommendation, mentioned the length. And, since I downloaded the book onto my Kindle, I checked out how many pages the paperback version has (720) so it's not that I didn't know exactly how long it is. It's just that with the Kindle I'm not constantly reminded of the length except as I'm watching the \"percentage finished\" bar barely move, no matter how many pages I turn. I apparently don't equate that with length, just my reading speed. I have a feeling I'll be here for awhile. I may break up the book and pick up another Puerto Rican author in the middle. We'll see.<br /><br />Secondly, I was assuming going into this month, that I was going to have way more reading time. When I moved down to LI I was still working for the job I had in Boston. My job is primarily through email and phone calls anyway (the majority of my clients are in Dallas, Seattle and NYC) so the move wasn't too much of an issue for me to work from home. The plan was I would start working part time in June. This meant I'd have lots of extra time for reading, blogging and job searching. And as happens anytime I make plans, things change. There was some restructuring within my group which gave me the chance to keep working full time. As the rent isn't going to start paying itself and this opened some new opportunities, I took that. This change meant I have far less time to do all of these aforementioned things. Even quickly popping over to Twitter or my Google Reader hasn't happened all that much. Don't get me wrong, I like being busy at work. It's just doubly unexpected.<br /><br />So those are my excuses. And of course this gave me a reason to post. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take some more screenshots and figure out how to make sure Twitter people's curses quit sneaking around these filters.<br /><br />For the rest of you, what do you mean you have your own lives and aren't just sitting around in a dark room waiting for the genius that is my posts and tweets? That can't be right at all.<br />I love my commute, I miss face-to-face interactions with people","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:47+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:47+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-17T16:29:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6b5dde22fdcf00052e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224e6b5dde22fdcf00052f","title":"What a jibara","slug":"what-a-jibara","url":"/articles/what-a-jibara","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/when-i-was-puerto-rican.jpg\" />I now have 2 books down for my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/china-rican-reading-month-is-here\">China Rican reading challenge</a>.  First up was something from the Chinese corner with Amy Tan's <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/he-was-hulihudu-power-of-my-words-was\">The Joy Luck Club</a>. Now I've just finished an  entry from the Puerto Rican side with Esmeralda Santiago's memoir When I Was Puerto Rican.<br /><br />Santiago chronicles her early life living in rural Puerto Rico, eventually moving to a suburb just outside of San Juan and eventually ending up in Brooklyn. She is the oldest of many siblings (12 by the time she's in high school), loves her Mami despite the strictness and occasional beatings, and loves her Papi despite his repeated disappearing on the family. Santiago's real talent lies in her descriptions of her surroundings: the oregano bushes that grew near the latrine, the smell of the garlic her mother cooked with, the crocheted bedspread her grandmother made. She is able to paint such a vivid picture you can almost feel yourself squinting into the strong Puerto Rican sunlight.<br /><br />Perhaps because the culture is different from my own, I liked it when she described her home, her barrio, and her experiences growing up in Macun. In the early portion of the book she talked about jibaros which she defines in the glossary as Rural Puerto Rican with distinctive dialect and customs (location 4351). She talks about at first wanting to be one and then later when she moves closer to San Juan being taunted by the other kids and teachers with \"What a jibara\"<br /><blockquote>Poems and stories about the hardships and joys of the Puerto Rican jibaro were required reading at every grade level in school. My own grandparents, whom I was to respect as well as love, were said to be jibaros. But I couldn't be one, nor was I to call anyone a jibaro, lest they be offended. Even at the tender age when I didn't yet know my real name, I was puzzled by the hypocrisy of celebrating a people everyone looked down on. (location 170)</blockquote>Her settings almost make up for the lack of description around the characters of her memoir. You hear very little about her brothers and sisters and they really just form one lump of siblings for Esmeralda, or Negi as her family calls her, to fight with. Her Mami and Papi get the most description, but even they are very one-dimensional. There's very little dialogue, so there's never a chance to get to know these other characters. <br /><br />Overall the story itself doesn't really go anywhere. There is no story arc to follow, just a series of events as her family moves around and around. The story has wonderful moments but it never adds up to a whole.<br /><br />Title quote from location 506<br /><br />Santiago, Esmeralda. When I Was Puerto Rican.

Soon-ish) but in the meantime I thought I'd take part in this week's <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2011/06/literary-blog-hop-june-9-11.html\">Literary Blog Hop, hosted by The Blue Bookcase</a>. I've skipped out on the last few because I haven't felt like I had anything to add to the conversation, but I've decided not to let that stand in my way this week.<br /><br />This week's question is: What outside influences affect your reading experience? Do you think these influences enhance or detract from the experience?<br /><br />Obviously outside influences affect what I read and how I read it. No man's an island, people don't live in a vacuum, etc, etc. There are the obvious bits such as general hype around the book, if the book is considered a \"classic\", what friends and family may have to say about it, what the cover looks likeg, and on and on. But Meagan wants to know what other influences out there change the way we read. Fine make this more difficult.<br /><br />There's a scene in one of the later Thursday Next books where the characters discuss how much a reader actually brings to a book and that the reader should get as much credit as the author for bringing a work to life. Without the reader's imagination the words don't have much power. Of course, if the reader has gets so much credit for a book, that means each person that reads a book is going to bring their own beliefs, their own past, their own morals to the table and have a different experience from every other person. The experience could be similar or wildly different. It's not only different people but one person can have an entirely different reading experience from the same book if read at different times.<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye is an example of this. I first read it at 15, which is prime age to read this. I was sort of a pain in the ass teenager, and now I'm not sure if my English teacher was being nice or insulting when he suggested I read this book for a report because he thought I'd like it. And I did like it. Holden was great, everyone was a phony, angst, angst, angst. I decided to read it again at some point in college and man Holden was annoying. Shut up already with the whining. But I didn't expect this. I expected to like the book just like I did when I was in high school. But my experiences had changed and I could no longer see what 15 year old me saw.<br /><br />I want to re-read 1984 for similar if opposite reasons. I read this book when I was about 14 and hated it. I didn't think it was a badly written book or boring or a stupid story. I hated it because it terrified me. I just wanted to hide under my bed with my hands over my eyes, because obviously that would keep Big Brother from showing up. But people talk about loving the book so I feel like I should give it another shot. I don't know how I'll react to the book this time, but even if I'm still terrified I'm sure that fear will be coming from a new place. Then I'll even more reasons to hate the book.<br /><br />Yes, of course I judge a book by its cover. That's the covers purpose. Don't be so judge-y. Everyone does it. Except blind people I suppose. They are free from cover prejudice.<br /><br />See I didn't use etc again. That's called skills<br /><br />How often can I bring these books up? Constantly obviously. Also I am going nuts with footnotes today. I'll try to stop.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-09T15:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6c5dde22fdcf000532","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6c5dde22fdcf000533","title":"Favorite Book Settings","slug":"favorite-book-settings","url":"/articles/favorite-book-settings","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" />I have been slacking on these weekly Broke and the Bookish Top Ten Tuesday posts. The last two topics just didn't inspire me to write anything worth reading. Or rather, they didn't inspire me to babble on long enough to make it a post. But this week's topic is my <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/06/janas-top-ten-favorite-book-settings.html\">favorite book settings</a>. Now that it's summer I'm in a vacation-y mood. But my limited funds and the need to work to make up those meager rations means I can't travel around as much as I'd like. So books have to pick up the slack and here are some of my favorite locales to escape to:<br /><br />General settings I love<br />NYC - I don't have a single book in mind for this, just that I love NYC so books set there make me happy. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/only-possible-way-you-can-do-this-is-to\">Jack Finney's </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/but-it-was-fine-and-exciting-ladies\">Time and Again</a> covers both old and new New York, so you get a little variety. But I'm all for NYC as it is now and anything where I can think \"I know that area\" makes me smile.<br /><br />Boston - speaking of knowing the area, after having lived in Boston for almost a decade I like books set there. I like knowing my way around the setting and little quirks of the neighborhoods that the author may not necessarily come right out and say. It's one of the reasons I think I enjoyed Mystic River by Dennis Lehane and All Souls by Michael Patrick McDonald so much.<br /><br />Italy - Again with the knowing of the area. I didn't spend as much time here, but I fell in love with the place those four months I did live there and so I love anything taking place here. Almost to the point where I'll pick up Under the Tuscan Sun or Eat, Pray, Love. Almost. Instead I sate myself with Bryson's Italian travels in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/travel-is-more-fun-hell-life-is-more\">Neither Here Nor There</a><br /><br />Specific settings I wish I could go to<br />Hogwarts from Harry Potter - It would be awesome to actually be able to do magic. And Hogwarts seems like a fun place to hang out, even if it's pretty unsuitable for children. There probably shouldn't be that many ways to die in a school but whatever.<br /><br />Bookworld from the Thursday Next series - Notice the title? It's a world. Of books. How can that not be amazing? For those unfamiliar, Bookworld is literally a world where the characters from novels live. They reside primarily within their own book but can hop around and visit others, visit the seedy Well of Lost Plots, or even work for JurisFiction (yup, that's policing fiction).<br /><br />Well, I came up with 5 settings anyway. I'm sure as I hop around I'll see some more and think \"damn, I should have thought of that one\".<br /><br />What are your favorite book settings?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-07T13:47:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6c5dde22fdcf000534","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6c5dde22fdcf000535","title":"Overreacting parents and YA fiction","slug":"overreacting-parents-and-ya-fiction","url":"/articles/overreacting-parents-and-ya-fiction","body":"The interwebs, at least the book section of it, seems to be up-in-arms over a recent WSJ piece <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576357622592697038.html\">Darkness Too Visible by Meghan Cox Gurdon</a> about how YA is too dark and disturbing for little cherub teenagers and they're minds are being corrupted if they read this stuff and they'll all become serial killers and whatnot. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo\">Won't somebody please think of the children</a>. The usual complaints that pop up every few years. I'm not going to worry about that argument or even get into the #YASaves hashtag that popped up on Twitter. Plenty of other people have taken this up and written in defense of YA. I don't think I have too much to add to that argument. I don't really read YA now and when I was 13 I read a weird mix of Alexander Dumas and Stephen King, so I won't be able to share a story about how YA saved me.<br /><br />Here's the part that I do want to share and why I'm having trouble getting worked up over this latest call for censorship: Gurdon seems to be going off a knee-jerk reaction to the main YA titles represented in bookstores. Here's a line from the opening of the piece:<br /><blockquote>[Amy Freeman] had popped into the bookstore to pick up a welcome-home gift for her 13-year-old, who had been away. Hundreds of lurid and dramatic covers stood on the racks before her, and there was, she felt, \"nothing, not a thing, that I could imagine giving my daughter. It was all vampires and suicide and self-mutilation, this dark, dark stuff.\" She left the store empty-handed.</blockquote>Granted, this is not Gurdon's own experience, but rather her telling of a different mother's failed journey to find a book for her teen. Freeman walks into a bookstore, looks around and see books she doesn't like for her daughter and leaves. Without buying anything. Again, she wants to buy a book for her daughter, sees some YA books she doesn't want for her daughter and she leaves without getting her any books. I'm pretty sure had Freeman looked slightly to the left, she probably would have seen some non-vampire, self-mutilation books that would have made a fine gift. I'm often able to go into a bookstore and avoid the shelves of books I don't want. Part of that freewill thing I try to make use of. So she didn't like the YA book options that make up the majority of that section. I don't either. Welcome to the club. Find something else for your daughter if you don't want her reading it. Plenty of other options available. Hell, I'm sure there are other options within the YA shelf. But she looked at the shelves, freaked out over a couple titles and left.<br /><br />Again, I know this isn't Gurdon's experience, but she chose it to open her story and thus I'm applying the Freeman's reaction to what Gurdon sees as a reasonable reaction to the state of YA publishing. And that alone is keeping me from taking this seriously. In the end I'm against general censorship, but if you don't want your kid reading something, it's your kid. Go ahead and keep it from them. That's your choice as a parent. Hopefully you're taking the time to really understand what the books you're banning around about (sadly I doubt this happens very often) but if not, well, just don't get in the way of me reading what I want.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:48+00:00","published_at":"2011-06-06T17:25:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6c5dde22fdcf000536","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"censorship","slug":"censorship","url":"/articles/tags/censorship"},{"value":"YA Fiction","slug":"ya-fiction","url":"/articles/tags/ya-fiction"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6d5dde226419000613","title":"He was hulihudu.

It's a series of connected stories about mothers and daughters, about remembering the past and looking forward to the future. Four women came over from China around the 1940s and together formed the Joy Luck Club, a weekly mahjong club where they could remember their homes, gossip about their neighborhood and brag about their children. The story begins with Jing-Mei Woo taking the place of her recently deceased mother, Suyuan Woo, who started the Joy Luck Club. She's worried she can never fill her mother's shoes and when she had mentioned someone once commented how alike Jing-Mei and her mother were, Suyuan responded \"You don't even know littler percent of me! How can you be me?\" (15). And thus we hear the histories of the 4 members of the clubs: An-mei Hsu, Lindo Jong, Ying-Ying St. Clair and Suyuan, whose story is told through her daughter.<br /><br />Jing-Mei isn't the only one worried about not understanding her mother and the other half of the book is dedicated to stories from the Joy Luck Club member's daughters (Rose Hsu Jordan, Waverly Jong and Lena St. Clair), tales from their childhood in San Francisco and then their lives in the present. The theme between all of the families is tension between the generations. None of the daughters feel that they know their mothers and indeed the stories told in the mothers' stories are not shared with their children. Only Jing-Mei hears the full story about her mother and only after she is gone. The mothers feel this disconnect as well, a rift between Chinese customs and American life. Lindo Jong says \"I wanted my children to have the best combination: American circumstances and Chinese character. How could I know these two things do not mix?\" (289).<br /><br />I preferred the mothers' stories. Maybe because China is so foreign to me or because all of the stories take place pre-1940s but whatever the reason, they felt more like legends or fairy tales, with morals and lessons to be learned. Every action, every event has some deeper meaning. The daughters' stories are modern, especially when they are older and their stories deal with their careers and relationships. These are still well written and interesting stories, but compared to the mothers' stories they're mundane. The don't have the spark that their mothers' histories have.<br /><br />It's easy to forget that parents have lies before kids. Logically, you know this is the case.. You can be told the stories and see the pictures, but really accepting and understanding this as truth is a different. I know my mom was someone before she was my mom. She grew up a little of everywhere, from Taiwan to Libya to the Statesg and I can be told this is the case but every once in awhile it will hit me that it's true. My mom recently took a trip to Egypt and has a picture of herself on a camel. I thought it was great and we never traveled around much when I was little so I forget she has spent plenty of time outside the US. She sent the photo to my aunt who responded with \"Who cares. You did that when you were in the 4th grade\" and it hits me that these aren't her first trips. They're just her first trips since I've been here and clearly I'm the center of the universe so nothing happened before I was around. Everyone just waited quietly in dark rooms until I arrived. <br /><br />Jing-Mei comes to a similar realization. She remembers her mother saying a bomb had fallen on the family home and killed everyone, so they had no family back at home. She recalls her mother \"had said this so matter-of-factly that I had thought she had long since gotten over any grief she had.\" It's not until Jing-Mei prods, asking how can she really know that they all died and that they didn't get out of the house in time that her mother tells her the story of going back to search through the wreckage and finding a doll that had belonged to her niece. \"She cried if that doll was not with her always. Do you see? If she was in the house with that doll, her parents were there and so everybody was there, waiting together, because that's how our family was\" ( 313-314). She knows the basic story of her mother's life in China, but it's difficult to relate to it as real people when it's her mother.<br /><br />Amy Tan's prose is simple and beautiful. It's not overly decorative or overly complicated, but she paints vivid pictures of her character's lives. As I said, I prefer the mothers' stories and I think from the way they're written, Tan preferred writing these as well. They're stronger, more lyrical than the modern daughters' stories.<br /><br />And thus one down in my China Rican reading month.

I feel like I should point out his knowledge on the topic is only slightly more developed than mine by whatever. I asked him what month he wanted and he picked June because it's warm out and that is all it takes to declare that month yours.<br /><br />I never hoped to be able to find books written by China Rican authors so I settled for books written by either Chinese or Puerto Rican authors. Then I expanded it to include books written by Chinese-Americans or Puerto Ricans living in the US. Or books about those locations even if the author isn't from there. With the help of some fellow book bloggers I have a fantastic list of Chinese books, more than I'll ever get to this month but that are making it on my regular TBR list. Puerto Rican authors have been much harder to come by. I found a couple books and have them on my list but hopefully another will show up and I'll have some variety.<br /><br />I'm starting with Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club because I already own it.

I joked in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/his-first-reaction-to-unplanned-and\">my last post about the book</a> that in the first 116 pages, nothing really happened. Nothing in terms of action anyway. And I said how that was OK because I loved the characters King was introducing me to. What I didn't mention was that I came to that appreciation after I had already gotten to the point of loving the characters. In the beginning, I had trouble getting into the story. I didn't yet care about the characters, there was no action to draw me in and I hadn't bothered to learn anything about the story. And the length of the book, while not the longest ever, is still just over 600 pages and long books tend to intimidate me anyway.<br /><br />gPossible spoilers.<br />But obviously, I did make it past those first pages and then the story grabbed me and held on. The story deals with aliens and an alien infection and government cover-up but of course, the characters make the story. And in this case it's the childhood friendship of the main characters: Pete, Beaver, Henry, Jonsey and their heart, their dreamcatcher, Duddits. Duddits has Down Syndrome, which gives him this childlike simplicity, without limiting him to a child's understanding, that is sweet and heartbreaking and beautiful. It could have easily moved into cliches at this point, and King is certainly not immune to them, but Duddits manages to be a complete, round character. Duddits manages to be a center<br /><br />Standing in opposition to Duddits' pure love is Kurtz, the general (?) in charge of containing the grayboys and their Ripley virus. His mission is to make it like they, both the aliens and his men, were never there. Neither the containing of the aliens nor the cover up seem particularly unusual in an alien conspiracy. It's what's expected and the reasoning is sound. It's hard to argue that an alien fungus should not be contained and that it is of the utmost important that those who are infected are not able to infect other people. This is war and war is hell. But Kurtz goes to another level. He shows no empathy, he's unpredictable and everything he does is an act, honed to cultivate a certain image. He's an awful human being, but he's a lot of fun to read. It's just another compliment to King's ability to create believable, interesting characters. They can be the embodiment of love, of hate or just something in between, and they're fun to read.<br /><br />There is one other part of the book that I loved: the representation of Jonesy's memories. I don't want to go into the details but a warehouse of files with everything Jonsey ever knew and his safety office was fantastic. I (almost) want to see the movie just to see how they do those scenes.<br />Spoilers contained<br /><br />I was considering seeing the movie version right after reading this. I don't remember too much about it when it came out other than Jason Lee was in it and, begin from NJ, I'm a fan of his from the various Kevin Smith films he's showed up in. Normally, I'll hold off on reading a movie review until I've seen the movie. I know that sounds a little backwards but other than seeing a general movie score (however many starts Ebert gave it and the Rotten Tomatoes score) I'd rather go into a movie fresh. This time, for whatever reason, I decided to read Ebert's review. It's not positive, but to be honest it sounds like something I would expect to happen with a story like this.<br /><br />If anyone has seen the movie, let me know if I should check it out or avoid it!<br /><br />Title quote from page 454<br /><br />King, Stephen.

Most recently he's posed <a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2011/05/eight-questions-about-state-and-future.html\">Eight Questions about the State and Future of Book Blogging</a> and figured I like my opinions so I'll post my responses. And I'll post them on my in own blog rather than the comments for a couple reasons: it's what everyone else is doing (blogging peer pressure!), I don't want to have this giant comment with a lot of my rambling taking up his blog space, and then selfishly I can have another post up here and thus (maybe) drive more traffic here. So there you go: blogging is a lot like high school. Please don't ask me to finish that analogy though. I'm done intro-rambling, so now onto the questions<br /><br />1. What does book blogging do best?<br />Book blogging offers a casual way to review and discuss books, without the pretentious trappings of some of the established reviewers in publications like NYTimes or academic papers. Not to say either of those are bad or should be done away with, but they already have their place and book blogging is the amateur's response to wanting something different.<br />2. If you write a book blog, why do you?<br />I started my blog after I complained one too many times to Boyfriend that my English degree was being wasted and he suggest I start writing. He'd been suggesting I write some fiction for awhile, but that seemed so daunting after not writing anything other than emails for so long. He suggested a blog and I like books so I went with that. I started the blog initially as a means to drive discussion about books, like a reading group online but that never really worked out so I moved into discussing bookish things and discuss/reviewing books as I'm reading them.<br />3. What do you think the future of book blogging is?<br />Book blogging seems to be growing and certain blogs gaining the popularity/legitimacy (whichever publisher's go for) to have author's reaching out to blogs for book reviews. I'm sure this means more blogs will be taken over by publishing houses or just in general become \"respected\" reviewers, like those I mentioned in question 1. Essentially becoming traditional media instead of social media. But enough blogs, even those very popular ones with lots of quality reviews, will remain within the social sphere. At least I hope this will be the case. Awesome blogs, please don't leave me with the I-post-nothing-but-memes crowd.<br />4. What do your favorite book bloggers do?<br />My favorite blogs have well thought out, engaging, interesting posts that are either reviews or a discussion about some book-related topic. Some do take part in the memes (they can be fun) but they don't make it the primary point of their blog. And because they're a blog, the tone is conversational, it's casual and my favorites are usually funny or at least make me smile. If I read a book review from one of my favorite bloggers, I feel like I'm getting a book recommendation from a friend instead of a reviewer. <br />5. If you could tell all book bloggers one thing, what would it be?<br />When you post things that you don't care about because you think it will get you more traffic, your readers can tell. And then they'll leave and you'll have a bunch of readers that are following you because of stuff you don't even care about. Quit it. Write about what you care about in a way that will reach the audience you want and ignore the followers number.<br />6. If you could change one thing about book blogging, what would it be?<br />Book blogging is so diverse, I don't know that there's anything I'd change about it overall. I don't read the reviews that just consist of \"ZOMG I loved this book sooooooo much and you should go out and read it right now kthxbai\" but I suppose other people do so I won't start wishing those away. I don't like the all-memes, all-the-time blogs, but again, they have an audience so if that's what they want, go for it. There are quality book blogs out there, even if I have to do some searching to find them and I'm happy that you can find pretty much any genre or tone you want. <br />7. How do you think book blogging fits into the reading landscape?<br />For me personally, blogging has expanded what I read. I've challenged myself more than I think I would if I wasn't blogging, reading classics alongside Christopher Moore and Bill Bryson. There are so many different reading challenges out there that I'm not necessarily taking part of, but plenty of people seem to that open up new works that may have gone untouched if the reader wasn't given this little push from the blogging world.<br />8. What about your own book blogging would you like to do better/differently?<br />I want to improve my own reviewing or discussion topics. I want to dig deeper into the text of a book and put more time into the posts I write. Sometimes I rush through posts and I'm sure they could use another editing pass or two before I thrust them upon the public. I like posting a couple times a week and I'm also lazy, hence the superficiality of some of the posts.  <br />If you have have opinions on these questions, and I'm sure you do, you should post your answers and head over to The Reading Ape to let him know.<br /><br />Rhymes make me giggle.<br /><br />The title of this post gets the song \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IFVEztrwBM\">Why Rock?\" by The Aquabats</a> stuck in my head, which is why I chose it. Why do we blog? (Blog!) Why not? I think I need more sleep. Or coffee.<br /><br />Updated to make easier to match question with the answer.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:50+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:50+00:00","published_at":"2011-05-25T15:12:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e6e5dde2223b6000157","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Blogging question","slug":"blogging-question","url":"/articles/tags/blogging-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e6f5dde2238670002c0","title":"World Book Night & a free book","slug":"world-book-night-and-a-free-book","url":"/articles/world-book-night-and-a-free-book","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WBN2012.jpg\" />Have you heard of <a href=\"http://worldbooknight.org/\">World Book Night</a> before? I hadn't until sometime at the end of March when I had the opportunity to join in, courtesy of Birdie over at <a href=\"http://featherednest-birdie.blogspot.com/\">Birdie's Nest</a>. World Book Night, at least the small part of it I'm taking part in, is a way to share books and see how they travel across the globe. Birdie mentioned the author Muriel Spark as someone to read, I commented that she sounded interesting (<a href=\"http://featherednest-birdie.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-ten-tuesday-authors-who-deserve.html\">She writes books with sharp, sly humour, but they also engage important issues and have excellent characterization</a>) and Birdie responded that she just happened to have a copy of one of Spark's books, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, as part of World Book Night and did I want to be the next recipient? Free book? Hell yes!<br /><br />Now I have a new book sitting on my TBR pile, which I'll get to as soon as I'm done with <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/his-first-reaction-to-unplanned-and\">King's Dreamcatcher</a>. Only a portion of this post was meant to be me bragging about free book and telling you about World Book Night. The rest of it is to ask, who wants in on this next? All you have to do is register the book when you receive it, so we can see where the book has gone and then send it along to another person once you're done. I haven't read the book yet, so I can't tell you if it's amazing, meh or terrible. Instead <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Miss-Jean-Brodie-Novel/dp/0061711292/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306332498&amp;sr=8-1\">here's a link</a> to the Amazon page for it.  If you're interested just let me know. If more than one person is interested I'll throw names into a hat or something to pick a random person.

This also meant that I should probably hold off reading ebooks for a little while, and hopefully save some money by reading some of the actual books I have lying around the house. And thus I decided to pick up Dreamcatcher by Stephen King. I've been dragging this book around with me for years. My dad had given it to me as a birthday gift when I was in high school. I had forgotten when he gave it to me until a birthday card fell out of the front of the book. I apparently hadn't even opened the book in awhile. It's not that I didn't want to read it. It's just that it's a hardcover book and recently reading this has just reconfirmed how much I dislike reading hardback books. Luckily the book is making it worth it.<br /><br />I haven't come close to reading the full King catalogue, but I have read a number of his books and have run the gamut from some of my favorite reads (Misery, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor\">the short story \"1408\"</a>) to some very meh titles (It). I didn't know what to expect with this one. To be honest I didn't know what it was about when I started it. I didn't even bother to read the blurb about the book until a few pages ago (I'm up to page 250 now). I figured that whatever King had in store, a blurb might describe the basic plot but isn't going to tell me if I'll enjoy it or not.  The plot is only a small part of a King story, and I've discovered with him it's better to just dive right in. <br /><br />King's forte is coming up with some great characters. Not characters you want to hang out with, not characters you particularly admire, but characters you feel like you know, you feel like you can connect with even if you don't want to. When I was around page 116 I was joking with Boyfriend that I could probably sum up everything that had happened thus far in the book in 4 sentences. If you wanted just plot points, those 116 pages held very little in terms of action. However, this isn't a condemnation of the writing. In fact, when the action did start to pick up I actually wished for the story to go back to just the characters. I wanted to learn more and more about their flawed lives. There are no <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue\">Mary Sue</a> characters in King's world. (Stephanie Meyers, please take note.) He creates characters that you can feel pity for, be proud of, get angry at and most importantly, be interested in.<br /><br />King puts his characters through the extremes, in this case extraterrestrials. (I was going to say spoiler alert but then I realized it mentions this ins the blurb. So if you're angry at me for not giving a spoiler warning, blame the blurb writer.) The focus isn't entirely on the action, on the weird stuff but instead so much of the story is how the characters react. What will they do? How will they deal with the craziness? And so much of the book so far has involved flashbacks to the main characters' childhood that I'm currently still trying to piece together how it fits in with the story I'm reading now. I trust everything will come together. King doesn't show all his cards all at once and slowly more and more is revealed.<br /><br />I'm about a third of the way through so there will be at least one more post. I'm excited to see what will happen next, how everyone will react to the outside forces and to one another. King is a writer for the masses that gives you a story that sticks with you, gives you something to think about and Dreamcatcher is proving to be on the better end of the King spectrum. Not only can I not wait to read more of this but I'm adding some more King to my TBR list.<br /><br />I think I say this a lot. I'm always planning on doing one thing and then I just end up doing something else. I should probably quit planning on things.<br /><br />Title quote from page 64<br /><br />King, Stephen.

The title of this book made me stop and pick it up. I saw it sitting on one of the tables laid out at a book store that seem to always hide all of the books I'm looking for. And just look at the cover: Barbie collectors in drag, Barney Fife look-a-like, not one but two people dressed in sci-fi ensembles (I think both Star Trek but I'm not sure and don't want to draw their ire) and a furry. A furry, people. As a fan of shows like Taboo (it doesn't count as reality TV if it's on NatGeo, right?), I was intrigued. A Personal Journey into the Heart of Fanatical Passion in America? Sold. Done. Let's see what this has to offer.<br /><br /><br /><br />I've read this book a few times. It's a fairly quick read. It's an easy read. I don't think I've ever had to put the book down so I could deeply contemplate what I'd just read. But the book has kept me coming back whenever I'm not quite sure what to read next, but I know I want to be reading something. It's nice to see someone who has hobbies are so completely different from my own. Shari begins her journey because she's never had an all-consuming passion and she wants to understand what draws people to these hobbies? Is there something all of these people, from pigeon racers to extreme boardgamers have in common?  Is Shari missing something? So she finds Meetup.com and begins attending conventions and chasing tornadoes to try to find these answers.<br /><br /><br /><br />At one point I was reading this around my aunt. She asked me what it was about and I told her about the different groups Shari visits. My aunt was laughing at how ridiculous people could be until I mentioned the Josh Groban chapter. Suddenly, the laughter stopped. I wouldn't classify my aunt as a fanatical fan (she's yet to mortgage her house to see him perform) but she's certainly a fan. It's all fun and games until something you like gets its own \"fanatical\" chapter.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, Shari's never hurtful or condescending towards the people she meets and their hobbies. OK, sometimes she is but she generally owns up to it and changes tone quickly. She's often jealous that they have something they can throw themselves so completely in. She says: \"I was searching for some kind of silly, shameless joy, something to give my life color and dimension, something I could go gaga over and not care that people actually used the word gaga when describing me\" (14). Sure there are some things I don't think she'll ever really understand. And I'm with her. I don't think I'll ever really understand <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk_music\">filking</a>g but I can point it out when I see it now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Alright, so she doesn't really come out with exact and proven answers for her questions. But this isn't an official sociological study about subcultures and their motivations, it's a fun piece of work that let's you peek into another world and maybe gets you to consider checking out a group that shares your interests. Hell, that might be why I picked it up in the first place.<br /><br /><br /><br />On top of the voyeuristic nature of the book, I was probably drawn to it because I never felt like I had an all-consuming hobby. Boyfriend has sports, especially baseball. He works in sports, he spends a good amount of his day watching games or following sports news and will probably have a sports blog going up soon (something I will totally be plugging here, although I probably won't visit all that often) and one of his favorite ways to spend a nice day is Central Park Baseball. I never had a hobby like that. Maybe that's what this blog has become? Perhaps not quite to the degree of the fanatics Shari meets with, but certainly along those lines. I started writing this post assuming I was in the same hobby-less world as when I first picked up the book.

Dick's short story \"The Adjustment Team\" after seeing the movie based on it, The Adjustment Bureau. I feel like the movie showed up and disappeared without making much of a splash, but I really liked it. Maybe the mixture of sci fi and romance wasn't really what anyone was expecting. Admittedly just the fact that Sterlingg is in it made me want to see it or at least see what it was about. I'm easily swayed. It's a story of predestination and free will and one man who sees behind the curtain. When I found out Philip K. Dick wrote the short story, I decided I needed to check this out.<br /><br />This will kind of include spoilers. Unless you saw any trailers of the movie. In which case, nothing will be ruined by reading what's below. That's just how movie trailers roll<br />Ed Fletcher was supposed to make it to work early this morning but the Summoner fell back asleep instead of, well, summoning and instead Ed is late to work. Now he's not part of the adjustment, he walks in during the middle of it. His office building and all of his fellow office workers are grey and crumble as if they're made of ash. Ed notices a group of men dressed all in white dragging an odd contraption with them. He flees the building, not sure what he saw. His wife tries to convince him that he's had a psychotic episode. He can't stand to be back at his office and see all the small changes everywhere and wanders the city when the men in white appear to explain the \"adjustment\" process to him. They will let him be, but he cannot tell anyone what he knows, and he must convince his wife that there was nothing to what he claims to have seen and it was just an episode.<br />Spoilers contained<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Adjustment+Bureau.jpg\" /><br />I love the premise of the story. The story is (very) short, but it gets you asking questions: How much free will do we have?  Is the free will we have real or an illusion? Why would there need to be \"adjusters\"? What is real? Actually, the story is so short it gets you asking questions without even making an attempt to answer them or even point you in a direction. It just poses them and then off it goes, while you flounder to understand the implications. I suppose this is a good thing in a short story and would have been a great thing had I not already seen the movie. Obviously a full length movie needs to flesh out this premise. While reading all I wanted to do was have more of the story. The little Kindle percentage counter flew by so quickly. I wanted to find out more about the adjusters, about Ed, about what Ed's new knowledge would mean to him, even if he couldn't share it with anyone. If I hadn't seen the movie I think this story would have sat with me, poked me, prodded me for awhile. I think I would have been thrilled with the movie that took the basic plot idea from the story and ran with it. But I did it backwards, and thus I'm left wanting more from the story. I don't need a novelization of the movie, but I wished Dick had originally written more.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie and liked it, I tentatively recommend the story. If you haven't seen the movie but are intrigued, read the story first. It's very short and will take you an hour, tops.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'll read next, but I think some more Philip K. Dick is getting added to my TBR list. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? perhaps?<br /><br />Sterling from Mad Men, aka John Slattery. I have a hard time now picturing him in non-1960s clothes.

I can't think of another way to start this post than to say I loved this book. I'm a Tina Fey fan so I certainly didn't think I was going to hate Bossypants but I'm not a huge fan of memoirs, especially celebrity ones. When I first heard about the book I thought \"That's nice. Maybe I'll borrow this from someone one day.\" But then I'd hear more and more about it, I'd read excerpts here and there, I saw her on Conan and the more I heard the more I thought I needed to read this sooner. And I got my opportunity while sitting at JFK airport waiting for what turned out to be a broken plane to show up. Oh the joys of flying.<br /><br />Bossypants details Fey's foray into comedy, from her time at Summer Showtime as a teen, her time in the improv group The Second City, and of course her writing on SNL and her work on 30 Rock. That's expected, you had to know this is what you'd be getting with this book. What surprised me, and also Ilevinso at <a href=\"http://femalebookreader.blogspot.com/2011/05/feminist-book-alert.html\">Sarcastic Female Literary Circle</a>, is how strongly feminist this book isg. It's hard being a female in the male dominated comedy circle and Fey doesn't skirt around the issue. She addresses it head on with her signature wit:<br /><blockquote>In 1995, each cast at The Second City was made up of four men and two women. When it was suggested that they switch one of the companies to three men and three women, the producers and directors had the same panicked reaction. \"You can't do that. There won't be enough parts to go around. There won't be enough for the girls.\" This made no sense to me, probably because I speak English and have never had a head injury. (Location 922)</blockquote>Her rants at the sexism within the industry don't make up the majority of the text, but since those were my favorite parts and this is my blog, I'm going to share another one with you, especially because it makes me like Amy Poehler that much more:<br /><blockquote>Amy was in the middle of some such nonsense [comedy bit] with Seth Meyers across the table, and she did something vulgar as a joke. I can't remember what it was exactly, except it was dirty and loud and \"unladylike.\" Jimmy Fallon, who was arguably the star of the show at the time, turned to her and in a faux-squeamish voice said, \"Stop that! It's not cute! I don't like it.\" Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him. \"I don't fucking care if you like it.\"...With that exchange, a cosmic shift took place. Amy made it clear that she wasn't there to be cute. She wasn't there to play wives and girlfriends in the boys' scenes. (location 1514)</blockquote>I could go on and on just sharing quotes from this because it is consistently hilarious, whether she's talking about her (lack of) fashion sense, her badass dad, her disastrous honeymoon cruise, her 30 Rock writing team, Loren Michaels, or her own adventures in breast feeding. Everything is a gem. I can't say I learned more about myself. I think I learned more about comedy writing, such as male comedy writers tend to pee in cups and leave them around the office. Valuable lesson. I couldn't put this book down and read it through at least half of my brother's college graduation ceremony. And yes, I'm sure I was getting dirty looks from the people around me for not paying attention, but there are something like a million kids graduating at once, and it took an hour alone for them to just walk in. Seriously. 9:20 procession starts. 10:30 graduation ceremony begins. Just look at the picture. And that's not even all the grads. I couldn't fit them all in frame.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/IMAG0043.jpg\" /><br />This is a fantastic read and one I'm absolutely putting my on re-read pile for when I need to read something light and funny. A general reading pick-me-up. <br /><br />Side note, there are a couple footnotes in the book, which I missed because I was reading on a Kindle. I was going to complain about that and how hard it is to figure out how to get to the note when reading the ebook, except I just learned you can click on the asterisk and it will take you right to that note. Then hit Back to go right back to the page you were on. Well played, Kindle.<br /><br />Title quote 1267<br /><br />I was thinking of trying to mitigate this statement here so as to not scare of those that see the word feminist and flee. But you know what? if that's your reaction to the word \"feminist\", bite me.<br /><br />Fey, Tina. Bossypants. Reagan Authur Books, 2011.

This week's topic is jerky literary characters, a companion list to the earlier <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/why-i-need-to-learn-some-german\">mean girls topic</a>, which I totally failed at. Of course that's not stopping me from trying to come up with some this week, especially because I've still yet to write anything for Bossypants. I was going to but instead I ended up playing Luigi's Mansion last night. Don't worry, joke's on me because I don't have any memory cards so it was a bunch of wasted time.  Onto the list:<br /><br />1. Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte - I've <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/my-future-husband-was-becoming-to-me-my\">been writing about him </a>so I don't think my choice here is a surprise. I know people love him but really, he seems like an ass to me. He's never that particularly kind to Jane and he seems to think he deserves a humanitarian award because he decided against killing someone. Sorry, I do not understand the great love for this guy.<br /><br />2. Wickham from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - I have a hard time separating out Austen and the Brontes as separate people so it's just natural I have an Austen creation next. At least Austen meant for Wickham to be an ass. He tried to ruin several reputations and left a wake of debt in his path. I guess he gets his comeuppance, seeing that he gets stuck with Lydia.<br /><br />3. Snape from the Harry Potter series by Rowling - An HP character (Umbridge) made it on my mean girls list, so it's nice to have a male equivalent. Snape may not be totally evil but he's such a jerk throughout the series, even if he wasn't actively trying to give Harry to Voldemort.<br /><br />4. Mr. Norrell from Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clark - I don't necessarily hate this guy but man, he could be such a jerk. He's a magician that just sucked all of the fun out of magic and managed to get multiple people enslaved within the fairy kingdom. Sure that may not have been his intention, but he certainly knew what was going on and just let it happen.<br /><br />That's all I've got. I keep coming up with evil characters which is stronger than this list calls for. I'm sure I've missed a number of perfect jerk characters. Who are some of your favorites?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:53+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:53+00:00","published_at":"2011-05-10T12:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e715dde2238670002cb","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e725dde2238670002cc","title":"One Book, Two Book, Red Book, Blue Book?","slug":"one-book-two-book-red-book-blue-book","url":"/articles/one-book-two-book-red-book-blue-book","body":"I was originally hoping to get my post about Tina Fey's book Bossypants up today, but I haven't started writing anything for it yet. I've been running around since Thursday, visiting friends around Boston, going to my brother's college graduation, multiple family dinners, and of course Mother's Day. This gave me reading time but not too much computer time, and thus I'm unprepared today. Then I saw this quick meme on both <a href=\"http://myreadersblock.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-meme-one-book-two-book-three-book.html\">My Reader's Block</a> and <a href=\"http://soychaibookshelf.blogspot.com/2011/05/one-book-two-book-three-book-four-and.html\">Soy Chai Bookshelf </a>and decided that was enough book blogger peer pressure for me to take part in this as well. It was originally done over at <a href=\"http://stuck-in-a-book.blogspot.com/2011/05/one-book-two-book-three-book-four-and.html\">Stuck in a Book</a>.<br /><br />1. The book I'm currently reading: Who Are You People: A Personal Journey into the Heart of Fanatical Passion in America by Shari Caudron. I've read this before and I was originally going to read it now as a light hearted choice after <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/have-you-ever-tried-to-outrun-yourself\">Rollin's Black Coffee Blues.</a> I started it, but then I ended up bringing my Kindle with me to Boston so I wouldn't have to worry about running out of books and downloaded Fey's book. I guess this means I fulfilled my lighthearted read quota, but screw it, I'm reading this one too. I haven't read about Trekkies and furries and Josh Groban fans in awhile.<br /><br />2. The last book I finished: Tina Fey's Bossypants which is was hilarious. I'll have something written about it soon. Promises.<br /><br />3. The next book I want to read: I'm not good at picking a next book. Hell, I had just picked a next book with Who Are You People and then changed it after 10 pages. I'm bad at making and sticking to plans. So tentatively speaking, I'm planning on reading Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad next. Hopefully I stick to that, because I do actually want to read it.<br /><br />4. The last book I bought: Now I feel repetitive but Bossypants. Kindle makes it dangerously easy to buy new books. I think it took all of 45 seconds to get this one.<br /><br />5. The last book I was given: Part of my Boston trip involved moving my brother out of his dorm room (super fun, I know). He took a class called science and magic or something along those lines. Anyway, he had some books that he forgot to sell back so I took them off his hands cos hey, free books. I came away with Magic in the Middle Ages by Richard Kieckhefer, Revolutionizing the Sciences by Peter Dear and Galileo's Daughterby Dava Sobel. I haven't actually heard of any of these so we'll see how this goes. My brother also had a book he had bought that he said was so boring he was falling asleep while reading it. How can you turn down a book with an endorsement like that, so I took The Dumbest Generation by Mark Bauerlein off his hands. I'm prepared to be annoyed by it. Preconceived notions, great way to go into a book!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:54+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:54+00:00","published_at":"2011-05-09T15:18:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e725dde2238670002cd","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"One Book Two Book","slug":"one-book-two-book","url":"/articles/tags/one-book-two-book"}]}]},{"id":"53224e725dde2238670002ce","title":"Have you ever tried to outrun yourself?","slug":"have-you-ever-tried-to-outrun-yourself","url":"/articles/have-you-ever-tried-to-outrun-yourself","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Black+Coffee+Blues+cover.jpg\" />A couple days ago the Tuesday Top Ten topic was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/thanks-for-making-me-read-this\">book recommendations you're glad you took</a>. Black Coffee Blues by Henry Rollins is a book recommendation I'm glad I took.<br /><br />I don't really remember how the topic came up but Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> had recommended I read some Henry Rollins and suggested I start with this one. I probably mentioned something about how I like his spoken word stuff, but I've never read anything of his. Indeed I just checked my iTunes listing and I have 134 tracks spanning 22.4 hours of Rollins spoken word. Apparently this includes Get in the Van, another Rollins recommendation from Ben.<br /><br />If you can't tell by the sheer volume I've accumulated, I like Rollins voice, his ability to tell a story. It's different than anything else I've heard and his writing really matches the tone in his spoken word stuff. Or perhaps I'm just reading it in his voice. But the subject matter of this book was not what I expected. It's so angry. So lonely. So hopeless. I expected these topics to be touched upon but they are the focus. And there's so much violence, especially against innocent people. According to the intro Rollins began work on this in the late '80s and I suppose in light of the things he's done in later years it's easy to forget a lot of the anger he carried when he was younger.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe Black Coffee Blues. Some of it is short stories, some of it are his thoughts while touring with Black Flag, some of it is poetry. It's even difficult to describe if this is fiction or non-fiction. Sometimes it's just a story, sometimes it's a dream, sometimes fact and sometimes it's a melding of all of these elements.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book, \"124 Worlds\", also contains some of the parts that disgusted me the most. \"124 Worlds\" is a series of 124 vignettes, some a sentence or two, some a few paragraphs and others a couple pages. It makes up a little more than 1/2 of the total book. These stories don't intersect, there are hardly characters in them let alone characters that show up in multiple snippets but this was the section that drew me in more than the others. I couldn't put the book down, I wanted just one more, even when I was disgusted by the unprovoked and all-consuming violence that took place within some of these worlds. Even the worlds I liked were horribly depressing, such as #30, about a boy and his awful Christmases with a resentful mother and a drunk father. With the stories it's just one thing after another and you begin to feel the weight of the stories suffocating you. Here are a few of those stories. Or at least pieces of the stories:<br /><br />#17: She has been off heroin for three months. Every day that goes by is a special day for her. It's a day that she hasn't taken drugs...It's not easy. Sometimes she feels bad and it's all she can do to hold on. Sometimes she sits on her bed and repeats, \"I don't need you. I don't need you. I don't need you.\"<br /><br />#30: ...He remembered the Christmases of his youth. He was living with his mother. She would get him some presents and never let him forget for a minute that he was a pain in her ass...He would pull the presents into his room and put them in a pile in the corner. He rarely played with the things that they bought him. He was scared to break them. She would hit him. Call him ungrateful and threaten to have the police come and take him to jail forever.<br /><br />#32: It was her third black eye in one year. She didn't freak out. She did shoot him in the back of the head while he was watching television.<br /><br />#54: He shot the guy like it was nothing. I've never seen anything like it in my life. He pulled up to the red light, got out of his car and walked over to the Plymouth and fired three shots into the driver's face. Then he got back in his car. He had the music up loud, some heavy metal garbage. I never seen anything like it! He just wasted the guy! Anyway, the light turned green and he took off, and so did everybody else except for the dead guy. I would have too, but my car stalled.<br /><br />#115: Loneliness is her friend. She lost her job today. The rent is due in two weeks. It's like a bad dream. The night comes. She drinks and wonders what she'll do.<br /><br />I don't think I'll put this on the re-read list anytime soon, but I suppose you never know. I do plan on reading some more Rollins though I'd like something later, something with more hope and less anger.<br /><br />Title quote from location 1621<br /><br />Rollins, Henry.

How do you decide what to read next? You don't want to waste your time reading crap, so how can you be sure what you select will be worth your time? Recommendations. Or more specifically, recommendations from trusted sources. Plenty of people can recommend you read something, but for a recommendation to truly have merit it's got to take the potential reader into consideration. I can, and do, recommend absurd authors all the time because they're my favorites. But if a non-fiction, American history fan were to ask me for something to read next, I probably shouldn't steer him towards my normal selections. Or suggest them with a clear description of what the reader would be getting into, along with a selection he may actually take into consideration.<br /><br />With that wordy intro, I bring us to the point of this week's Top Ten Tuesday, hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/05/jamies-top-ten-books-that-came.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>: What are some titles you may never have picked up on your own, but are very happy someone recommended them to you? I think I can actually make it to 10 with this topic!<br /><br />As with my usual top ten posts, the order of these books only reflects the order I thought of them in and not any sort of rating system.<br /><br /><br />1. Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clark - This was recommended to me long before I started blogging, by 2 of my reader friends. One of them even brought it with him when a group of us went to Ireland on spring break and there's just something about bringing a tome like this on spring break that screams \"this book is worth it\". I would only ever get vague descriptions from them followed by a \"You should read this. You'd love it.\" I'm so happy I found a copy and followed their advice. One of my favorite books.<br /><br />2. Made in America: An Informal History of the English Language in the United States by Bill Bryson - One of the Strange &amp; Norrell recommenders lent me his copy of this book to read and I've been hooked on Bryson since. Language history told with humor, it has made me very happy.<br /><br />3. The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde - Another favorite of mine and it is a recommendation. In this case the recommendation came from my mom's boyfriend's daughter, who read it for her book club. She liked the book but not enough to read the rest of the series. I, on the other hand, I found a new favorite author.<br /><br />3. Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore - Another favorite author. I apparently cannot find favorite authors on my own. They must be given to me. Moore was actually recommended to me by two different people. My one friend told me how much he loved this author Moore and apparently each time I would just smile and nod. Because really, in my defense, that friend is getting his PhD in a very specific subset of American History and I figured our choices didn't meld. (Also if you're wondering, he's not the friend I was thinking of in the intro. Apparently \"American History buff\" is a specific friend demographic I'm cultivating.) Eventually a co-worker of mine forced me to read Lamb. I apologized to my friend when he starting going on about how he'd been telling me about how awesome Moore is. But really, even our Moore tastes don't line up: he loves Island of the Sequined Love Nun which is near the bottom of my I-Love-Moore list.<br /><br />4. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly by Anthony Bourdain - My \"Made in America\" and \"Strange &amp; Norrell\" friend is back with another recommendation. I really miss living with him because then I had these great book recommendations all the time. That and good food. Bourdain gives a humorous and sometimes upsetting view of the restaurant world as he knows it and it's an excellent read for someone who loves food or who at least finds Bourdain entertaining. My friend loves both these things and on top of being lent a bunch of fantastic books, I used to come home from work to find things like freshly baked madeleines or crab cakes waiting for me while my friend tried out some new recipe.<br /><br />5. The Harry Potter series by JK Rowling - Here's how my personal discovery of HP went. I was going to study in Italy and wanted to bring some English language books with me. But I didn't want to buy anything because I anticipated spending plenty of money overseas. My brother had a copy of the first HP book that he never read so I chucked that into my bag. I finished this and the other books at my disposal, so while perusing the English language section at the Stazione Termini bookstore I found an inexpensive copy of Chamber of Secrets and read that. And then I put down HP and didn't think about it for awhile. Skip ahead and Boyfriend, another friend and I are going to spend the day at the beach. The final HP book just came out and my friend is a big fan. She wanted someone to share the experience with, so she lent me the 3rd book. I learned I really do not mix well with sun and that even multiple applications of SPF70 are not enough to keep me from turning into a lobster, from my neck to the backs of my knees. I spent a few days laying on my stomach trying not to move, which gave me plenty of reading time. I had the 4th book (also my brother's, also unread) in my possession so I finished these and was eager to carry on with the series. Luckily a month or so later I moved in with beach friend and she, of course, had the entire series for me to borrow.<br /><br />6. World War Z by Max Brooks - This surprisingly was a book recommendation from my brother. Surprisingly cos he does not read. Actually the mere fact that he doesn't read and the fact that he was searching for and enjoyed this book made me want to read it all the more. Zombie nightmares aside, I was very happy with this one.<br /><br />7. Special Topics in Calamity Physics by Marisha Pessl - Another friend shows up again with a fun book recommendation. This recommendation came from he who brought Strange &amp; Norrell with him to Ireland and this was actually a surprise recommendation. He sent me a package that had a book I had lent him (Galapagos by Vonnegut), a book our friend had lent him I wanted to read (The City &amp; The City by Mielville) and then this surprise book. Love a surprise book.<br /><br />8. Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer - Lest you think I only take book recommendations from people I've actually met (and who can lend me copies of their books) I also look to the book blogging community for an idea on what to read next. Brenna from <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2010/11/extremely-loud-incredibly-close.html\">Literary Musing</a> had a fantastic review of this book, and I just had to read it. I'm very happy I listened to her.<br /><br />9. This Is Where I Leave You by Jonathan Tropper - Another book read because I liked what a book blogger had to say about it. In this case it was Greg from <a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/2009/11/two-reviews-troppers-family-antics-and.html\">The New Dork Review</a> that made me want to pick up this book. Hell, he starts the review with \"[This book] is, simply put, one of the best books I've read this year\" and then describes it as \"edgy, witty and fantastically hilarious.\"  Done and done.<br /><br />10. Room by Emma Donoghue - This wasn't recommended by an individual so much as everyone seemed to be reading it and talking about it, including bloggers I trusted, so I had to see what was going on. That and I got a copy from a friend, which makes things even easier. This is absolutely a book I wouldn't have bothered to pick up had it not been recommended by so many people. It's not my favorite book but I'm so glad I read it.<br /><br />I didn't want to add this one to the list because I haven't finished it yet, but I'm currently reading Black Coffee Blues by Henry Rollins on the recommendation of Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a>. The book recommendations continue on!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:55+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:55+00:00","published_at":"2011-05-03T12:15:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e735dde2238670002d3","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e735dde2238670002d4","title":"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel","slug":"women-are-supposed-to-be-very-calm-generally-but-women-feel-just-as-men-feel","url":"/articles/women-are-supposed-to-be-very-calm-generally-but-women-feel-just-as-men-feel","body":"I finished Jane Eyre this weekend and, for those who were worried after <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/my-future-husband-was-becoming-to-me-my\">my last post</a>, I did not end up hating the book. I didn't love it, I haven't found a new favorite, but I enjoyed it and I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />gAs with the others, this will contain spoilers. Heads up<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Jane+Eyre.png\" />Jane redeems herself for her earlier weakness when she refuses to marry St. John Rivers. Initially she can't say no to St. John's requests, even though she says she doesn't want to listen to him. She never gives sufficient reason for why she felt she had to listen to him, his sisters wouldn't take part in his studies, but nevertheless, she is obedient. This is a good set up to the surprise for the reader and St. John when she refuses his marriage proposals, but I wanted to know more from Jane about why she couldn't refuse him before. She was articulate about why she wouldn't marry him, she stayed strong, she never became overly emotional,  and she never got angry with St. John. It was a this point that Jane's independence and strength shone. And it was with this that her return to Rochester worked.<br /><br />The feminist in me was disappointed with two points in Jane's return to Rochester: her happily ever after is wrapped up in her marriage and that Rochester had to be physically maimed in order for the two of them to actually be equals. I have to remind constantly remind myself that for the time Bronte was writing this, when she couldn't even sign her own name because people would never read something by a woman, this was making great strides in feminism. And yet I felt like the relationship with Lizzie and Darcy was equal without all of the complications Bronte went through for her lovers.<br /><br />While I say I like the story, I can't say I ever started to really like Rochester. Not only is he not particularly nice to Jane while she's living at Thornfield, although Bronte managed to make his love for her genuine, but he locks up his wife Bertha which can't have helped her sanity. I know we're supposed to think he's so good and kind because he doesn't kill her when he leaves Jamaica, but I don't know that deciding not to murder someone necessarily makes the person super great. Divorce may not be an option and his situation may be unfair, but I don't want to like a character based on pity. But Rochester is far better than passive aggressive St. John Rivers, who needs  to quit dragging our last name through the mud by being such a jerk. I think I may have hated him slightly more because of our shared surname.<br />Spoilers above.<br /><br /><br />I'm happy I finally read this one. I'm considering re-reading The Eyre Affair to see if I now get any of the subtle Jane Eyre jokes I missed when I was a Bronte virgin. But I don't plan on putting Jane Eyre on my re-read list. However, I think I'll give Emily a shot with Wuthering Heights...at some point. I need a little break from them for now.<br /><br />Title quote from location 1999<br /><br />Bronte, Charlotte.

My intention isn't to provoke a reaction, but rather record my own. I of course welcome comments and love the discussion they drive, but I just want to make it clear I'm not doing this to cause some stir and thus drive up any traffic numbers. This is also going to be all kinds of full of spoilers so you should skip this if you haven't read Jane Eyre. Here goes<br /><br />I'm suddenly understanding why Meyers kept talking about how awesome Jane Eyre was in the Twilight series, because the current conversations/actions between Jane and Rochester are sounding more and more like the relationship between Bella and Edward. What the hell???<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Jane+Eyre+red+room.jpg\" />I'm at the point where Rochester has proposed to Jane and they're going to get married in a month. At this part Jane's self-esteem seems so low that she's decided \"he must not actually like me all this much, so I'm going to see if I can piss him off to the point where he breaks off this engagement.\" Obviously this is up for interpretation, but that is how I'm reading this. For example<br /><br /><blockquote>I assured him I was naturally hard -- very flinty, and that he would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort of bargain he had made, while there was time to rescind it. (location 5158)</blockquote>I get the idea behind what Jane's doing. Mrs. Fairfax told her to be wary, so wary she's being. Or she thinks she's being. Because really it's coming off as someone who is just being whiny and \"I'm so awful, clearly this isn't real and he's going to regret his decision so I better make him regret it now while he still has time to bail\". Jane seemed so much stronger before. I like her trying to show she's an equal by keeping her position as governess and keeping a salary from Rochester and she'll pay for her things with that, but even that comes off as odd. He's going to be her husband and employer? That doesn't make it sound like an equal relationship at all.<br /><br />And Rochester is pissing me off too. Jane refuses to see Rochester regularly during these 4 weeks and will only see him when he calls for her during this specific time in the evening. During that time she doesn't want to talk to him, cos you certainly can't get to know someone by talking to them, so she comes up with other stuff to distract him with. On night she asks him to sing instead. She tries to play along on the piano but Rochester kicks her off of it cos she sucks so much. Granted, she says this is what she was hoping would happen, but it doesn't say that she was trying to play badly. Instead she was trying to play correctly but she was just so bad (obviously) that he couldn't stand it.<br /><blockquote>I did try [to play the accompaniment], but was presently swept off the stool and denominated \"a little bungler.\" Being pushed unceremoniously to one side -- which was precisely what I wished -- he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself (location 5126)</blockquote>Maybe this is all meant to be playful. Maybe I'm reading it the wrong way. But I have to say, I may be wrong but I 'm think reading this the same way Meyers did. The only difference is where I'm going \"The hell is going on??\" Meyers went \"This is the ultimate love story, except it needs sparkles.\" But here's the passage that made me put the book down and start writing this:<br /><blockquote>He continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as \"love\" and \"darling\" on his lips: the best words at my service were \"provoking puppet,\" \"malicious elf,\" \"sprite,\" \"changeling,\" etc. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: a present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. (location 5177)</blockquote>Someone please tell me I've read this wrong and this isn't the beginning of an abusive relationship. Or maybe Jane's just into S&amp;M? But seriously, I'm getting a little worried about this girl. Especially when she says \"my future husband was becoming to me my whole world\" (location 5180).<br /><br />Before these scenes Jane was kind of dull, but not low self-esteem whiny. And after these scenes she seems fine again. So what was going on? I get that it was a different time and maybe I'm reading too much into this but can someone then explain to me what I should get getting out of this?<br /><br />Title quote from location 5180<br /><br />Bronte, Charlotte.

Unfortunately, I'm having trouble coming up with...well really any characters other than the ones below. I can think of characters I didn't like but they don't quite fit the snotty, nice-to-your face, back handedness this topic really calls for.  I thought I'd expand the meaning to refer to anyone with a backfeifengesicht, which (according to <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_17251_the-10-coolest-foreign-words-english-language-needs.html\">Cracked</a> anyway) is German for \"a face badly in need of a fist\" and if I could even begin to pronounce that I would use it every day.

I really like that word backfeifengesicht and wanted to make sure more people know it.<br /><br />Here are the only 2 I could honestly come up with that fit either definition. I've hated other characters or thought they were evil villains and whatnot, but they've never elicited the reaction this topic calls for.<br /><br />Caroline Bingley from Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - She is perfect for this list. The little remarks, the backhanded compliments, fawning over Darcy while pretending to care about Jane. As soon as I heard the topic I came up with her instantly and thought the rest of the list would be just as easy. Oh how wrong I was.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by JK Rowling - She's really borderline for this list and only because she pretends to be nice at times, with her smiles and those weird kitten decorations and all the pink does she get considered. She makes it because every time she did that little cough I wanted someone, anyone to smack her. Or hand her a cough drop or something.<br /><br />That is all I've got. I hope you guys were more successful in this list. Now I'm going to go Google a pronunciation guide for backfeifengesicht.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:56+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:56+00:00","published_at":"2011-04-26T13:22:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e745dde22fdcf00053c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e755dde2223b600015a","title":"Restlessness was in my nature","slug":"restlessness-was-in-my-nature","url":"/articles/restlessness-was-in-my-nature","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Jane+Eyre+cover.jpg\" />I'm finally getting around to reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. You'd think I would have been shamed into reading this one sooner. I've gone on ad naseum about how much I love the Thursday Next series which begins with the book The Eyre Affair. And if you can't figure it out from the name, Jane Eyre plays a pretty large role in the book, with characters from Jane Eyre interacting with Thursday and Thursday actually jumping into Charlotte's masterpiece and becoming part of the story. While I have no doubt I missed many subtle jokes because I wasn't already familiar with the Bronte piece, it never bothered me enough to actually pick up the book. After my success with Pride and Prejudice I figured I could read some of the other literature of roughly that era.g Yet I was still apprehensive. Perhaps it's the social norms of the time, so uptight and prude, that makes me back away slowly. But I gave in and besides, it's a free copy for my Kindle, which certainly makes reading the classics easier.<br /><br />I haven't finished Jane Eyre yet. Actually, I'm only 36% of the way done (yeah Kindle!) but I wanted to get my initial thoughts out there. Jane's just made it to Thornfield, but I've lost reading steam since she got there. I really liked the early chapters of Jane at Mrs. Reed's and Jane at Lowood. I had assumed I'd get a story of a kid who is good and perfect and obedient and yet is constantly berated and tormented and you feel nothing but pity for her. Thankfully that's not what Bronte provides. Jane is certainly mistreated by Mrs. Reed and her kids but she's not meek and mild, just a character to pity. When Mrs. Reed tells her kids Jane is \"not worthy of notice\" and that they shouldn't associate with her, Jane yells down \"They are not fit to associate with me\" (location 431). That's not a meek kid, that's not a kid you just pity. When she finds out she's going to leave Mrs. Reed's and go to Lowood school, Jane lets Mrs. Reed have it<br /><blockquote>I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you worst of anybody in the world except John Reed...I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if anyone asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty. (location 604-611)</blockquote>A few spoilers below. I already knew most of this before reading and it hasn't ruined the story for me, but if you're worried<br />I miss that spark from Jane because so far while at Thornfield it hasn't shown itself. She's been kind and good and not taken advantage of but she's just kind of bland right now. There's a crazy lady, laughing maniacally and setting people on fire, and Jane's just very eh. She's trying to figure out what's going on, but so far she's been so quiet. Plus Rochester is kind of an ass and not in the fun way Darcy was so I don't get why he's supposed to be the great love interest.<br /><br />I wish there was another Helen Burns, Jane's friend from Lowood, at Thornfield. I couldn't help but think of Luna Lovegood from the Harry Potter series when I read her character. Something about the daydreaming while being punished for whatever small infraction she had committed and not getting angry at anyone. Knowing death was on her heels made her more forgiving, more relaxed and she dealt with it in a way that was years beyond her age. Perhaps I dislike the chapters after her death because I miss her. I'm holding that against subsequent chapters and should probably just get over it.<br />Spoilers contained. You're safe now<br /><br />Here's to hoping things pick up in the story. So many people list this among their favorite, desert island reads, so I'm sure there is something of substance and intrigue here to latch on to.<br /><br />Wikipedia just told me Austen is part of the Regency era and Bronte isn't but I think of them as one in the same.<br /><br />Title quote from location 1992<br /><br />Bronte, Charlotte.

At least it's probably his birthday today. For those uneducated in the minutia of Shakespeare (a.k.a. non-super nerds), the only record is that Shakespeare was baptized on April 26th, 1564. Traditionally a person was baptized 3 days after birth, hence April 23rd for his birthday. Plus he died on April 23rd in 1616 so it makes it easier to remember these dates if they're all the same.<br /><br />In what is becoming a tradition here on holidays, I figure I'd link to some past posts I've written about Shakespeare.

I started the book sometime back in March and expected it to take about a week, maybe more. But no, that was not to be. The book is divided into the ages of Jacques' speech from As You Like It and after making it through the intro and the Infant, I was drained. There is so much dry, Elizabethan history to make it through that I needed a break. And so I've been reading an age in this book and then switching to a different book, repeat, repeat until Soul of the Age is done.<br /><br />Here's the thing; the book isn't bad. I'd like to think if it was just awful I wouldn't have put myself through it. It was dry at points (a lot of points) and it was academic and difficult but not bad. Do I want to go back and do it again? No, but I'm happy I finished it.<br /><br />At the end of the book Bate says his \"aim throughout this book has been to explore Shakespeare's wit in the full sixteenth-century sense of the word\" (407) which I suppose he did and although it would take someone smarter than me to realize that from the start. I didn't realize that was the goal or purpose of the book until I made it to page 407 and he told me. Bate provides lots of examples of Shakespeare's contemporaries praising him for his wit above all else and that at that time wit \"referred to the mind as the seat of consciousness and thought\" (406) so this complement is of the highest esteem. The one thing that I didn't feel like I ever got is a \"biography of the mind of William Shakespeare\" as promised in the sub-title of the book. The book never really felt like a biography and instead it was like a series of loosely connected essays looking at specific aspects of Shakespeare's plays and how they fit into the historical context of 16th century England.<br /><br />I'm having trouble thinking of more to say. I think I'm a little burned out from reading this and at this point I've said what I can. I wouldn't recommend this for the casual Shakespeare reader, and the more you already know about Latin, Elizabethan England, Senecan tragedy and the likes the better you'll be. If you're a big Shakespeare nerd as well as an academic nerd and you feel like challenging yourself, go for it. I know this was over my head at many points but I'm still glad I finished it and hopefully I learned something new that will come to me once my head stops spinning.<br /><br />If you're curious about my other posts about this book, you can find them here:<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/all-worlds-stage\">All the world's a stage</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/sonnet-is-crystallization-of-emotion-of\">A sonnet is the crystallization of the emotion of a momen</a>t<br /><br />Title quote from page 375, taken from Jacques' speech<br /><br />Bate, Jonathan.

I need to also learn that if I'm positive I'm facing the right direction I need to get up and switch seats, because I'm never right. Anyway, the book.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Bite+Me+cover.jpg\" />I just finished Christopher Moore's Bite Me: A Love Story, the third part of his vampire trilogy, consisting of  <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/it-was-as-if-vampirism-carried-with-it\">Bloodsucking Fiends</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/you-shouldnt-just-kill-guy-without\">You Suck</a>. The city of San Francisco is in danger again, this time from a giant vampire cat named Chet that is taking down the homeless and the hookers. We have the same cast of characters from the previous books trying to clean up the mess: Jody and Tommy (lover vampires); Abby Normal, Foo Dog and Jared (Goth high schooler and minion to J&amp;T, her \"manga-haired loved monkey\" and best friend); the Emperor and his brave men (a golden retriever and Boston terrier); the stoner Animals; and detectives Rivera and Cavuto. We also have a couple new characters: an elderly samurai print-maker, a set of ancient vampires come to clean up the mess Elijah (he who turned Jody and Chet) left; and their Renfield Kona, a white Hawaiian Rastafarian making an appearance after showing up in Moore's Fluke or I Know Why The Winged Whale Sings.<br /><br />Abby Normal is one of my favorite characters and Moore has her narrate that majority of Bite Me via her blog entries, which she totally has to keep up to date so she doesn't leave her fans (1 subscriber) waiting. I know I couldn't stand being in the same room as her if she were a real person, but as a character she is fantastic. I love reading how she describes a scene, a conversation, anything really. I know I included a few lines from her in my last Moore post, but she deserves another example:<br /><blockquote>And Flood's like, \"You don't have any confrontation issues, do you?\" And I'm all, \"No, I'm very insecure actually, but I have found that if you roll up screaming like a madwoman, hair on fire, guns blazing, no one is going to mention the zit on your forehead.\" Which is totally true. (224) </blockquote>I think, out of the three books, this is my least favorite. I love the characters and still found this to be a great and hilarious read, but the plot itself felt a bit weak and rushed. There are pretty much the same amount of characters as the previous installments, but since each group seemed to be doing their own thing so there was less time for each plot line. There's so much going on that you kind of get whip-lash following the story around. That said, this book does contain a few of my favorite scenes from the series that are so touching they remind me that Moore's tone doesn't always have to be this absurd, mad-cap humor.<br /><br />gThis part is kind of spoiler-y, so heads up<br />Jody was caught at outside at sun-up and unlike Meyer's creations, these vampires fry in sunlight. She was saved by Katusumi Okata, Samurai of Jackson Street, who had previously shown up to save the Emperor and his men from destruction from the demon kitties. He is an elderly artist, a print-maker that has lived in a basement apartment in Chinatown for years, though he never learned English or Cantonese. He pulls Jody into his dark apartment before the sun can reduce her to ash and feeds her his blood to help her heal. In all of the excitement and action that take place on the other pages, these scenes are an island of silence and calm. There's less humor here and more both kindness and sadness as Jody slowly heals and Okata quietly sketches her. Their scenes alone almost make up for some of the weaknesses elsewhere in the book.<br />Spoilers contained. You're safe now<br /><br />I know I've rambled a bit, but I do have one other thing to mention. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/morning-007\">I've said</a> on a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/literary-pet-peeves\">couple occasions</a> that I <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/top-bookish-pet-peeves\">hate eye-dialect</a>, which is when an author writes out phonetically how a character sounds. It's usually too difficult to understand so instead of being more fully immersed in the story by now hearing what the character should sound like, I'm completely taken out of the moment trying to figure out what the hell is being said. Moore manages to create a dialect I can understand. It's not nearly as impenetrable as what you can find in Shaw's Pygmalion which is probably why I can read what Kona is saying and understand him, at least as well as the other characters. Here's some of his speech: \"Oh, Jah's sweet love sistah, dat smoky biscuit givin' me da rippin' stiffy like dis fellah need to poke squid with that silver sistah on de Roll-Royce, don't you know?\" (203). From this I feel like I have an idea what a white Rastafarian with a bad Hawaiian accent might sound like and thus have a richer understand of the story. Or at least I can laugh at someone actually talking like that, especially when the other characters have such trouble understanding what the hell he's talking about.<br /><br />I didn't mean to read quite so much Moore at once, but I had to finish the trilogy. I can't say I'm disappointed or upset with this latest book, I just know Moore can do better. But I'd still recommend this one if you've read the rest of the series. It's an entertaining read and contains the absurdities you can come to expect in his writing.<br /><br />Context does help so if you're curious what he said, know that one of the vampires was \"stretched, naked, her arms wide like Winged Victory\" (202).<br /><br />Title quote from page 221<br /><br />Moore, Christopher.

I realize she's Chinese-American so it only kind of counts but I already have it so I'm going to re-read it for this little mini-challenge. I found a memoir called When I Was Puerto Rican by Esmeralda Santiago, which is about her growing up in rural Puerto Rico and then later moving to NYC. So both of the books are split between China/Puerto Rico and the US. At least there's a theme there. And Pete from <a href=\"http://petekarnas.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/tragic-isolation-in-chinese-literature/\">What You Read</a> recommended Ma Jian's Bejing Coma so that's another for me to be on the lookout for.<br /><br />So if anyone has any recommendations, please send them my way because I'm really at a loss.

I crack me up. Yesterday the Tuesday Top Ten topic was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/top-books-id-like-to-see-made-into\">books we'd like to see made into movies</a>. As I hopped around people's posts I was surprised to see how many people hate to see books up on the screen. I understand sometimes books don't translate well to the screen or that particular adaptation wasn't right. Sometimes the movie is a failure, regardless of if the source material came from a book or not. And of course when you read the book you get to make all of the choices a director is now making, so no movie will be your vision of a book. But personally, that doesn't bother me so much. I know a movie won't be quite what I envision and often I like the book better, but I still love to hear that my favorite books are going to be made into a movie. Maybe I'm just optimistic.<br /><br />Sure, there have been bad adaptations but to me anyway, some <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/page-to-screen-top-literary-adaptations\">successful movies come to mind</a>: The Lord of the Rings trilogy, High Fidelity, The Silence of the Lambs. Sure things were left out and altered and added. But you know what? That's OK. Sometimes things work in a book that won't work on the screen. Sometimes the pacing that works in a book isn't going to work on film. Plus Hollywood does not seem to have a problem rehashing a story over and over (and over) again so if one adaptation doesn't work, I'm never surprised to hear another one is somewhere on the horizon.<br /><br />So I just want to ask those that hate film adaptations of books if there's something specific you hate? I'm not knocking your opinion on it. I just want to understand. Are there general aspects of book films you don't like? Were you burned by an awful adaptation? Is all of the fans a book gets only after they've seen the movie? Please let me know! What is it about books on film that really grinds your gears?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:59+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:33:59+00:00","published_at":"2011-04-13T13:53:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e775dde22641900061c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"}]}]},{"id":"53224e775dde2238670002da","title":"Top Books I'd Like to See Made Into Movies","slug":"top-books-id-like-to-see-made-into-movies","url":"/articles/top-books-id-like-to-see-made-into-movies","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" />It's Tuesday again so again we have a Top Ten Tuesday, hosted by the ladies over a <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/04/jamies-top-ten-books-she-wants-to-see.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>. This week's question is what are the top 10 books I'd like to see made into movies. <br />1. A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Columbus_(filmmaker)\">Chris Columbus</a>, he of movies and not of misguided spice trade navigation, actually owns the movie rights to this so I have a small glimmer of hope that this will get made into a movie. A Beta Male becomes a death (not the Death) and tries to navigate his new condition while raising his daughter and running his second-hand shop which comes complete with characters like <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/you-shouldnt-just-kill-guy-without\">Abby Normal</a>.<br /><br />2. Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde - I don't think my favorite series, Thursday Next, will transfer well from page to screen. There are too many jokes and plot points that require you to be a reader and not a viewer. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/apart-we-are-together\">Shades of Grey</a> however, would be fantastic to see since the whole society is based on the fact that people can only see a single color and other than that everything is just various shades of grey. I'd love to see the world through Eddie Russett's eyes.<br /><br /><br />3. Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card - Another one that's been in the talks to get made into a movie, so another small possibility of actually seeing this on the big screen. I'd love to see how the Battle School is rendered but I still think they need to age Ender and the other kids up or else I'll never be able to take the movie seriously.<br /><br /><br />4. Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clark - Look how much people like British wizards in the Harry Potter world. Now it's historical fiction mixed with fantasy. They would need to cut the story down to get it to fit, or else split it over two movies, but I'd see it. I imagine there would be some beautiful settings.<br /><br /><br />5. World War Z by Max Brooks - Well look at this, another one that's in the talks to get made into a movie. Now I understand there is a vast difference between rumors of a movie and something actually getting made but I'm getting my hopes up for this one. I'm not exactly sure how they'll weave a narrative out of the collection of \"survivors stories\" but I'm looking forward to it. Even if it means lot of zombie nightmares.<br /><br /><br />6. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth Grahme-Smith - Oh hey, more zombies! And it's another one that is supposedly in the talks of being made. There are plenty of versions of P&amp;P but I think the world can accept one where Lizzie and Darcy are both champion zombie killers.<br /><br /><br />7. Fool by Christopher Moore - I'd love to see this as a movie. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/were-all-fates-bastards\">King Lear, told from the Fool's point of view</a>, with a typical Moore twist. It's a hilarious, sometimes dark retelling of Shakespeare's play and has the Fool as the driving force behind everything that happens, along with a back-story and name, Pocket, for the courtly jester.<br /><br />I was really thinking I could make it to 10 this week but alas, it appears not to be.

But I was wandering around a lovely independent bookstore and found a copy a The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way on sale for $5. Couldn't pass that up! I've actually read this before but to be honest, I don't remember it. I had bought a copy of this at some point back in college. And also at some point in college I lent the book out to someone and never saw it again. I'm not sure who has it, but I hope they're enjoying.<br /><br />Bryson's skill is taking a dry topic and making it interesting. How else does a book that goes over phonetic topics such as aphesis, apocope, syncope (which by the way, spell check does not recognize) make for something I want to pick up and pick up multiple times at that? I think there are two things Bryson does that make the everyday exciting: he approaches each topic with enthusiasm and from an amateur's standpoint. It would be easy for a book like this to veer off into the very technical aspects of the history and phonetics of the language and end up requiring the reader to be an expert. You never get the feeling you need to be taking notes, because you're going to be tested when reading Bryson. Even the terminology above is given to sate any curiosity about the technical terms he's describing, but could easily be left out without leading to confusion about the topic at hand. By the way, those terms refer to the dropping of sounds during normal speech, for example looked being phonetically pronounced \"lookt\", Australia being shortened to \"Stralia\" and the street in London Marleybone becoming \"Mairbun\" or even \"Mbn\". \"For the record, when bits are nicked off the front end of words it's called aphesis, when off the back it's called apocope and when it's from the middle it's syncope\". (88) For a further (and more amusing) example of this, Bryson uses his humor (the best teacher) to give further example:<br /><blockquote>\"Where the British will say howjado for 'how do you do,' an American will say jeetjet for 'have you taken sustenance recently?' and lesskweet for 'in that case, let us retire to a convivial place for a spot of refreshment.'\" (89)</blockquote>The book discusses the history of English from the time our (very distant) ancestors began making guttural noises, through the Saxon and Roman occupation in England, the dynamic development during Shakespeare's day, the influx of various languages into English during the mass immigration to America in the early 20th century, and through to present day, or at least 1990 when the book was written. \"Swearing\" might be my favorite chapter, because I have the sense of humor of a 13 year old boy. The first line of the chapter is \"Among the Chinese, to be called a turtle is the worst possible taunt,\" (214). I told Boyfriend he was a turtle, but he just looked at my confused. Apparently he is too far separated from his roots to appreciate such an insult. It is interesting to see what words have always been curses, what words have developed their taboo and which have lost it. Fuck has always been pretty bad, cunt was once \"relatively harmless\" and used by Chaucer (and spelled queynte and queinte, as well as the typical spelling, which I find fantastic) and in \"nineteenth-century England puppy and cad were highly risqu\u00e9\" (217).<br /><br />If you want to know more about the history, quirks and direction of the English language, you could do a lot worse than this one. It's funny and you don't need a linguistics degree to understand it. I'm pretty sure I've said it before, but I would read a book about paint drying if Bryson wrote it.<br /><br />Title quote from page 11<br /><br />Bryson, Bill.

In an effort to put in my two cents worth, or like 5 dollars worth since I guess my 2 cents are over in his comments (I don't understand money), I thought I'd continue the conversation here.g<br /><br />Do you feel obligated to review every book you read? Are there any types of books (crappy, obscure, boring) that you won't review?<br /><br />Personally, I don't feel any obligation to write about any particular book or in any particular format. I started this blog as a means to get back into writing, since I'd mostly let that skill atrophy since college, and I picked book blogging because that was the topic I was most interested in and I figured I read enough I wouldn't run out of topics. I'm not being paid for any reviews so I certainly don't feel any responsibility to review everything I read. All the books are ones I'm reading for my own enjoyment.<br /><br />Having said this, I do write about all of the books I read. I'm spending my time to read it so I figure I may as well write something, be it that I like the book, don't like the book or the book makes me think of some more interesting topic. Not having something to say has never stopped me from prattling on before, and I'm not letting it stop me now. But this is a personal choice and I admire the bloggers that are able to resist posting when they have nothing to say, even if that means skipping a review.<br /><br />Going beyond what you do with your own reviews, what do you like to see from book blogs you follow? Do you want bloggers to review everything? Do you want them to only review the books they liked? Do you want them to avoid reviewing obscure titles?<br /><br />This is a nicer way of saying \"I'm stealing the topic Greg already wrote about over at his blog, and if you want the original you could just go over there and see what he says.\"","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:01+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:01+00:00","published_at":"2011-04-07T13:03:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e795dde22fdcf000544","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"},{"value":"book review","slug":"book-review","url":"/articles/tags/book-review"}]}]},{"id":"53224e795dde2223b6000160","title":"You can never hide as long as there is parsley nearby","slug":"you-can-never-hide-as-long-as-there-is-parsley-nearby","url":"/articles/you-can-never-hide-as-long-as-there-is-parsley-nearby","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Farming+of+Bones+cover.jpg\" />In an effort to read a more diverse selection of literature, I've picked up The Farming of Bones by Haitian author Edwidge Danticat . I bought the book for a class sometime back in college, judging by the \"used\" stickers on it, yet I believe it was one of the books we never got to. I'm glad I did buy this, even if we never got around to it in class, because it's definitely a book I wouldn't have otherwise picked up. Not without some very strong recommendations from trusted sources anyway.<br /><br />The book deals with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley_Massacre\">Parsley Massacre</a>, the months leading up to the killings and the years after as the survivors try to come to terms with the grief they've experienced and the people they've lost. The Generallissimo Rafael Trujillo ordered the deaths of some 30,000 Haitians living in the Dominican Republic. In order to determine who was Haitian, Trujillo's soldiers would ask people to pronounce the Spanish word for parsley, perejil, knowing that Haitians \"did not trill their r...or pronounce the jota\" (304).<br /><br />The story is narrated by Amabelle, a young Haitian girl who was orphaned when a raging river took her parents. Amabelle was rescued by a wealthy Dominican family and raised with Papi's daughter, eventually becoming a house servant in the Dominican Republic. During the day she is happy with her life, caring for Senora Valencia and hoping to one day marry Sebastian, a fellow Haitian who works on a sugar cane plantation. At night she's haunted by the deaths of her parents as her dreams keep taking her back to the day they died. One day Senora gives birth with Amabelle acting as midwife. As Senora's husband Pico, an officer for Trujillo, rushes home to greet his newborn children, he runs over a Haitian. Anxious to get home to his family, he refuses his father-in-laws pleas to stay and see who was hurt and if there's anything they can do. It turns out the man he hit was Sebastian's friend Joel. Sebastian and Yves were able to jump out of the car's way in time, but Joel wasn't so lucky. Pico mimics the general sentiments of the Dominican population, that a Haitian life isn't worth a second thought. Eventually the El Corte killings reach Amabelle's town and the people must flee if they hope to survive.<br /><br />I tend to stay away from summaries in my reviews because I'd rather discuss pieces of the book and leave a summary for any of the other million places you can get one. However, I'm having trouble coming up with something to say. This book is certainly not light and I can't put my finger on any particular problem, but I wasn't moved by the story as I thought I would be. I like the characters, I think they're well-rounded and well-described. But I never got a chance to connect with them. Perhaps the problem is the story feels rushed. It's not a long book, only 310 pages, yet it seems to cover so much. Just as I'm getting used to normal life in Alegria, the cuttings start. Various characters say there are rumors of soldiers killing Haitians with machetes but the story never makes it feel like this is a real rumor touching on the characters. I needed to be shown, not told that these rumors were floating around. I never feel the suspicion, the worry that many of the characters say they're experiencing. Likewise, it feels like the journey to Haiti ends so abruptly. The only time I feel like the characters get a chance to tell their story is as the years go by and the survivors deal with their grief.<br /><br />That said, Danticat has some beautiful prose that almost makes up for the quickness of the story. As a matter of fact, I was so taken by her writing that I didn't really notice how quickly we'd moved on and how much more I wanted to read until the moment had passed. There's a part where Amabelle, during a fever dream, sees her mother<br /><blockquote>\"I was saving my smile for when you needed it,\" she says, in a cheerful voice I do not remember, for she had always spoken so briefly and so sternly. \"I didn't want you to think that love was not scarce because it is, that it flowed freely from everywhere, or that it was something you could expect without price from everyone\"...\"You were like my shadow. Always fled when I came to you and only followed when I left you alone. You will be well again, ma bell, Amabelle. I know this to be true. And how can you have ever doubted my love? You, my eternity.\" (208)</blockquote>I haven't found a new favorite book or a new favorite author, though I'm not opposed to trying out something else Danticat has written, I'm glad to expand my reading circle beyond the sarcastic dark humor that is my usual go-to. And of course reading something out of the white, European-American, male literary canon is nice as well. If only this was written sometime before the 1970s I would have fulfilled all of my goals from my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/march-reading-wrap-up\">March reading wrap-up</a>. Don't worry, this doesn't mean I think I'm done reading non-white, non-American authors (just as it doesn't mean I'm never going back to those guys), it just means I'm moving in the right direction.<br /><br />Title quote from page 304<br /><br />Danticat, Edwidge.

The question for this hop is: Do you find yourself predisposed to like (or dislike) books that are generally accepted as great books and have been incorporated into the literary canon? Discuss the affect you believe a book's status has on your opinion of it.<br /><br />I want to start off apologizing in advance in case this post turns out to be rambling and incoherent. I got home late last which means I didn't get much sleep and lack of sleep tends to make be babble. I'd like to say the lack of sleep is cos I was out celebrating my birthday, which is part of it. Those of you who follow me on Twitter also know that some jackass coming back from the Knicks game puked all over the car I was in on the LIRR, which meant we got to hang around Queens for some time while that got cleaned up. (See what you're missing if you don't follow me on Twitter! It's all gold like that.) Really, learn to hold your liquor or stay off public transportation.<br /><br />Anyway, the question! I do find myself forming a tentative opinion of a book before reading it and sadly it's usually negative. Or at least wary. I'm not exactly sure why I do this. I've read plenty of \"classics,\" both ones that I thought were wonderful as well as ones that made me wish I was reading a phone book instead of this piece of \"great literature\". I'm not sure why I almost always go into \"classic\" books assuming it's going to be a painful experience but I know it's certainly the case. Take for example Pride and Prejudice. I just recently read the original book. I've read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies a couple times and you better like P&amp;P if you're going to give the zombie version a shot. And yet, when I finally got around to reading P&amp;P (which took some convincing) I still thought I wasn't going to like it. I don't know why, other than I'm very stubborn. I'm currently doing it with Jane Eyre. So many people say it's their favorite book. My favorite series begins with the book The Eyre Affair. I have a copy of the book and yet I'm really struggling to get myself to just start it.<br /><br />I try to repeat to myself that a good story is a good story and not to be intimidated by the status of the book. I'm not going to say I've loved or even liked every classic I've read, but it's even enough that I really need to get over this knee-jerk reaction.<br /><br />What about you? How does a book's \"status\" affect your opinion of it?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:02+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:02+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-31T14:02:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7a5dde22641900061e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7a5dde2238670002dc","title":"Apart We Are Together","slug":"apart-we-are-together","url":"/articles/apart-we-are-together","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Shades+of+Grey+cover.jpg\" />I've just recently finished up Jasper Fforde's Shades of Grey. Fforde is one of my favorite writers, but he's a difficult author to describe to those unfamiliar with him. His books can fall into so many categories and so many genres, it's hard to say who would enjoy him. I've told people his work is \"absurdist literary humor\". A fellow Fforde enthusiast, <a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/review-one-of-our-thursdays-is-missing-by-jasper-fforde/\">The Book Stop</a>, recently reviewed the latest book from the Thursday Next series and begins her post trying to describe Fforde's writing. Because she said it better than I did, I want to quote her directly:<br /><blockquote>No one writes like Jasper Fforde. He's been compared to Douglas Adams but even that's kind of a stretch. His books are kind of the adult version of The Phantom Tollbooth, with adventure and time travel thrown in. Bottom line: if your tastes range from fantasy to science fiction to classic literature humor, these are the books for you.</blockquote> She was directly referring to the Thursday Next series, but this fits for his other books as well.<br /><br />Like the Thursday Next and Nursery Crime series, Shades of Grey takes place in its own world but is the first of his works that is a dystopian novel. The new world is called Chromatacia and social hierarchy is completely determined by how much and what color you can see. The world is dominated by \"the Rules\", which dictate every part of life, from the micro (\"2.3.09.23.061: Slouching is not permitted under any circumstances\" [location 5249]) to the macro (\"3.9.34.59.667: In order to maintain the quality of breeding stock and to maintain public decency, complementary colors are absolutely forbidden to marry.\" [location 522]) and a series of \"Leapbacks\" means inventions as simple as the light bulb are not available, even though people can't see anything after twilight. It's not entirely clear when this is taking place. It's sometime far in the future of our own world, but information about \"the Previous\" is withheld, so it's never clear exactly when this is or what happened to destroy our current civilization and create this new selectively hued humanity.<br /><br />This took me longer to get into than the other Fforde books simply because becoming familiar with this completely new world is difficult when you have to search for clues as to what's going on. Believe me, I prefer this to a narration dump, but it does mean it's a little harder to find your narrative footing. Once I have an idea of the world and our main character Eddie Russett makes it to East Carmine, the story really takes off. It has what you expect from a dystopian novel: oppressive government, an unbending society that does not deviate from the rules, and people trying to subvert the stasis to make the world a good, fair place. As much as the word of Munsell wants to simplify the world into a series of black and white rules, the world is full of shades of grey (see what Fforde did there? pretty clever) for people who want to acknowledge them.<br /><br />Despite the dystopian setting, this is by Fforde and is in no way as dark as a 1984, Brave New World or The Handmaid's Tale. It is a smart, funny, absurd story that deals with heavy topics in a light way. Here are a couple quotes to demonstrate Fforde's sense of humor that is imbibed throughout the book<br /><blockquote>\"Constance had refused me a tango on the grounds that it was a 'gateway dance' to something bolder, such as a lambada\" (location 2376)</blockquote><blockquote>\"She laughed. The sound was lovely - yet quite out of character. It would be like hearing a fish sneeze.\" (location 3957)</blockquote><blockquote>\"First, time spent on reconnaissance is never wasted. Second, almost anything can be improved with the addition of bacon. And finally, there is no problem on earth that can't be ameliorated by a hot bath and a cup of tea.\" (location 4261)</blockquote>I'm excited to see that this is the first in another Fforde series. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as Thursday Next, but still, I can't wait to read the next books in the series when they come out. It deals with heavier themes and thus doesn't have the same lightness and easiness that comes with TN or NC. It's sadder and darker and wonderful.<br /><br />Title quote is repeated throughout the book as the motto for the Colourtocracy.<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper. Shades of Grey 1: The Road to High Saffron.

They say a lady never shares her age, but I looked up the definition of lady and I think I qualify for the label anatomically only, so I may as well tell you I'm 27. I also share because I look about 17, judging from all of the times and places I get carded. It's also my Grandma's birthday but as she is a lady I'll keep her age a secret.<br /><br />To keep this post book related I wanted to share 2 things. 1 is a piece written by Dan O'Brien over at Cracked.com. Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/03/segments-sunday-paper-edition.html\">Dead End Follies</a> posted a link to it on his site as well, but I want to make sure everyone sees it. It's called <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-things-they-never-told-us/\">5 Things They Never Told Us</a> and it's really about all of the things you're never told while growing up about being an adult. Especially the \"you don't become an adult, you just suddenly are one\". Regardless of what it says, I'm still kind of waiting for some big moment where I go, \"right, now I'm an adult.\"<br /><br />The second thing is stolen from llevinso from <a href=\"http://femalebookreader.blogspot.com/2011/03/happy-birthday-to-me.html\">Sarcastic Female Literary Circle</a>, who also recently had a birthday. Here are some famous people who share my birthday with me. (Yes, it's my birthday that they're sharing with me.

I know I won't come close to listing out 10 authors. And the authors I'll list are ones I've talked about and talked about almost ad nauseum. I don't want to include authors if I'm not familiar with a few of their books. A single book isn't enough for me to recommend an author. A book yes, but the author, no.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do love these authors and want more people to check them out. And I figure I'll be hopping around to see what other authors are out there people want to spread the word on, so I may as well take part. If you are a regular reader, you already know who I'll say so feel free to skip over this.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde - I have a post about his book Shades of Grey planned for tomorrow, so you'll see some fawning then. Fforde writes absurd, literary humor that doesn't easily fall into any genre without sticking a toe into several other pools. He has 3 series: Thursday Next, Nursery Crime and Shades of Grey. Thursday Next is about a Literatec agent who spends time policing literature in both the real world and the book world. My favorite series which has my favorite book (The Well of Lost Plots) and stars my favorite character (Thursday Next). Nursery Crime is a spin off of TN, and is a hardboiled detective working in a Nursery Rhyme world. And then there's the latest series Shades of Grey, which I'll go into in tomorrow's post.<br /><br />Christopher Moore - He seems to have a fairly substantial following so he might be on the fence as to an author that needs more recognition but I figure I'll include him anyway since I've yet to read a book of his and not enjoy it. Another author with an absurd sense of humor though without the literary aspect of Fforde. Don't think that means the stories aren't smart, it just means there are less allusions to classic literature and scenes with jerking off.<br /><br />Octavia E. Butler - I've only read one series of hers, Xenogenesis/Lilith's Brood,  but it was 3 books so I'm counting it for these purposes. She was an African-American female (obviously) science fiction author. A minority within a minority and she turned out some fantastic, literary science fiction. Writing literary science fiction pretty much adds another level to that minority status.  She should not be over-looked.<br /><br />Alright so that's really all I've got. There are other books I've enjoyed, but I can't recommend an author based on a single book. Then there are the other authors I love, but I'm pretty sure Stephen King and even Bill Bryson don't need that much extra push from me.<br /><br />So what are some authors you think need to get more recognition?<br /><br />If you're curious to see some posts I've written about the above authors, check out the links below!<br />Jasper Fforde<br />The Eyre Affair<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/they-kep-eye-onovertly-free-thespian\">They keep an eye on...overtly thespian interpretations.</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/we-try-to-make-art-perfect-because-we\">We try to make art perfect because we never manage it in real life.</a><br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">You're Upsetting The Wo'rms!

I was doing pretty well in the beginning, and then as I went down the list I had read fewer and fewer and nothing at all after Hitchhiker. I wonder how the order was decided. The students had to select 100 books out of a list of 400 for the list, and then a group of instructors put those lists together, so perhaps the books at the top were the ones that showed up the most times on each list. In that case, it makes sense that I'd read more of the ones at the top of the list. Those are the, in general, most popular books. I have no idea if that's actually how the order was decided but makes sense to me.<br />So how's your list look?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:03+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:03+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-25T13:27:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7b5dde2238670002df","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"I love lists","slug":"i-love-lists","url":"/articles/tags/i-love-lists"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7c5dde2223b6000166","title":"Do you give up on books?","slug":"do-you-give-up-on-books","url":"/articles/do-you-give-up-on-books","body":"<img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/abandoned+book.jpg\" />Remember how <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/all-worlds-stage\">I said I was having trouble getting through Bate's Soul of the Age</a> so my solution was to read an age, read a different book, come back for another age, repeat until I finished? And I even said in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/sonnet-is-crystallization-of-emotion-of\">my last post about the book</a> how things were looking up and getting more interesting? At least I'm consistent in my failing to keep up with promises to myself, because I've already failed. This is why I stay away from challenges.<br /><br />I finished up the Lover age, read <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/goog_1944708933\">Christopher Moore's </a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/you-shouldnt-just-kill-guy-without\">You Suck</a>, and then I was all prepared to pick up Soul of the Age again. (This is going to seem like I'm just rambling, but I promise you, it does come back to books.)  Since I now work from home and live in the suburbs without a car, I spend a lot of my time hanging around the apartment and Saturday was so beautiful, I decided I needed to get out. Boyfriend had to work and they didn't have anyone to take pictures of the game, so I volunteered my services to be the photographer for the women's lacrosse game. I do this sometimes if they don't have someone else, and they let me because I work for free and have my own equipment. It's actually probably good they don't rely on me, since when we got to the university I realized the memory card was in my other camera. I could have gone back and gotten it, but they were fine without pictures, and I'm lazy. Instead I hung around campus for awhile and just watched the game. And by watched the game I mean I randomly looked up from my book to see why there was cheering.<br /><br />This is the point I wanted to get to: I brought You Suck and my Kindle with me. Had I actually remembered my memory card, I would have had a lot less reading time, and therefore wouldn't have finished You Suck and wouldn't have needed another book. But that's not how things went, and I finished You Suck and needed something else. So I bought an ecopy and started reading Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde, which I've wanted for awhile but was originally waiting for it to come out in paperback. Thank you Kindle, for allowing me to purchase things I'm too impatient to wait for.<br /><br />I do plan on making it back to Soul of the Age but it seems like it's going to take longer and longer to complete that one. So I have a couple questions:<br />Do you ever stop a book in the middle? What makes you stop?<br />Do you have any books you stuck with and in the end you were happy you kept with it?<br />Do you have a book you finished despite your better judgement and regretted it?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:04+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:04+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-23T15:34:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7c5dde2223b6000167","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Jasper Fforde","slug":"jasper-fforde","url":"/articles/tags/jasper-fforde"},{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"},{"value":"Shades of Grey","slug":"shades-of-grey","url":"/articles/tags/shades-of-grey"},{"value":"Soul of the Age","slug":"soul-of-the-age","url":"/articles/tags/soul-of-the-age"},{"value":"quitting a book","slug":"quitting-a-book","url":"/articles/tags/quitting-a-book"},{"value":"Jonathan Bate","slug":"jonathan-bate","url":"/articles/tags/jonathan-bate"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7c5dde22fdcf000547","title":"Top Bookish Pet Peeves","slug":"top-bookish-pet-peeves","url":"/articles/top-bookish-pet-peeves","body":"<img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" /><br />This Tuesday's Top Ten hop, hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-ten-bookish-pet-peeves-with-ginger.html\">The Broke and the Bookish,</a> asks what are your top literary pet peeves? Anything from things that bug you in a story to things bookstores do to the physical book itself, what bothers you?  Here goes:<br /><br />In the story<br />Eye dialect - The Blue Bookcase, in their own book hop, asked a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/literary-pet-peeves\">question about literary pet peeves</a> and this is the number one thing that drives me nuts in an actual story. Eye dialect is when an author writes a character's dialog phonetically so you get the feeling of what the person actually sounds like. If it's done well, it can add depth and realism to a story. However, usually it's annoying and the only way to understand what's being said is to actually read those parts aloud. And personally, that makes me sound stupid and/or really racist.<br /><br />Stream of consciousness - I always like the idea of stream-of-conscious writing, but I've yet to enjoy it in execution. I'm looking at you, Joyce.<br /><br />At the bookstore<br />Hidden books - I love those tables with new releases or recommended books or whathaveyou. They usually have some good books I probably wouldn't have found if they were just in the stacks. However, if I'm actually looking for a specific book, I usually can't find it with the author's other works and I have to go hunt down all of those tables to see if it's hiding there.<br /><br />Trying to find non-fiction books in a big box store - OK, this might just be the fact that I never know how these things are organized, but I can never find books like Freakonomics at the store. Fiction is simple but non-fiction usually means a book could be in any one of several places. At this point I'll go check one of those computers that are normally around the big box stores and while those are helpful in telling me if the book is hidden somewhere in the store, but it doesn't tell me where.<br /><br />On the books<br />Man-handled cover - I hate to see someone bend the cover of a book back. I don't personally write in books but it doesn't pain me to see someone else taking notes. But this makes me die a little.<br /><br />Stickers on the cover - This just goes along with not liking to see the cover hurt, but I hate when stickers are on the cover cos I have a need to yank it off. And that many times takes a part of the cover with it.<br /><br />Apparently I'm less annoyed by things than I thought I would be.  Or I'm just having a mental block right now.<br /><br />What are your bookish pet peeves?<br /><br />Update As I've been checking out other people's posts I've seen some other bookish things that drive me nuts. I'm going to stay away from some story features because for the most part it's a matter of the author being a bad author and I don't want to blame the tricks or techniques if the problem lays in an untalented writer. Eye dialect and stream-of-consciousness annoy me regardless of if they're \"done well\" or I've never seen an example of it working.<br /><br />Series that don't announce they're a series - I obviously just mentioned I read You Suck before realizing it was the second in the series. It'd be nice if there was something to indicate I was about to start in the middle of the story. The Thursday Next series does this too. I didn't realize it was a series and was just lucky enough that I picked up the next book in the series instead of jumping around.<br /><br />Messy bookshelves - This goes along with that OCD I mention around bending book covers. The shelves don't have to be organized in anyway other than however you like it, but essentially, if it looks like the books are about to be damaged I'm going to freak out in my head. And if I know you well, out loud, while I fix things. While on the topic of messy bookshelves<br /><br /><img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/HP+Collection.jpg\" />Mismatched series - I really don't care if your sets don't match, but I have conniptions if mine don't. See my Harry Potter \"set\" over there. I picked up the second book at an English language bookstore in Rome and really didn't care about the cover. Then I slowly collected the other books and was sad the set didn't match. I actually went out of my way to buy the 6th book in a format that looked similar to the 2nd book. It's an \"adult cover\" copy of the book and I was just happy I didn't end up with some weird HP slashfiction.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:04+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:04+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-22T12:57:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7c5dde22fdcf000548","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7d5dde2238670002e0","title":"You shouldn't just kill a guy without asking.

I'm pretty sure I've said this 100 times so apologies for the repetition but I've read this one before. However, I didn't know who Christopher Moore was at the time or that this was the second in a series. I was drawn to the title and the description on the back cover, as well as the fact that it was in the clearance section of a bookstore and I was on vacation and out of books. I wasn't hindered by the fact that I hadn't read the first part of the story, but it was much funnier this second time around.<br /><br />gYou Suck picks up right where Bloodsucking Fiends left off, so if you haven't read that and are particularly worried about BF spoilers, you should probably just skip down to the quotes at the bottom of the post. Now that I think about it, there will probably be some spoilers about You Suck as well, so you're probably safest just ignoring this whole part. Why did I bother writing it then? Excellent question. Well, off we go then<br /><br /><br />I was going to write the typical review of the book, but I thought that wouldn't be all that fun. I will, as way of intro, tell you I enjoyed this book even more than BF. It was published over 10 years later, and right between 2 other Moore books I love (A Dirty Job and Fool) and it feels like one of those latter works. The story is more focused on the characters and their development and less on the evil-vampire plot, which the first book focused on. The characters are really Moore's forte so instead of going on anymore about how much I enjoyed this, I figured I'd give you a description of the characters and let you decide if you think these guys would populate a book you would enjoy.<br /><br />First, our returning cast<br />Jody - Our red-headed fledging vampire from the first book. She's learning to love her new sense of power, especially now that she can walk the streets at night without the fear she had grown so used to. Not only does she have someone to share the sound of shapes with, but she also has someone who figured out a way for her to get her (blood-laced) coffee.<br />C. Thomas Flood - The aspiring writer who has a lot more time to write now that Jody turned him into a fellow bloodsucker, with the body and mind of a nineteen year old. It's taking him some time to get used to his new condition, but he did find them a new minion using his knowledge of Byron, so that's something.<br />Elijah Ben Sapir - The vampire who originally turned Jody is encased in bronze as we last left him in BF and is making a killing both as the statue performance artist and of course, in the literal sense. Going from owning a million-plus dollar yacht to killing people for their track suits will make some people a bit annoyed.<br />The Animals - Tommy's old crew at the grocery store who helped catch Elijah in the first place. Stoners, slackers and in general good guys, though they don't have the best financial sense.<br />The Emperor and his men, Lazarus and Bummer - My favorite characters from the last book are back and helping to capture the vampires slowly taking over the Emperor's city of San Francisco. Unfortunately, these guys are not in the story nearly as much as BF but otherwise they're fun.<br />Rivera and Cavuto - The two detectives from the previous story are back to solve more suspicious murders happening around town as they watch their dreams of owning a rare bookstore and golf fly out the window. Why couldn't the vampires have just left the city?<br />Steve - A minor character in the first book, he shows up with more oomph this time. He's a biotech student that not only figures out a possible to solution to Tommy and Jody's condition, but also deduces a way to bring down the vampires, sun or no sun.<br /><br />And our new editions<br />Blue - She's an escort the Animals picked up while in Vegas, spending the money that they got selling Elijah's extensive art collection. Why's she called Blue, you're asking? To distinguish herself from other hookers, she dyed her skin blue. Why'd the guys pick her up and give her the better part of $600k? Well, they decided they all wanted to bone a Smurf. She sees herself more as Snow White and now she just needs her seven dwarfs.<br />Abby Normal - Now that Tommy can no longer be Jody's bitch and do her daytime bidding (that whole bursting into flames when in sunlight is causing some trouble), the vampires have picked up a new minion. A goth teenager with regrettable moments of perkiness, her PoV make up chapters here and there. She would annoy the hell out of me in real life, but her chapters are hilarious.<br /><br />I kept that pretty You Suck spoiler free, so if you want to go back and read it, you're safe. Why didn't I just go back and amend what I wrote above? Another excellent question! Now onto some quotes to keep giving you the flavor of the book. I will keep these spoiler free!<br /><br />\"I was going to be an awesome hunk of muscular man-meat.\"<br />\"No, you weren't. You wanted to be a writer. You were going to have little stick arms and get winded when you hit the back-space key more than three times consecutively.\" (8)<br /><br />\"It turned out that superhuman strength came in handy when shaving a thirty-five pound cat.\" (29)<br /><br />from the Abby Chonicles<br />\"Even as I sit here at the Metreon Starbucks, writing this, the froth slaves seem to move like silver-eyed zombies and my nonfat, soy Amaretto Mochaccino has gone as bitter as snake bile. (Which is like the most bitterest bile you can get.)\" (164)<br /><br />\"I am like the poor cabron in that book The Pearl, where by simply trying to take advantage of some good fortune, I have lost all that I care about. Okay, I did get drunk for a week and my pearl was a blue whore who fucked the chimichangas out of me, but still, pretty sad. He thought these things in Spanish, so they sounded infinitely more tragic and romantic.\" (208-209)<br /><br />\"unless Ninjas are also Japanese, in which case I will have to look some shit up for metaphors because the only thing Chinese I can think of right now is Dim Sum, and I believe it's disrespectful to refer to your soul mate in terms of finger food\" (276)<br /><br />I've already gone ahead and picked up the third book, Bite Me: A Love Story so this won't be the end of Moore's vampire tales.<br /><br />Title quote from page 2<br /><br />Moore, Christopher.

I said in my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/all-worlds-stage\">other post </a>about this book that I was going to read an age in this book, read  a different, interesting book, come back to tackle another Shakespearean ageg, etc. I hate stopping a book in the middle and besides, this was a gift from Boyfriend, so I'm going to be able to say I tried. I spared you a post after reading the Schoolboy, which is, I'm sure, super interesting if you're familiar with Latin.  Especially Latin puns.<br /><br />The Lover has started off on a stronger foot than Infant and Schoolboy.  It begins with a story about Elizabethan condoms as invented by Gabrielle Falloppio, he of the fallopian tubes. Really, it's this line that got me: \"Known colloquially as an overcoat, the device was eight inches long and tied at the base with a pink ribbon to make it more acceptable to women\" (149).  Oh Fallopius, always thinking of the ladies.  This section is helped along by the fact that I'm extraordinarily immature.  And thus to we segue into Shakespeare's home life, marriage and 3 kids before the age of 21, and his depiction of love and lust in his plays and sonnets.<br /><br />Perhaps because the topic itself is more based in human emotion than a recitation of the Latin and Greek history Shakespeare would have received, I've been more drawn into this age. Or perhaps the references are clearer to me. The entire book thus far seems to require the reader to already be familiar with not only Shakespeare's life and works but also others plays, poems and general life of this time. I am not well-versed enough to follow some of the references and allusions used in the first to ages but apparently I've taken enough Shakespeare and 16th Century Lit classes that the Lover made sense to me.<br /><br />Bate blends Shakespeare's history, general history of the time and Shakespeare's work to put together a biography. He's not looking at Shakespeare's work as autobiographical, but simply to find parallels between the Elizabethan age and the plays and sonnets.<br /><br />The Lover is split up into three parts: we start, as I mentioned before, discussing what is known about Shakespeare's own married life. Bate looks at statistics from the time to see the average age of a first marriage, the stigma, or indeed lack of, surrounding pregnant brides and the actual court records and marriage license of a William Shaxpere and Anna Whateley.<br /><br />Next up comes the Bawdy Courts which were essentially the Real Housewives of Elizabethan England. A woman's reputation was the most valuable thing she had and these courts gave her the chance to defend herself when called things like \"maggoty whore,\" \"tinker's trull,\" \"common as a barber's chair\" (168) and other names that are even more fun. Bate connects the Bawdy Courts with the court scenes in his plays.<br /><br />Lastly there is The Perplexities of Love, which examines the sonnets, their historical Petrarchan position and use in the royal courts. This section contains a lot less name calling and syphilis remedies but I liked this section the best. It looks at how other poets of the time used sonnets, especially the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blason\">blason</a>, and how Shakespeare turned the traditions on their head (\"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\" Sonnet 130).<br /><br />I'm still going to take a break and move onto a different book after each age. I liked this one but I've been hurt by the previous two. But I'll keep coming back to this until it's finished. I'm not sure it that's tenacity or just plain stubbornness.<br /><br />The book is divided up in the ages from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world's_a_stage\">Jacques' \"All the world's a stage\" speech</a> from As You Like It. In case you're unfamiliar, it is Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Solider, Justice, Pantaloon, Oblivion.<br /><br />Title quote from page 187<br /><br />Bate, Jonathan.

My original plans for the holiday involved seeing Dropkick Murphys, as is my usual, but now that I'm no longer in Boston plans have changed. I totally would have made it on stage this year too. A friend of mine is currently in Ireland, which I'm very jealous of. The festivities are actually bigger Stateside, but I just haven't been to Ireland in a long time and would love to go back. I may not be Irish myself, but my red hair lets me blend in.<br /><br />Anyway, I was trying to come up with a topic for today. Should I do what I did for International Women's Day and include links to my posts about Irish authors?  Well, I just did that AND I currently have only <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/if-room-wasnt-our-home-does-that-mean\">one post</a> for that list, which is a little pathetic. A lot pathetic. I could skip over St. Paddy's Day and answer the <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2011/03/literary-blog-hop-march-17-20.html\">Literary Blog Hop question</a>, but I can't think of a good answer. Certainly not an honest one. I could tell you about the <a href=\"http://www.writersmuseum.com/museum.asp\">Dublin Writers Museum</a> except whenever I've been in Dublin I've failed to convince people to go with me, so I can't actually tell you what it's like. I have been to the Guinness Storehouse a couple times, but that's not exactly book related. So what to do?<br /><br />I realized there are a couple other book bloggers out there who have actually done something for the holiday, so rather than come up with something half-assed (more half-assed than what I've already done) I'll send you their way!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://rereadinglives.blogspot.com/2011/02/irish-short-story-reading-life-event.html\">The Reading Life</a> is hosting an Irish Short Story week, which <a href=\"http://lifetimereadingplan.blogspot.com/2011/03/irish-short-story-week.html\">Lifetime Reading Plan</a> and <a href=\"http://shortstoryslore.blogspot.com/2011/03/irish-short-story-week-oscar-wildes.html\">Short Story Slore</a> are taking part in.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://sarahreadstoomuch.blogspot.com/2011/03/lucky-leprechaun-giveaway.html\">Sara Reads Too Much</a> and Short Story Slore (very in the spirit!) are both taking part in a Lucky Leprechaun giveaway.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://yvettecandraw.blogspot.com/2011/03/wednesday-quotes-of-day.html\">In so many words...</a> has a list of some fantastic Oscar Wilde quotes, which really makes me want to pick up more of his stuff. The Importance of Being Earnest perhaps?<br /><br />Are there any books by Irish authors I need to get to? And if you're going to say Joyce just know I will probably ignore that suggestion.<br /><br />If you're curious the title of the post C\u00e9ad M\u00edle F\u00e1ilte means \"a hundred thousand welcomes\" in Gaelic. The only phrases I know in Irish are that one and  P\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in which means \"kiss my arse\".  I can welcome you and insult you. And of course, I can cheers you while drinking (Sl\u00e1inte). So really I have the important things down and anything else would just be icing on the cake.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:05+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:05+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-17T14:14:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7d5dde2238670002e5","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"St Patrick's Day","slug":"st-patricks-day","url":"/articles/tags/st-patricks-day"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7e5dde226419000621","title":"Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage","slug":"your-lively-talents-would-place-you-in-the-greatest-danger-in-an-unequal-marriage","url":"/articles/your-lively-talents-would-place-you-in-the-greatest-danger-in-an-unequal-marriage","body":"I just finished Pride and Prejudice and my happiness with the story was sustained through Part III when you finally see Darcy and Lizzy get togetherg.  Loose ends are tied up, people are paired off, happily ever after, etc etc. And there's the scene where Lizzy pisses off Lady Catherine. It's fantastic. Lady Catherine is a great character I'd never want to run into in real life, but man, is she fun to watch be a bitch. Since I don't have too much more I wanted to look at with the text itself, I figured I'd look at just a few of the plethora of book cover options.<br /><br /><br /> <img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/P%2526P234-cover.jpg\" /><br /><img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/P%2526P015+cover.jpg\" /><br />1. Twilight-esque - If this wasn't associated with Twilight I think I'd like it more. I like the simple flowers against the black background, regardless of if it has anything to do with the book at hand. Hopefully some Twilight fans picked up the book and actually enjoyed it. And I can laugh at those that picked it up expecting something along the lines of sparkling vampires and were disappointed.2. Ostentatious - OK, I don't actually think the room is that bad but wow that is a huge, overly decorated space. I'm just going to think of it as Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's place. I'm sure it could Darcy's as well, since that seems to be the style at the time. Not my favorite cover, kind of boring.3. Lovely Ladies - My copy of Sense &amp; Sensibility has this type of cover. Not my thing but there are a million cover options for P&amp;P that have the same style artwork as the cover, so obviously some people like it. It's not my aesthetic style, not what I picture Jane and Lizzy to look like (I assume that's who that is) and overall pretty dull.4. Busy Wallpaper - I feel like this one is somewhere just past 2 and 3. It's along those lines, with a background pattern that would fit right in #2's room and it includes a couple portraits like #3, albeit in a more modern style. I like the styling more and I'm a fan of that pattern so getting better.5. Burn-Your-Retinas Green - This is the cover I have, not because it's my favorite but because it was the cheapest copy at B&amp;N. If I had my Kindle at the time I would have just gotten an e-copy. That said, I don't actually hate the cover because it is so green and so bright. 6. Tim Burton-y - This is my favorite cover. It actually looks like this cover belongs on this cover, it's silhouette style, which was actually popular during the time the book was written and set, yet the style of Lizzy, Darcy, the trees, the house is very modern.<br />So which is your favorite or least favorite cover?  Is there another one you love or hate that I didn't include here?<br />I'm sorry if that was a spoiler for anyone but it really shouldn't have been. Not even because of the age of the book. Seriously, you had to know how this was going to turn out when you started reading. The journey, not the destination, is the fun part.<br /><br />Title quote from page 359<br />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:06+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:06+00:00","published_at":"2011-03-16T13:25:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e7e5dde226419000622","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Book covers","slug":"book-covers","url":"/articles/tags/book-covers"},{"value":"Pride and Prejudice","slug":"pride-and-prejudice","url":"/articles/tags/pride-and-prejudice"},{"value":"Jane Austen","slug":"jane-austen","url":"/articles/tags/jane-austen"}]}]},{"id":"53224e7e5dde2223b6000168","title":"If you could choose your literary family","slug":"if-you-could-choose-your-literary-family","url":"/articles/if-you-could-choose-your-literary-family","body":"<img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10-2.jpg\" /><br />This week the ladies over at <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-ten-tuesday-top-ten-characters.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a> ask us to pick 10 literary characters we wish could be part of our family.  As per usual, the only order to this list is the order I came up with the characters.<br /><br />1. Thursday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde - I'm fairly certain Thursday has been on about 1/2 of my lists but what can I say? I love the character and I'd love her to be an aunt of mine.<br /><br />2. Lizzy Bennet from Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen - I finally got around to reading the original Pride and Prejudice so the Bennet family is fresh in my mind. I'd love to have a sister like Lizzie. She's witty, kind and even within such a restrictive time period, seems free to do and say mostly as she pleases.<br /><br />3. Biff from Lamb by Christopher Moore - Funny, sarcastic and extremely loyal, I'd love to have Biff as a brother. He seems like a pain to his siblings when he's young, but really, who isn't a pain in the ass to their brothers and sisters at that point. So I think I'd want him to be the older brother.<br /><br />4. The Weasley family from the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling - Yeah, I'm counting the whole family in this one, cos really if you take one you have to take them all. The family is so loving without being sappy, how could you not want to join them? Plus they can do magic! Besides, I already have the hair to blend in. I'm thinking they'd be fantastic to have as aunt, uncle and a mess of cousins.<br /><br />5. Jonathan Strange from Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke - While we're on the subject of magic and how awesome that would be in (the right) family members, I can't forget Jonathan Strange. A gentleman that knows magic. He'd be a fun uncle<br /><br />6. Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee - Atticus is full of so much wisdom I would love to have him in the family and have access to his brain whenever I need advice. This is to say nothing of my dad, but if I'm going with a fictional one, it'd be this guy.<br /><br />7. Scout Finch from To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee - And while we're on this subject, I'd like to have Scout Finch as a little sister or younger cousin. She's not precocious like Oskar from EL&amp;IC, who I thought of adding to the list but realized he'd bug the hell out of me.

I've mentioned this before, but I've read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies a couples times, so I figured it was about time I read the original. Now I can quit feeling guilty. Here's the thing, I think I might like the zombie one better. Now before you start bludgeoning me with your Complete Works of Jane Austeng let me explain. The story, the characters, the plot of Austen's Pride and Prejudice are what primarily makes up the story of P&amp;P&amp;Z. The zombies are really secondary. If you don't like Austen's text, you'll never like the zombie version. I'm actually surprised Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has been so popular. I'd think the cross section of people who like Austen and people who like zombies is very small. So the zombie version is just Austen with a little something extra. Something extra that is absurd.<br /><br />I don't want to spend this whole post talking about zombies though. I do want to talk about Austen's work, which is brilliant. Even after reading the zombie one, I was still a little worried going into this that I'd find the work boring. I know, I know, I just finished saying that if you don't like Austen you won't like the zombie version. While I liked Austen's language and story, I wasn't sure if the zombie scenes were getting me through some of the parts that would drag more in the normal version. I've read Sense and Sensibility before and wasn't crazy about it. I have been pleasantly surprised. I've hardly been able to put the book down. Austen creates wonderful characters that are so smart and so well developed. They behave in a way that is true to their personalities and it never feels like they are doing anything as simply a means to progress the plot. <br /><br />Lizzy and Darcy are wonderful characters. The scenes where these two are together sparkle. There is so much wit and pride between them that it is a joy to read their interactions, and anytime they were separated I found myself flipping ahead to find out when the two would share the page again. Their love is clear early on, but obviously they must be kept apart for the duration of the book or else the story would be very short and boring. The events that keep them apart don't feel contrived, which means I don't have to spend the whole book thinking the main characters are morons, as is the case with most romantic comedies.<br /><br />Even the ridiculous characters make sense and feel real. Sure, Mrs. Bennet is obsessed with getting her daughters married off, but her worries are not unfounded. Her family will be very likely turned out of their home when Mr. Bennet dies and women didn't have many options for making their own way in the world. Marriage was essentially their only hope. I can laugh at Mrs. Bennet, but at the same time I can understand her worries.<br /><br />I'm happy I finally got around to this book. Not only because it's long overdue but because it gives me at least one book that is a) not written by an American author and b) written pre-1970s. I'm not quite finished with the book so there's a possibility of a second post coming up.<br /><br />As soon as I typed that I started to imagine different book related homicides. I bet those metal book marks could do some damage.  Or maybe millions of paper cuts and then the victim falls apart, a la tha<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZt8aanIJmQ\">t laser scene from one of the Resident Evil movies</a>.

Plus it fits into my goal of reading more lit that is by non-American writers from a time earlier than the 1970s! Still not winning the non-white author game, but it's a baby step.<br /><br />In the meantime, I wanted to let people know I have a page that lists out all of the books I've reviewed/written about/etc as well as links to those books.

To try to rectify this problem I decided to take Bate's book in stages and read something else in between. So while trying to figure out what to read next I decided why not give in to my short attention span and read Reduced Shakespeare: The Complete Guide for the Attention-Impaired [abridged] by Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor, two members of <a href=\"http://www.reducedshakespeare.com/\">The Reduced Shakespeare Company</a>. Granted I've read this before. A few times. But I love these guys, I love this book and it's a quick read.<br /><br />This book isn't just a biography of Shakespeare. That's just one small part because, as has been said, there isn't really much to truly be said about the man without making wild conjectures. The majority the book focuses on the plays because, of course, \"the play's the thing\". They describe the histories, tragedies and comedies in general and then they provide a plot summary for each of the plays with notable quotes and ratings. It's like super cliff's notes. They also list out movie versions of the plays and rate them based on how well they work as movies. It is a fantastic catalog with some of my favorite movies listed (Scotland, PA anyone) as well as some films I've yet to see. The sonnets and other poems also get their own section, with Martin and Tichnor's top 10 sonnets printed here. 116 is included (my personal favorite) so another win.<br /><br />Shakespeare's work makes up the bulk of the book, as it should, but there is one other section that is a lot of fun: Who Wrote This Stuff?: A reduced look at the Shakespearean Authorship controversy. Plus betting odds. I believe Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare but reading the anti-Stratfordian beliefs are fun. Also if I had to go with someone other than Shakespeare I'm going for Kit Marlowe because that one involves a faked death and spies! If I'm going to go with something ridiculous, I'm going all the way.<br /><br />The book is wonderful for people who want to learn more about Shakespeare as well as his ardent fans. For those unfamiliar this is a perfect introduction, like The Idiot's Guide to Shakespeare (which I also own) but wittier. Between this and the other Reduced Shakespeare Company's work <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-think-you-showed-lot-of-heart-lot-of\">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [abridged]</a> (which I previously wrote about), I prefer Complete Works [abridged].  But honestly, this is a close second for an unpretentious and funny foray into Shakespeare and his canon.<br /><br />Title quote from page 3<br /><br />Martin, Reed and Austin Tichenor.

I was studying in Italy at the time and my Italian professor asked the class if we had plans for March 8th. The entire class just looked at her confused.  Plans for what? (At least I wasn't alone.) She looked around the class with a look that was just as dumbfounded as the one we were giving her. \"Festa della donna, certo!\" \"Women's day, of course!\" I think there was an implied \"Duh\" in there as well. The town celebrates the day, though primarily with flowers and cake. I like both of those things, especially free, so that was pretty sweet. Of course the day should be more than that, a reflection of things women have accomplished and the strides we still need to make towards equality.

I've taken a number of Shakespeare classes in high school and college, I go to see the plays when I can and I've managed to accrue a decent library of books about the man and his work. I've even blogged about Shakespeare related works a couple timesg and I'm about to add another book to that list: Soul of the Age: A Biography of the Mind of William Shakespeare by Jonathan Bate.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Soul+of+the+Age+cover.jpg\" />What can this biography tell me about Shakespeare's life that the others (Will in the World by Greenblatt, The World as Stage by Bryson, Reduced Shakespeare by Reed and Tichnor) leave out?  Probably nothing. Shakespeare didn't leave a lot to go on so most biographies are about 10 pages of fact and then a lot of speculation. That (obviously) doesn't stop me from reading them! Bate decides to explore the seven ages as described by Jacques in As You Like It to explain the soul and mind of Shakespeare. The biography will not necessarily go in chronological order, so the \"schoolboy\" age includes both Shakespeare's time at King Edward's Grammar School but also jumps to a discussion about Prospero from The Tempest.  Bate explains \"Because of the power of memory and imagination -- two of Shakespeare's greatest gifts -- the mind does not obey the same rule of time as the entropic human body\" (xviii).<br /><br />Bate does acknowledge that you can't read the plays or sonnets as autobiography but that clues hidden within the text can help shine light on the man. When he does this, connects the plays to parts of Shakespeare's history, the text comes to life. I want to keep reading, to find out more. However, this type of analysis requires a lot of research, and unfortunately it appears Bate wanted to make sure you knew just how much research he did because he often goes off on tangents that are so marginally connected to Shakespeare you could skip that and not be missing anything about the man. I like the connection between Shakespeare's son-in-law, the doctor John Hall, and the change  in tone Shakespeare takes towards doctors, from the comedic to dignified, in his plays. What I don't like or particularly need are examples of Hall's recipes for enemas. The problem is there are a lot of moments like this, and I find myself checking how many pages are left or staring out into space instead of, you know, reading. So here's what I'm thinking:<br /><br />I'm going to continue to read this book. However, I'm going to read other things in between because this is just not sucking me in. My plan is to read one stage of life, read a different book, come back and read another stage of life, then a different book and so on and so forth. If suddenly Soul of the Age changes direction and really grabs hold of my attention, I'll keep reading it. So far that hasn't happened, but I'm not giving up!<br /><br />As it stands I've finished stage one: Infant. When Bate talked about Shakespeare, it was good. When his writing wandered from the topic, my mind wandered from the book. I hope the other stages are more interesting, but I'll find out after I read something else.<br /><br />Title quote is from As You Like It<br /><br />Bate, Jonathan.

I haven't really been able to answer the last few questions with anything interesting and rather than post something I didn't like, I decided to skip the hops. But I'm liking this week's question: Can literature be funny? What is your favorite humorous literary book?<br /><br />I'm actually not sure how to debate that literature can't be funny. Of course it can. Many times comedic works are overlooked in favor of a more serious topic, but that hardly means that literature must be stoic in order to be worthy. Shakespeare has an entire collection of comedies and some of them are actually funny! A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, hell even A Comedy of Errors has its moments, and that one can rely on a lot of slapstick. But maybe for this the plays don't count. A Comedy of Errors isn't half as much fun to read as it is to watch. But that's fine. I can step away from the Bard and find other examples.<br /><br />Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is hilarious. Yes, it has the schmaltzy story that has been told time and time (and time) again in about a million different adaptations, but most of those lose the comedy in it. I've written before about the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/why-is-door-nail-deadest-piece-of\">humor in A Christmas Carol</a> because growing up on those adaptations made me think Dickens, and other literary writers, weren't funny. They were serious and stodgy.  And then I actually sat down and read the book and I realized these versions don't know what they're doingg. Literature doesn't have to be stuffy, it can be fun and what else is hiding out there from me?<br /><br />Granted, most literary works are more serious or else they temper the comedy.

So here are my stats from February<br /><br />Number of books read<br />6<br /><br />Total Pages Read<br />1,652<br /><br />Percentage of fiction read<br />83%<br /><br />Percentage of female authors<br />50%<br /><br />Percentage of white authors<br />83%<br /><br />Percentage of authors from the US<br />83%<br /><br />Percentage of eBooks read<br />33%<br /><br />Percentage of re-reads<br />33%<br /><br />Books written by decade break out<br />2010s - 17%<br />2000s - 33%<br />1990s - 33%<br />1970s - 17%<br /><br />I'm doing pretty good on the number of pages read and even the female/male distribution. However, the books I read are still mostly by white authors (Toni Morrison is the 1 exception here) and mostly by US authors (Emma Donoghue is from Ireland). I'm not too worried about so little non-fiction being read. I expected as much and I actually have a non-fiction book I'm reading now. As long as there's a little bit of non-fiction I'm happy.<br /><br />I do think I need to work on my time period spread.  Everything is written within the last 50 years. I think I should probably throw something a bit older in there. Perhaps it's time to finally give Pride and Prejudice (no zombies this time) a whirl?<br /><br />How are your own reading stats looking? Happy with the way things are going?

OK, well that's not entirely true, since the last Moore book I read was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/were-all-fates-bastards\">Fool </a>back in August. But that was a re-read. Before that...well, that wasn't that long ago either. I read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/for-guy-that-maintains-low-profile\">Coyote </a><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/goog_1066893670\">Blue</a><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/you-cant-just-go-around-breaking\"> </a>back in June. What can I say, I need a regular fix of the guy. So to feed that fixg I read Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story. <br /><br />I had a couple reasons for picking up this particular book: I hadn't picked up any new Moore in awhile and I've read the sequel already. You Suck was actually the first Moore book I read and I didn't realize it was a sequel until I mentioned reading it in front of another Moore fan who was surprised (and I think a bit annoyed) that I hadn't read the first book in the trilogy. Moore wrote this back in '95 but I like reading it now, during the Twilight frenzy, to see a new way vampires can be represented. Moore mostly sticks to traditional vampire lore (they can't go in the sunlight, can turn to mist) but the story is told with his expected humor.<br /><br />The plot itself is fairly straight forward and predictable: a girl is transformed into a vampire and begins to learn the ropes of her new condition. She meets a human boy to help her out since she can't go out during the day (no sparkling!) and the 2 enter into a relationship. The vampire who turned her has been killing people around San Francisco and frames the murders on the couple. Evil must be vanquished, love prevails, etc, etc. The plot isn't the important part, the characters are. And they're wonderful. Jody, the newly turned vampire, is sweet, confused, cunning and vain. C. Thomas Flood, the aspiring author from Indiana as her boy toy is witty,  lovelorn and loyal. The Animals, the group Flood works with stocking groceries at a local market, are a riot. Cavuto and Rivera are the cops assigned to the string of murders who end up trying to figure out how to make sense of the supernatural things around them. (Open a rare book store and take up golfing are a couple options.) And of course there's my favorite character the \"Emperor of San Francisco and Protector of Mexico\". He's a homeless man who, along with his trusty Crusaders, Lazarus the golden retriever and Bummer the Boston terrier, who is truly concerned with the well-being of \"his subjects\" and is actually respected among many of the city's citizens.<br /><br />Moore's humor is absurd, subversive, witty, sarcastic and dark, and if you're anything like me you got more excited with each adjective I listed out there. This isn't my favorite Moore book, it lacks some of the deeper themes that are present in some of his other books (Lamb, A Dirty Job, Fool), but it is a lot of fun. I plan on picking up a new copy of You Suck very soon and the third part of the trilogy Bite Me. This may not be my favorite of his works but I really want to see where the rest of the story goes. I don't remember much of You Suck but knowing there was a sequel meant I already knew how a lot of this book was going to turn out, which hurt some of the thrill in reading the ending. The story was still fantastic but I didn't spend the last chapters on the end of my seat wondering what was going to happen. So if you do read the series you may as well read it in order.    <br /><br />Title quote from page 104<br /><br />Get it? Feed, fix, vampires. I slay me. Oh hey, there's another pun.

If I didn't have this blog and subsequently follow lots of other book bloggers, I don't think I'd know about this book and I'm certain I wouldn't have picked it up on my own. Actually as it stands I still didn't pick it up on my own (a friend gave it to me) but the point is by the time he gave me a copy I wanted to read it because of everything I'd heard about it from other bloggers. Apparently even without taking part in a challenge I've been able to move out of my normal reading comfort zone. Thanks all.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yl9WgJEZbWw/TWaLhHKoxCI/AAAAAAAAARQ/1LY3wzUQM4w/s200/Room+cover.jpeg\" />And with that, onto the book. If you haven't heard about it, Room is the story of Jack, a five year-old boy who's lived his entire life in a single room. The shed is the only reality he's ever know, the only world he's ever experienced as real. Jack's Ma was kidnapped long before Jack was born, and she's done all she can to make sure Jack grows up safe and well-adjusted in this prison. The story is told entirely from Jack's point of view, which in my opinion was both a pro and con to the book. From this narrator you experience a unique point of view as Jack describes Room and Outer Space. He has many times unintentionally funny and poignant and constantly grapples, as best as a 5 year old can, with the question of \"What is reality?\"<br /><br />I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as I can but I'm not the best judge of a spoiler so proceed at your own caution.<br />The basic plot is as follows: young girl is kidnapped, held prisoner in a specially constructed garden shed/prison and repeatedly raped. She has a son named Jack after a couple years in the shed and Jack grows up knowing only this single Room and the items in it. After 5 years Ma plans an escape and the two are free. Now I could very easily see this plot as a fairly predictable thriller, written from Ma's point of view and stopping here. But there's a reason Donoghue's book was shortlisted for so many awards and that's because she doesn't take this easy route. Instead the story is told from Jack's point of view and the escape happens right in the middle of the story. I think literally at the 50% mark according to my Kindle. The second half of the story deals with how Jack deals with this new reality that is so different from the world he's known his entire life.<br /><br />Pete over at <a href=\"http://petekarnas.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/emma-donoghue-room/\">What You Read</a> wrote a review of Room and discussed how books have to earn their happy endings for the story to be worth it. While the characters certain went through enough in the first part of the book to \"deserve\" their happy ending, the reader would have been shafted. The more interesting part to me was when both Jack and his Ma have to learn to live and re-live in this new Outside world. This reintegration is both funny and heartbreaking. I can't say the ending is necessarily \"happy\" but it's peaceful.<br /><br />I said Jack as narrator is both a pro and a con. I love having the story told from a child's point of view, however, I don't necessarily love a child's speech patterns.  Even a kid as precocious as Jack. Following a kid's grammar and syntax took some getting used to, at least for me. I wonder if this contributes to the fact that I liked the second half of the book better; by that time I was used to Jack's voice so I let it tell me the story instead of trying to figure out what he was talking about. That being said, using Jack as the narrator doesn't feel like a gimmick. The story Donoghue wrote couldn't have been told from an adult's point of view. It needs the simplicity and wonder that a child brings. The story could have easily been exploitative but Jack as the child doesn't see or fully understand all of the evil in the world or even in his situation.<br /><br />This is a really wonderful book. I don't know that it's my favorite read of the year but it's certainly one of the better books I've read, and I'm very happy I got the chance to check it out. I absolutely recommend it to, well anyone really.<br /><br />Title quote from location 2910.<br /><br />Donoghue, Emma. Room.

Something simple before pressing onto Emma Donoghue's Room. Luckily enough I acquired an e-copy of The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World by A. J. Jacobs. This is only my second re-read of the year. Back when I was in college this book made the rounds with my friends. A friendg bought the book and ended up recommending it to a friend, who then told our other friend they had to read it and etc, etc. While my friends and I have different personal tastes we all share a similar sense of humor and this one worked for most people.<br /><br />So A.J. decides after working at Entertainment Weekly and Esquire for so long he's filled his head is filled with pop culture trivia instead of real facts and his solution to fix this is to read the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica. This isn't going to give you any greater meaning into intelligence versus knowledge (though people argue the point with him several times) but it gives you the insight in what it would be like if your friend or loved one was reading this tome and decided to share all sorts of random facts at all times. Some of these tidbits stick with you. For example \"Abalones are a type of snail with five assholes\" (location 229). For whatever reason (probably because it's immature) I always remember this one. I've eaten abalone a couple times and while I don't always say this fact aloud, I think it every time.<br /><br />This could very easily be a boring book. Honestly it sounds like a boring topic. Read about a guy who read the Encyclopedia Britannica. Not much excitement there. But he tells the story with humor, sometimes sharing the information he's learned about certain topics, sometimes trying to get onto TV game shows (Jeopardy, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) and a lot of the time it's how his constant fact sharing annoys his friends and family. There is a bit of a sub-plot about A.J. and his wife trying to get pregnant but honestly, I enjoyed those detours less than the main story.<br /><br />It's a fun story, it's light, you can finish it quickly and you might learn a fact or two. And so you can experience the humor, here are a couple quotes I highlighted (I love my Kindle)<br /><br />Telling his father his plan:<br /><blockquote>\"I'm going to read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica\"<br />A pause. \"I hear that the Ps are excellent.\"</blockquote><br />I feel like this is my attention span:<br /><blockquote>In some ways, it's the perfect book for someone like me...who has the attention span of a gnat on methamphetamines</blockquote><br />Rap making it's way into the EB<br /><blockquote>Public Enemy and Wu-Tang Clan \"were among the popular purveyors of rap during the 1980s and 1990s.\" Purveyors of rap?  Now that's got to be the whitest phrase I've ever heard.\"</blockquote><br />A good how-to-be-a-know-it-all lesson<br /><blockquote>One secret to being a successful know-it-all is extreme confidence.</blockquote><br />This is the same friend that lent me <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/if-you-have-any-doubt-which-will-dent\">Kitchen Confidential</a>, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/dopplurbanology\">The City and The City</a> and numerous other books.<br /><br />Title quote from location 223<br /><br />Jacobs, A.

Well, I'm finished with the actual moving part. Packing is still a work in progress. I used to live at the top of a 5th floor walk-up in Boston and amazingly my legs have been unhappy with me since I made them run up and down those stairs to move boxes. Go figure. The fact that I've been hobbling around yesterday and today means packing is going fairly slowly, but I got my \"home office\" set up so that's something. Anyway...<br /><br />Another Tuesday, another Top Ten hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/02/kimberlys-top-ten-book-to-movie.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>. This week's topic: Top Ten Book to Movie Adaptations. I'll keep this lists to just movies I've seen AND books I've read. There are some great movies I've seen but never read the book (The Godfather), some books I've read but haven't seen the movie (Beloved) and some where I may have read the book and seen the movie but the movie was not anything to write home about (Pet Semetary)<br /><br />1. The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkein - I did not go into the first of the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, excited for the movie. We were looking for something for the whole family to see and my brother picked the movie. I knew of the book but I'd never read it. And much to my surprise, I loved the movie. I went out and read the book and was very meh on it. So I decided to wait before I continued reading the trilogy until I saw the movie. I didn't want to ruin anything for myself. While I loved the movies (even going to the midnight showing of Return of the King) I couldn't make it through the books. I finished Two Towers and started RotK but couldn't make it through.<br /><br />2. American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis - Another movie that I love. It's dark, it's violent, it's satirical and it stars Christian Bale. Again I figured \"well I like the movie so much, I should read the book.\" While I don't agree with censorship, having read it I understand why Australia and NZ sell the book wrapped in plastic. The movie took the main purpose of the book, emphasised the ridiculousness and de-emphasised the cannibalism. The business card scene is my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />3. The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris - This is a wonderful movie and deserves the accolades it has collected. The book is good and certainly entertaining, but this is another case where the movie surpasses the book, specifically Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br /><br />4. A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare - The 1999 movie version with Kevin Kline, Christian Bale (oh hay, look who showed up on the list again) Anna Friel, Stanley Tucci and I could go on and on naming people in it. It's a light-hearted movie and while there are no Oscar-worthy performances, everyone seems comfortable with the language so you can focus on how much fun everyone is having.<br /><br />5. High Fidelity by Nick Hornby - Sometimes I like both the book and the movie and High Fidelity is one of those times. Relationships and musical snobbery make for a great story with some wonderful characters. There are some changes between the 2 media (the movie takes place in Chicago while the book is in London, a couple characters are dropped from the movie) but the spirit and humor are consistent.<br /><br />6. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl - I'm talking about the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie. I loved Roald Dahl's books as a kid. This movie used to terrify me, and I think with good reason. I remember thinking Violet Beauregard when she becomes the blueberry being especially scary. It has a quirky, slightly off center feel the whole time and, once I got over my fears, I found a very fun movie.<br /><br />7. The Princess Bride by William Goldman - This has been a favorite movie of mine for a long time and when I found out it was based on a book I had to read it. Unlike my literary failures with 1 and 2 on this list, the book is just as fun as the movie. It has a slightly different flavor from the movie, with an extra subplot involving the narrator's dad only reading him \"the good parts\" of an old European novel satirizing excesses of the royalty. And the relationship between Buttercup and Wesley, while still based on love, is less idealized and involves much more bickering. Writing about this makes me want to go watch the movie now.<br /><br />8. Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton - Another case where a fun movie came out of an entertaining book. It's certainly not Shakespeare but it was a fun summer movie, especially since I love dinosaurs when I was little. So it's a bit cheesy and predictable. Who cares? The lawyer got eaten off the toilet by a T Rex. <br /><br />9. Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll - I haven't seen the newest version that Tim Burton did so I'm referring to the 1951 Disney version. This has been my favorite of the Disney movies since I was little. Like some of the other movies I have on this list, it's an odd story with a lot of fun and beautiful visuals. And the Cheshire Cat is one of my favorite characters. I still think of crescent moons as \"Cheshire Cat\" moons.<br /><br /><br />10. The Green Mile by Stephen King - I'm a fan of King's horror stories but is always nice to see something different because he can do non-horror well. The Shawshank Redemption is a good example but since I haven't read the novella, I'll focus on The Green Mile. The movie and the book are both very similar and they both tell a touching story of forgiveness and redemption.<br /><br />Hey, look at that! I made it to 10. I think this is only the second time I've managed that. <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-10-scariest-books\">Scary stories</a> was my other success, if you're curious.

But I didn't live here for 8 years because I was trapped here and now that I'm leaving I wanted to take the opportunity to list out the places in particular that I will miss in this city.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/coolidge_corner.jpg\" /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_Corner\">Coolidge Corner.</a>  I lived in an apartment in Coolidge for 2 years, which is by far the longest I stayed in one place during my time in Boston (and Boston areas).  I would have stayed here longer if I could have.  I went from a 1000sq ft, brand new apartment with all the latest amenities into a 500sq ft, old apartment with nothing and I couldn't have been happier because it was in Coolidge. It has shops, restaurants, an old theater, a great bookstore, strange characters and wonderful events.  I never grew tired of it.  If the option comes up to move back to Boston, I want to be back here or not come back at all.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/booksmith.jpg\" />While I'm on the subject of Coolidge Corner I want to mention my favorite bookstore, <a href=\"http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/\">The Brookline Booksmith</a>. My pie in the sky, literary dream is to own a bookstore and this is the place I would want to run.  The place is certainly not large but they have a nice selection of new books (although they never carried any Fforde...) and the basement was all used ones.  They also held events, book signings, book clubs and the staff had great recommendations.  A little corner of the store was devoted to a random collection of things from the book related (journals, reading lights) to the random (Moses action figures).  It was my go-to gift buying store.  And they would do promotions with the theater across the street if their basement couldn't hold everyone.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/coolidge-corner-theatre.jpg\" /><a href=\"http://www.coolidge.org/\">The Coolidge Corner Theater</a> is an old art deco style independent movie theater.  Because they were independent they didn't get the new movies right when they came out but they made up for this by showing lots of classic movies and hold events.  I mentioned in an <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-goes-by-many-names-crisis-dark-years\">earlier post</a> that the theater showed Night of the Living Dead and then had a Zombie expert come to speak.  I missed that (sad) but I was there for: a screening of Indian Jones and the Ark of the Covenant: The Adaptation which was a shot for shot remake made by some kids between the ages of 12 - 18 (it took them awhile to film...) right after the movie came out, a midnight showing of Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog complete with people acting out both the movie and the musical commentary and the 1967 production of The Taming of the Shrew with members of the Reduced Shakespeare Company acting out parts of the Complete Works (abridged) before the show.  I also so normal movies there as well: Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, Adventureland, (500) Days of Summer.  <br /><br />The Coolidge Corner Theater is my favorite theater in Boston but there are a couple more I want to point out: the <a href=\"http://www.somervilletheatreonline.com/somerville-theatre/\">Somerville Theater</a> in Davis Sq serves beer and wine as well as playing fun movies (I saw Bruno there) and hosting concerts (I saw <a href=\"http://www.cityandcolour.ca/home.php\">City and Colour</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lissie.com/\">Lissie</a> there).  The AMC in Harvard Sq is a normal movie theater for the most part but ever Saturday and all Halloween weekend they do midnight showings of Rocky Horror, complete with the <a href=\"http://www.fullbodycast.org/\">Full Body Cast</a> doing a pre-show and acting out the movie.  <br /><br />I mentioned the Somerville Theater is a good place to see live acts but there are some other venues I went to over and over again.  Formally Avalon, <a href=\"http://www.houseofblues.com/venues/clubvenues/boston/\">House of Blues</a> is my most often visited venue, because it's where a lot of the acts go.  I've seen <a href=\"http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/\">Jimmy Eat World</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/\">Dropkick Murphys</a> a few times here as well as some other acts like <a href=\"http://www.streetlightmanifesto.com/\">Streetlight Manifesto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.benfolds.com/\">Ben Folds</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.thedise.com/rockclub/index.html\">Paradise</a> is walking distance from my apartment in Coolidge (another reason I loved it there) and was a much smaller venue which means it didn't matter where you stood, you had a good view.  I've seen <a href=\"http://www.jakobdylan.com/\">Jakob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rxbandits.com/\">Rx Bandits</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.bouncingsouls.com/\">Bouncing Souls</a> and others there. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheum_Theatre_%28Boston,_Massachusetts%29\">The Orpheum</a> has seats, which usually makes me sad (I like to be able to jump around during concerts) but the place is pretty small so you have a great view and such fun acts go here. I saw Jimmy Eat World (I see them a lot) and <a href=\"http://www.eddieizzard.com/\">Eddie Izzard</a> here.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/allstar+sandwich.jpg\" /><br /><a name='more'></a>Then there is all of the food in Boston I'm going to miss.  I love food so this section might be a little long.  <a href=\"http://www.allstarsandwichbar.com/\">All-Star Sandwich Bar</a> is probably my favorite restaurant, or at least my go-to place.  Amazing sandwiches on a rotating specials menu.  They have a regular menu that I've never bothered to order off of because I was too busy having Texas Reubens.  Also they give you free Oreos and high-fives!  It's next door to <a href=\"http://christinasicecream.com/index.htm\">Christina's Homemade Ice Cream</a>, which has my favorite ice cream anywhere. They have unusual flavors that are very straightforward.  My favorite is Burnt Sugar which tastes just like the top of a creme brulee.  The first time I was there my friend was telling me to get it.  I was reluctant because I wasn't sure what it would taste like.  Sure they said burnt sugar, but what does it really taste like.  I got a sample and what do you know, it tasted exactly like what they said it would.  I never questioned the flavors after that and was never disappointed.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.toro-restaurant.com/\">Toro</a> in Boston's South End (not to be confused with Southie) is another favorite restaurant.  It's a tapas place and they don't take reservations, which is nice because your meal is expected to take hours to get through.  It usually does for me anyway.  My favorite dishes there are the \"Maz asado con aliolio y queso cotjia\" (grilled corn with aliolio, lime, espelette pepper and aged cheese; house speciality) and \"Asado de huesos\" (roasted bone marrow with radish citrus salad and oxtail marmalade).  My mouth is watering thinking about them.<br /><br />If I wanted a fancier night out, I'd go to <a href=\"http://www.atlanticfishco.com/\">Atlantic Fish Co</a>. It's a nice upscale place that never feels stuffy.  If anyone ever asks me for a nice place to go for a special occasion I recommend this place.  I also recommend it if anyone ever suggests going to Legal Seafood.  Legal is OK but Atlantic is superior.  I usually go for the house recommended dish and the key lime pie is fantastic.<br /><br />A major Boston area dish is the lobster roll.  I've tried to sample them all over the city and I have 2 favorite places to get them: <a href=\"http://neptuneoyster.com/\">Neptune Oyster</a> in the North End and <a href=\"http://www.therawbar.com/index.html\">Raw Bar</a> on the Cape.  Neptune is a tiny tiny place and usually has a long wait but the Irish bar Goody Glover is across the street so it's easy to grab a drink while waiting for a table.  Besides both their lobster rolls, hot and cold, are worth the wait.  Raw Bar has a simple yet huge lobster roll this is perfect after spending a day at the beach.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/gari.jpg\" />While on the subject of seafood, I want to say I love sushi and I have a couple favorite sushi places.  <a href=\"http://www.symphonysushi.com/\">Symphony Sushi</a> is near Northeastern campus, where I went to college, and became our defacto weekend lunch place.  I think for about a year a group of us went there weekly and it's still my favorite sushi place.  If I wanted something a little less casual than Symphony I would go to <a href=\"http://www.garifusion.com/\">Gari</a>, which was right around the corner from my Coolidge apartment (see how great that place was).  Their Torched King Salmon Roll is my favorite roll I've ever had anywhere. <br /><br />I could go on and on (and on and on) about restaurants in Boston that I've loved so I'll stop now because I need to stop somewhere. I'm happy to be starting a new chapter but for all its faults I will miss Boston.  And who knows, I may end up back here again.<br /><br />For now I look forward to a new part of my life. I'll be living in Long Island (with many, many trips into the city because the suburbs make me sad) and even working from home for awhile. I think I'll miss interacting with people face-to-face but on the other hand, I get to wear pajamas all day. Give and take. And after that the plan is to go back to school, because I thought being debt-free wasn't enough of a challenge and have decided to rectify that.<br /><br />I'll miss you Boston.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:12+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:12+00:00","published_at":"2011-02-18T14:13:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e845dde22641900062c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Boston","slug":"boston","url":"/articles/tags/boston"}]}]},{"id":"53224e845dde22fdcf00054f","title":"Literary Love Stories","slug":"literary-love-stories","url":"/articles/literary-love-stories","body":"<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10.jpg\" />First up, happy Valentine's Day. Hope you a) had a romantic dinner with your loved one (or ones. No judging) b) enjoyed watching bad romantic movies with friends c) treated it like any other day and didn't really think about it too much d) anything else you may have done to celebrate/anti-celebrate. However you were hoping to spend it anyway.<br /><br />In the spirit of Valentine's Day, this week's Top Ten Tuesday hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/02/julias-top-ten-favorite-love-stories.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a>: what are your Top Ten Favorite Literary Love Stories? I'm trying to keep my list focused on the stories instead of just <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-ten-literary-couples-and-fellow_28\">great literary couples</a>, which was already a top list.<br /><br />1. A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare - I wouldn't call this my favorite of Shakespeare's plays, but it is my favorite. I actually own 5 copies of this one: 2 in Complete Work anthologies, 1 Arden version, 1 version from the First Folio and 1 version in Italian. And while I wouldn't say this is the best love story out there, it is ridiculous, and really that's all I look for in a love story.<br /><br />2. Pride and Prejudice (and Zombies) by Jane Austen (and Seth Grahame-Smith) - Because I haven't read the normal P&amp;P (it's on my shelf, I'll get to it) I'm going with the zombie version. And anyway, the love story is the same in both of them. Spunky girl and stoic guy trade verbal (and in the zombie version physical) jabs.<br /><br />3. Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare - Anytime I think of love stories I think of Shakespeare.  The love story between Hero and Claudio is meh, but the dynamic between Beatrice and Benedick is fantastic. The added bonus to this one is I can't help but think of the 1993 movie version with Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson as Benedick and Beatrice (wonderful) and Keanu Reeves as Don John (hilarious and not on purpose).<br /><br />4. You Suck: A Love Story by Christopher Moore -  Look, \"love story\" is right in the title! This is actually the second part of a Moore vampire trilogy (no one sparkles) but I didn't know what when I picked up the book so this is the only one of that series I've read. It has typical Moore wit and sarcasm and a cute story between a couple of San Franciscan vampires.<br /><br />5. Romeo &amp; Juliet by Shakespeare - I'm trying not to make this list all Shakespeare, but honestly, love stories aren't really my normal genre of choice, so I don't have many stories to choose from. I'm attempting to spread out the Shakespeare but I'm failing a bit. Anyway, R&amp;J is the obvious love story choice. Even if I think Romeo and Juliet are acting like angsty, impulsive teens, at least they whole heartedly believe in their love.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Valentine+Book.jpg\" />OK, I'm actually out of love stories unless I just go ahead and list a bunch of Shakespeare ones (Othello, As You Like It, Twelfth Night) I may as well stop. I actually gave myself extra time to try to come up with this list and really thought I'd make it to ten. I guess there's always next week.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:12+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:12+00:00","published_at":"2011-02-15T12:43:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e845dde22fdcf000550","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e855dde2223b6000170","title":"\"Book stores are going away.\"","slug":"book-stores-are-going-away-dot","url":"/articles/book-stores-are-going-away-dot","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Borders+Closed.jpg\" />Borders has filed for Chapter 11, and according to a story in the WSJ.com, they're expecting to close 50% of their locations within the next 5 years and 90% within the next 10. And then we have the quote I've used in the title: \"Book stores are going away\". Are they?<br /><br />While the statement is sad, it seems to make sense. The world wide interwebs seem to have taken over the book market. Amazon's FY2009 media sales (books, DVDs, music) were almost $6 billion, eclipsing Barnes &amp; Noble stores ($4.3 billion) and Borders/Walden ($2.65 billion). I know there are people that will buy practically anything online, but I usually like to actually physically handle the item before I purchase it. But books aren't in that category. I can be fairly certain I know what I'm going to get if I order a book (or a DVD) online. The only reason I don't order more books online is that I am amazingly impatient and want the book immediately. Amazon's sales show I'm not the only one that orders books online, and those online sales are hurting the brick and mortar places.<br /><br /> I said one of the reasons I don't order books online more often is that I like the immediate satisfaction of having the book in my hand right away. Well the other thing chipping away at those book sales are eBooks. This past summer Amazon announced that eBooks outsold hardbacks. Clearly eBooks don't need an actual bookstore to sell their wares. So do these points mean that bookstores are going to be wiped from cities and suburbs? All book buying will need to directly involve a computer?<br /><br />I don't doubt that online sales and eBooks are hurting bookstores in general, but I wonder if the bookstores that end up disappearing don't end up being the bigger chains. Will the smaller bookstores be able to weather this storm?  As it stands they seem to be closing at an alarming rate and people seem to have to make a special journey to a local bookstore out of a sense of community. How will their sales be affected by Borders closing? Will online and eBook sales more strongly affect the big box stores, leaving the small sellers behind when the dust has cleared? Or will they be taken down as well, and in the future we won't be able to walk into a store a pick up a new book? I've obviously not done any sort of analysis on what the answers could be but does anyone have any thoughts on the topic?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704329104576138353865644420.html?mod=wsj_share_twitter\">Chapter 11 for Borders, New Chapter for Books</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fonerbooks.com/booksale.htm\">Book Sales Statistics</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/technology/20kindle.html\">E-Books Top Hardcovers at Amazon</a>","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:13+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:13+00:00","published_at":"2011-02-14T15:38:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e855dde2223b6000171","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Book sales","slug":"book-sales","url":"/articles/tags/book-sales"}]}]},{"id":"53224e855dde2238670002ec","title":"But she had gone on a real trip, and now she was different","slug":"but-she-had-gone-on-a-real-trip-and-now-she-was-different","url":"/articles/but-she-had-gone-on-a-real-trip-and-now-she-was-different","body":"I'd expected to write a few posts about this book as I tried to take it all in. There is a lot to take in but I didn't want to stop reading. Or rather, I didn't want to stop reading and take time to write. I did have to put the book down a few times and gather my thoughts but I wasn't ready to write anything down yet.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Sula+cover.jpg\" />Morrison never makes her work easy. Her characters never feel like caricatures. They are contradictions, at once beautiful and ugly, good and evil. Ambiguous. Sula takes place in a predominately black town in Ohio from the years 1919 - 1965. It's the story of girlhood friendship between Nel Wright and Sula Peace, of a tight-knit African-American community in a racist world, of the fear of death and change and of the ambiguity of love: a mother's love for her children, love between friends and love between lovers.<br /><br />Sula isn't a long book (173 pages in my edition) but it takes time to make it through. At least after each chapter, and sometimes in the middle, I had to stop and digest what I'd read, what had happened. I read SparkNotes after each chapter to compare my thoughts to their analysis. Sometimes I came to the same conclusions, sometimes it showed me something new and sometimes I didn't agree. The beginning is my favorite part and I found myself stopping a lot early on. Why did Shadrack initiate and celebrate a National Suicide Day? Why did Helene smile at the racist train conductor and why did the black soldiers react to her the way they did? What did Sula's birthmark mean and how did that meaning change for different characters at different times? It isn't confusing to follow the story but just to understand what's and why it happened.<br /><br />It's a beautiful book but a sad one. Not depressing, not melodramatic but sad. Most of the books I read are humorous. Sula is not funny. It does not temper moments with humor. The characters might laugh and dance (life isn't always awful) but there's nothing there for the reader to laugh at. It wouldn't suit the story if there was. I was going to say it would make the story as strong, but I don't think something being a comedy automatically means it's lightweight. The book's also not what I would consider quirky, like Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close. It's mostly a straightforward narrative with a lot hidden just below the surface.<br /><br />There's one character in particular that I liked reading about, although I can't really describe her without spoilers so if you've read the story, or don't particularly care if know plot details ahead of time, read on.<br /><br />gSpoilery spoilers<br />I mentioned the characters are contradictions. Eva Peach, titular Sula's grandmother, is my favorite character. She's the strong and proud patriarch of the Peace household and resides over her family and a variety of boarders. Her husband BoyBoy left her with \"$1.65, five eggs, three beets and no idea what or how to feel,\" (32). From these seemingly insurmountable circumstances Eva manages to keep her children alive and in turn keeping them alive is what keeps her alive. But she was never able to play with the children or express her love as any sort of affection because \"there wasn't no time\" (69).<br /><br />This being said, Morrison seems almost incapable of creating a character the can be strong a simple. That's wrong. I believe Morrison is capable of creating a simple, two-dimensional character; she's just a better author than that. Eva Peace fiercely loves her three children, especially his son Plum. Plum comes home from war without hope but with a heroin addiction. Eva can't stand to watch her son destruct in this way so she holds him tight, rocks him for awhile and then douses him in kerosene and sets him on fire. Eva takes \"I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it\" very literally. Is this just an act of violence? Is it an act of love, saving him from his addiction? Is it selfish? A little of everything? See these are the complications Morrison throws at you.<br />Spoilers over<br /><br />I'm glad Tony decided to challenge himself this month by reading books that are either by African-American authors or deal with the African-American experience and I'm glad he encouraged others to join him. I brought Sula with me with the hope that I would re-read it, but I don't know without this challenge if I would have ever gotten around to it. I can easily talk myself out of things.<br /><br /><br />Title quote from page 28<br /><br />Morrison, Toni. Sula.

I am not good with kids. I hear when they're your own you like them. Despite my fear of these tiny people, I do like this topic presented by Lori over at <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/02/loris-top-ten-characters-and-literary.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a> so I'll try to come up with a list of literary names I'd give kids and not animals.<br /><br />1. Thursday; Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde - Obviously I don't have a good grasp of what type of name won't get a child picked on. Or as I said I'm not good with kids and don't actually care that much cos I really like this name. And is it honestly stranger than being named after a season? (I also like the names Autumn and Summer.)<br /><br />2. Jasper - Hey, while we're on this topic, I kinda like this name too.Oh man, if I have kids they are getting screwed in the name department. I'll try to come up with some good nicknames.<br /><br />3. Zooey; Franny and Zooey by Salinger - I know in the stories Zooey is a boy but I like it for a girl's name.<br /><br />4. Harper - I am totally stealing this from Christina at <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2011/02/top-ten-tuesday-christinas-children.html\">The Blue Bookcase</a> but I like this as a first name. <br /><br />5. Portia; The Merchant of Venice by Shakespeare - I love Shakespeare so I have a feeling a few more of his characters will sneak onto the list. Portia may have been a hypocrite (see \"Quality of mercy\" speech directly before making Shylock convert) but she's at least a strong, intelligent female character.<br /><br />6. Cordelia; King Lear by Shakespeare - Oh here's another name. This is more because I like the sound of the name and less for the character.<br /><br />OK that's actually as many as I can come up with without forcing it.

I've taken up this challenge and decided to read Sula by Toni Morrison, mostly because I already own the book AND I have it with me. So essentially, I'm doing this because it's easy. Rather coming up with the book is easy. Morrison on the other hand is never easy. She's worth the challenge, but she makes you work for it.<br /><br />My copy of Sula comes with a foreword by Morrison in which she discusses the experience of being an African-American writer and writing about female characters. Sounds like just the thing to read into for this challenge huh?<br /><br />Even before getting into the actual story Morrison has given me a lot to think about. Here are some key points  from the intro I want to keep in mind during my reading:<br /><br />Morrison discussing the political nature forced onto African-American writing<br /><blockquote>\"If Phillis Wheatly wrote \"The sky is blue,\" the critical question was what could blue sky mean to a black slave woman? If Jean Toomer wrote \"The iron is hot,\" the question was how accurately or poorly he expressed chains of servitude.\" (xi-xii)</blockquote>Female characters I'll encounter in Sula<br /><blockquote>\"Outlaw women are fascinating -- not always for their behavior, but because historically women are seen as naturally disruptive and their status is an illegal one from birth if it is not under the rule of men.\" (xvi)</blockquote>And finally the questions Morrison wanted to ask with this novel<br /><blockquote>\"What is friendship between women when unmediated by men? What choices are available to black women outside their own society's approval? What are the risks of individualism in a determinedly individualistic, yet racially uniform and socially static, community?\" (xiii)</blockquote>I have a feeling this book is going to take me awhile to get through. It's a short but dense book, like her others, and Morrison chooses her words carefully. I find myself putting the book down after a few pages and absorbing exactly what it is she's said. With that I'm both nervous and excited for where this book will lead me.<br /><br />Morrison, Toni. Sula.

I know it's wrong to ignore an entire section of the bookstore based on a few bad apples but I did. I figured it didn't matter. If I hadn't <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/reaping-benefits-of-book-giveaway\">received this copy of Speak for free</a>, I never would have given it a second glance. And that would have been a shame because then I would have missed out.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Speak+cover.jpg\" />Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is a difficult and yet simple (not easy) novel. Anderson says \"Speak is not just a book about rape. Speak is a book about depression\" (204). Obviously a book dealing with rape and depression is not going to be a necessarily pleasant read.  Add to the fact that the main character, Melinda, is only 13 when raped and the topic gets that much harder. Anderson has a definite writing style that works well for the genre and the topic. It would have been easy for the book to focus on the violence but she doesn't. The book focuses on Melinda's school year and how she wrestles with her emotions and her guilt and her pain. Not only is Speak not just a book about rape, I'd say it's primarily about depression. It's just set off by that singular moment.<br /><br />The book is told from Melinda's point of view. The sentences are short and to the point, without any flowery descriptions. It feels like this could have come straight from the mind of a teenager and indeed Anderson mentions researching teen speak by hanging out a Taco Bell and mall food courts (204).<br /><br />Ben over at <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/01/laurie-halse-anderson-speak-1999.html\">Dead End Follies</a> says the book got under his skin and I have to agree. I started it without any real expectation that I would really like it. I didn't assume I'd hate it, I just assumed I wouldn't remember it. Then I was reading it and I couldn't put it down. And more than that I started getting angry at Melinda (more on that in a second). If I don't care about what I'm reading or what I'm watching, it stands to reason that I don't care what happens to the characters. But when I noticed myself feeling something other than apathy, I knew the book was getting to me.<br /><br />gThis part will have some spoilers in it. Although I already told you Melinda gets raped so really, that's the only surprise. And I ruined that for you already. Sorry about that.<br />Yes, I was angry at Melinda. I was angry at her for a lot of the beginning of the book. Am I that much of an asshole that I'm actually angry at a young girl who is a rape victim? Apparently, but please hear me out before you hunt me down with pitchforks. I was mad at her because she was acting like a victim. Now, I don't actually think Melinda did anything wrong or anything unusual or anything different than I would have done if I had gone through what she did. But I was angry that it happened at all and I, as the reader, didn't have the details as to exactly what happened. So my anger got filtered over to her. Which is unfair. And wrong. And please understand I would never blame a rape victim for their attack. I don't blame Melinda for her attack and she's not even real. But as a fictional character and one I could argue with, I just wanted to shake her and yell at her to quit being a victim. And maybe stab the guy in the face. I get stabby when rape is involved. <br /><br />So yeah, when I started yelling at the character (in my head. I'm not that crazy) I knew the book was getting to me.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is that the ending came too quickly. I felt like we spent so long in the beginning watching Melinda be sad and then the ending was rushed. She finally starts to turn and confront what has happened and begins to open up, beings to speak, then BAM the book is over. I would have liked to see her strength grow more before all of a sudden we're done. Although I don't have any interest in a possible sequel Anderson is considering writing. I think the story has been told and while I like Melinda I think any follow up to her will cheapen the original story.<br />Phew spoilers over. And hopefully those of you that read it do not want to attack me. Or even if you do still want to, please don't.<br /><br />Reading and enjoying Speak does not suddenly mean that I'm going to start reading a bunch of YA. It just means that if someone whose opinion I trust recommends a YA book I won't so quickly turn my nose up at it. And if you get the chance you should check it out. It's a very quick read so if you have a few hours you can finish it.<br /><br />Title quote from page 32<br /><br />Anderson, Laurie Halse. Speak.

I'm far too indecisive to commit to reading on any sort of schedule. And putting myself on a schedule or giving myself a reading list suddenly makes my hobby feel like work, at which point I'll just quit reading. I can be a little kid like that.  To demonstrate exactly how indecisive I am, I can't even stick to my \"I won't participate in any challenges\" statement. It's like as soon as I claim I'll do one thing I need to do the opposite. It's annoying, I know.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bhm.gif\" />So I kind of signed up for a challenge.

That is literally all of the commitment I am giving. It's pathetic and you are more than welcome to make fun of me for it. But I am trying.<br /><br />Here's my plan: the challenge set up is to read at least one African-American centric book in the month of February. Tony is going to try to do it for the entire month. Not only is that too much of a schedule for me, the majority of my books are in Long Island, so I'm making due with a limited book shelf and I don't want to buy a bunch of books for a challenge. It's sad that I have so few African-American centric books with me but at least I have one: Sula by Toni Morrison. I have read it before for a Toni Morrison class but all I can remember is I liked it more than some of her others. Hopefully I'm remembering this correctly.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you're into, drop a line for Tony. I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that I can actually complete this challenge.

You'll find the book in the humor section because zombies are funny but this isn't a humorous, sarcastic story. Actually it's not even a story. There's no narrative and no characters. It's more like the Worst Case Survival handbooks.

You need someone who knows how to use several types of weapons? Someone with basic medical, mechanical, agricultural knowledge? Now all I know is all of the skills I would need that I do not have.<br /><br />For those who like putting together zombie contingency plans (and who doesn't??) this book is a lot of fun and will most likely destroy whatever plan you've put together with its logic. As much logic as can be applied to a zombie uprising that is.<br /><br />As stated on the back of the book, here are the top 10 lessons for surviving a zombie attack:<br />1. Organize before they rise!<br />2. They feel no fear, why should you?<br />3. Use your head: cut off theirs<br />4. Blades don't need reloading<br />5. Ideal protection = tight clothes, short hair<br />6. Get up the staircase, then destroy it<br />7. Get out of the car, get onto a bike<br />8. Keep moving, keep low, keep quiet, keep alert!<br />9.

I know I've mentioned this before, so apologies for the dead horse being beaten, but I loved the stats <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2010/12/year-in-reading-2010.html\">Brenna</a> put together and decided to steal her idea and do it myself this year. Not one to miss a chance for an easy personal wrap-up, here's how my stats are looking for the end of January.g  I'm only including books I've finished in the month. <br /><br />Number of books read<br />4<br />Total pages read<br />1,565 <br /><br />Percentage of fiction read<br />50%<br /><br />Percentage of female authors<br />50% <br /><br />Percentage of white authors<br />100%<br /><br />Percentage of authors from the US<br />100%<br /><br />Percentage of books written in the 2000s<br />100%<br /><br />Percentage of re-reads<br />0% - this one is surprising, for me anyway. I tend to re-read a lot.  <br /> <br /><br />So I'm doing pretty good on my male to female split and that's about it.  Other than that they're all white from the US and their books were written in the 2000s. I'll need to work on that.  Unfortunately the next book I have on the list is also by a white author from the US, written in the 2000s.<br /><br />I'm not worried about the fiction/non-fiction split.

This time I didn't. I couldn't put the book down. Here's my normal book review posting schedule: I start reading the book. Once I've gathered my initial thoughts I'll post. Then once I've finished, I wrap up with my last thoughts.  Maybe the book lived up to my expectations.  Maybe half way through the story fell apart. Maybe I want to talk about one specific scene or quote or whatnot.  If there was something really interesting I wanted to talk about, or if the book is particularly long there may be some additional posts in there. This time I never wanted to stop and gather my thoughts. I just wanted to read more. And then all of a sudden the book was over. So here we go. <br /><br />This is the first book I'm reading since having read a book on my Kindle and I have to say I'm missing the notes/highlighting feature all ready.  I hate writing in books so I always end up forgetting passages I want to go back to.  I'm happy I was sitting at home reading when I came across the title quote because it gave me the chance to immediately write it down here.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Extremely_Loud+cover.jpg\" />I read Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer.  I'd seen this book for awhile, in bookstores on the tables in the middle of the walkways, with staff recommendations or new paperbacks or noteworthy fiction. I use those tables anytime I don't have a specific book in mind. I always noticed this book because that bright hand stands out on the table but it never stood out enough for me to pick it up and look at it closer.  I want to thank Brenna at <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2010/11/extremely-loud-incredibly-close.html\">Literary Musings</a> for her review of this book because it made me finally get the book myself. <br /><br />The prose is wonderful and lyrical without feeling contrived or forced.  Safran Foer manages to give the different chapters, narrated by different characters, their own voices while still maintaining the lyrical quality. I know this is trite and others have said it, but this book had me both laughing and crying.<br /><br />At first I found the main character, nine year old Oskar Schell to unbelievable. He's a bit too precocious at times and it's difficult to rectify his age which his actions.g Having said that, Oskar really grew on me and his chapters are my favorites. I may not believe a child with his disposition can be real but I love watching him interact with the characters around NYC. Early in the novel his behavior took me out of the story but as it went on I came to accept it. If I thought about it too long it would bother me again until the end when I went with it. By the end I couldn't imagine Oskar acting any other way.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. It's beautiful and touching and painful and wonderful. It never felt like Safran Foer was trying to show you how clever his writing is and I never felt manipulated by the story.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this book would read on an e-reader.  Safran Foer plays around with text formatting and images and I'm not sure exactly how well that will translate to a Kindle or Nook.<br /><br /> I actually have the same problem with Ender's Game.  Where else will you find a comparison between Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close and Ender's Game?  Probably several places, but you'll find it here too.<br /><br />Title quote from page 160<br /><br />Safran Foer, Jonathan. Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close.

A blog doesn't have to read and write about the same books I read (that would be boring) but I like a blog that talks about books I do like.  And this is my nice way of saying if a book is all YA, I'm going to skip it. There is a large audience for those blogs so at least I know they aren't wanting of fans.</li></ul>Once I get through all of these steps, I'll follow.  Some blogs I follow more closely than others but I am trying to get better about commenting regularly.  So what about you?  How do you decide who to follow?

Dr. Seuss?  Check! Roald Dahl?  Covered!  Louis Sachar? Done! But I know there are books I missed out on reading as a child.  For this week's Tuesday Top Ten <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/01/reenas-top-ten-books-i-wish-id-read-as.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a> ask what are the top 10 books you wish you read when you were a kid<br /><br />1. A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle - Lots of people seem to have read and loved this book.  I own a copy and have since I was a child but I've never actually read it.  I think I missed my window.  It's like E.T.  I never saw the movie and I think I've missed my shot.<br />2. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll - I read this as an adult (fully annotated copy.  It's pretty sweet) but I never read it as a kid and I wish I had.  That was and is my favorite of the Disney animated movies and I wish I could have compared the two when I was younger.<br />3. The Little Prince by Antonie de Saint-Exupery - Another one I read when I was older, in a high school French class, but one I think I would have loved as a little kid. Ah well, c'est la vie.g<br />4. Black Beauty by Anna Sewell - Being a girl I fell strongly into the \"I love horses!!!!!\" stereotype when I was little and I'm surprised I never read this one. I had the movie. And I read some other horse series (Thoroughbred something or other) but never this classic.<br />5. Winnie the Pooh by A. A. Milne - Another case where I was familiar with the Winnie the Pooh TV shows (animated and live action people in fur suits, which is a bit creepy now) but I've never actually read any of the original stories.<br />6. A Series of Unfortunate Events series by Lemony Snicket/Daniel Handler - This isn't so much I missed them when I was a kid as they were published after I was out of this range.  But they look like something  I would have loved when I was little.<br />7. Nancy Drew series created by Edward Stratemeyer - I had a full collection of these when I was little.  Some were my grandmother's, most were my mom's.  And that sat on the shelf in the top of my closet.  I assume they made it in the move, which means these are most likely sitting in a box in my mom's basement.<br /><br />7 this week.  That's no bad.  I'm almost to 10.<br /><br />What books do you wish you'd read as a child?<br /><br />I think I took a combined 6 years of French and that is roughly all I remember.  I think I deserve some sort of medal for forgetting so much.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:17+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:17+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-25T16:13:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e895dde22fdcf000558","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e895dde2223b6000176","title":"Kindle Lending and New Book Acquisition","slug":"kindle-lending-and-new-book-acquisition","url":"/articles/kindle-lending-and-new-book-acquisition","body":"I'm currently reading Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer and it is wonderful.  I'll have a post about the first half of the book at some point this week.  I just need to gather my thoughts.  But in the meantime, here are a couple other random topics.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Kindle.jpg\" />When I started seriously thinking about getting an eReader (versus whining to Boyfriend about how I couldn't decide if I should get one at all) one of the features I liked on the Nook was that you could lend out books.  I don't know how often I'd be able to use that feature but I like having the option.  Plus I will be way less anal when lending out digital copies of books because I don't have  to worry about getting the book back all bent up or something got spilled on it, etc.  The Nook advertised the lending capabilities but the Kindle was quiet about it.  I ended up going with the Kindle anyway but was a little sad to miss out on lending.  And then I heard mummers that the Kindle did have lending abilities or at least they'd be coming soon.  If they were out before I didn't see anything about it, but it's definitely available now.  Thanks to <a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/kindle-lending-birthday-bestsellers-and-helping-kids-learn-to-read/\">The Book Stop</a> who provides me with lots of Kindle updates, she's confirmed not only that you can lend but provides links to explain how you can do this lending and she includes a <a href=\"http://kindlelendingclub.com/\">website</a> where you can borrow books from other people for no cost, and lend your books out risk free.  Exciting times.<br /><br />Even having the Kindle I still find I go for actual books more often than not.  At least I keep buying them.  Yesterday I was meeting up with some friends for lunch. I gave myself plenty of time to get to the restaurant because I needed to take the T, which is always a dangerous proposition. I gave myself 45 minutes to get there. I got there in 15 minutes. It was equally likely it would have take an hour and 15 minutes to get there.  Such is the T. Anyway I had at least 30 minutes to kill (my friends and I are perpetually late) but lucky me the BU Barnes &amp; Nobleg was right there.  I wandered around looking at books and then going \"No, I can't pick up more.  I need to wait until I make it through the books I just bought some.  Wait.\" I talked myself out of a couple books but I did end up getting one: A Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks.  I know, it's nerdy.  But you know what?  I'll be prepared when you're all being eaten.<br /><br />This is really a pretty B&amp;N, especially the upper floors.  They have these little nooks and crannies to explore.<br />I'm going to be eaten too. I'm far too clumsy to get away from something even as ungainly as a zombie.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:17+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:17+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-24T14:36:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e895dde2223b6000177","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Max Brooks","slug":"max-brooks","url":"/articles/tags/max-brooks"},{"value":"kindle","slug":"kindle","url":"/articles/tags/kindle"},{"value":"A Zombie Survival Guide","slug":"a-zombie-survival-guide","url":"/articles/tags/a-zombie-survival-guide"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8a5dde22fdcf000559","title":"Literary Blog Hop: Literary read that I can't stand","slug":"literary-blog-hop-literary-read-that-i-cant-stand","url":"/articles/literary-blog-hop-literary-read-that-i-cant-stand","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LiteraryBlogHop-1.jpg\" />For this week's literary blog hop the people over at <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2011/01/literary-blog-hop-jan-20-23.html\">The Blue Bookcase</a> have come up with a question I enjoy far more than I probably should: Discuss a work of literary merit that you hated when you were made to read it in school or university. Why did you dislike it?<br /><br />I don't necessarily think of myself as a particularly negative person but when it comes to complaints I feel like I have a lot to say.  You'd think, since I work in pseudo-tech support, that I'd get all the complaining out of my system while at work.  But no.  Anyway, onto the literary part of this<br /><br />Early American Lit is my least favorite literary time period.  I thought I had managed to weasel my way out of taking any early American lit classes while at college, but last minute (last semester of my final year) I needed a time period class and SURPRISE, this was the only time period available.  With the exception of the Poe stuff we read I was a fairly unhappy camper but my least favorite thing, read in this class and high school English is The Scarlet Letter by Nathanial Hawthorne. I know it's a great story, lots of symbolism, blah blah blah.  The problem is I can't appreciate it for 2 reasons: the characters annoy me so much and the story is boring.<br /><br />Hawthorne managed to take a story filled with adultery, stifling religious beliefs and lies and yet I had trouble reading it without falling asleep.  I know this isn't the case with all of Hawthorne's writing.  I love some of his short stories, especially <u>Young Goodman Brown</u> and <u>Rappaccini's Daughter</u>.  OK, maybe \"love\" is too strong but I enjoyed both those stories and have read them more than once.  But The Scarlet Letter never really draws me in.  I remember I would constantly stop reading to count how many pages I have left in the chapter, book, etc.  That's never a good sign.<br /><br />gThar be spoilers<br />Then there are the characters.  I just spend my time arguing with them.  I wish I could agree with Hester keeping quiet about Pearl's father's identity.  On the other hand, Dimmesdale is such a coward that I don't really see why protecting him is so necessary.  Maybe if Hawthorne had given Hester a stronger voice I wouldn't be so frustrated with the characters.  Hell, maybe that would help with my other point and the story would be more interesting.  But he didn't and thus, my points stand.<br />Spoilers contained. Carry on<br /><br />What about you?  What literary work can't you stand?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:18+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:18+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-20T17:28:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8a5dde22fdcf00055a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8a5dde2238670002f2","title":"For anyone of a rational disposition, fashion is often nearly impossible to fathom.","slug":"for-anyone-of-a-rational-disposition-fashion-is-often-nearly-impossible-to-fathom","url":"/articles/for-anyone-of-a-rational-disposition-fashion-is-often-nearly-impossible-to-fathom","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/At-Home-e-cover.jpg\" />I just finished Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life and I was not disappointed.  Bryson's history books, At Home, A Short History of Nearly Everything and his Shakespeare biography Shakespeare: The World as Stage are less laugh out loud funny than when he writes his own personal anecdotes, either in his travelogues or memoir, but this is hardly to say that this book was devoid of humor.  It's just more understated.  Even without belly aching humor this is a book I'm sure I'll re-read a few times.  History has never been my favorite subject to read and most of the time when reading historical texts I find my mind wandering. <br /><br />Perhaps because Bryson comes to history from such an amateurs point of view I never feel alienated or bogged down by obscure details.  If anyone else were to write a book that included the history of the modern London sewage system I'm sure I would laugh at the subject and immediately put the book down.  When Bryson does it though I'm intrigued.  He is able to stress the importance of the engineering of this new system of plumbing in a way that I can understand and appreciate.  And of course there's his voice: \"Late in life [Joseph Bazalgette] was knighted, but he never really received the fame he deserved.  Sewer engineers seldom do.\" (location 6213) Bryson appreciates the accomplishments of Bazalgette and others like him and is able to articulate that enthusiasm to a reader like me, who has no natural interest in such topics.<br /><br />In the intro Bryson describes his purpose of the book<br /><blockquote>So I formed the idea to make a journey around it, to wander from room to room and consider how each has featured in the evolution of private life.  The bathroom would be a history of hygiene, the kitchen of cooking, the bedroom of sex and death and sleeping, and so on.  I would write a history of the world without leaving home. (location 107)</blockquote>Most of the time he accomplishes this and you can see how the room he is investigating relates to the history he's sharing.  Sometimes, especially in the final \"Attic\" chapter, he goes off in such a direction that I was never able to make the connection between the story and the room at the top of a house.  But that never bothered me.  I love the short random stories and it doesn't especially bother me if the stories are not directly related, as long as they're interesting.  I have enough ADD that I have no problem jumping between topics.  For those nervous about this, the book is fairly consistent and of course does have the over-arching theme of how home life has changed over time and what lead to the changes.<br /><br />Title quote from location 6427<br /><br />Bryson, Bill.

This week they ask for your top ten most inspirational characters.  As per usual I won't be able to come up with 10 but I still like to play along so here goes<br /><br />1. Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - I expect him to show up on nearly everyone's list.  How could he not?  He's kind, patient, thoughtful and moral.  He is everything I should strive to be, even if I am rarely able to reach his level on any of the points.  Really, I almost feel like I could end the list here.<br /><br />2. Thursday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde -  She's strong and tough, works for the Literary Detectives (LiteraTechs), is intensely loyal and unwaveringly moral.  She doesn't really have Atticus's patience but she makes up for it with humor.  Plus she can kick a lot of ass.<br /><br />3. Lilith from the Lilith's Brood series by Octavia Butler - She has a strong sense of what is right and wrong in very uncertain times.  Like when Earth has been destroyed and your living with a group of aliens that are going to alter the human race in such a way that there will no longer be humans but instead a new species.  The book has a lot of gray areas and Lilith is forced to make tough decisions over and over again.  Her choice was almost never the one I would have made, but it was usually the better one.<br /><br />4. Liesel Meminger, and Hans and Rose Hubermann from The Book Thief by Markus Zusak - I know I could have easily split this one up into 3 and then I'd be closer to my 10 but that feels like cheating.  And I'd rather fail to hit 10 than do something lame like that.  This family may seem broken and hell is broken in a few ways, so much love permeates this group during a time of immense hate.  The love isn't insular but spreads to Max Vanenburg, the Jew the family hides in their basement.  Anytime someone can show so much love and forgiveness in a situation where I doubt I could muster it, I'm moved.<br /><br />Alright that's all I got.  Anything else is starting to feel forced.  So who are your favorite inspirational fictional characters?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:18+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:18+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-18T15:42:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8a5dde2238670002f5","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8b5dde2238670002f6","title":"Reaping the benefits of a book giveaway","slug":"reaping-the-benefits-of-a-book-giveaway","url":"/articles/reaping-the-benefits-of-a-book-giveaway","body":"I got a mystery package the other day.

I was thinking to myself that I should continue to open packages from strangers.  Then I remembered I was the benefactor of someone else's book giveaway. <br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Speak+cover.jpg\" />Back in mid-December, Ben from <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/\">Dead End Follies</a> tweeted that the first person to answer him back would get a free book.

After a single vacation to Seattle I'm ready to move out there, at least for a few years.  I have trouble articulating exactly what it was about the city that I loved, but it was enough to make me want to switch coasts for awhile.<br />2. I started snowboarding when I was 13, after skiing for a couple seasons.  Unfortunately I haven't been back on the slopes in a few years and my snowboard is just sitting around, waiting to be brought back on a mountain.  I should figure out how to get rid of the stickers I put on it when I was in high school, as cool as they are.g<br />3. I own several Nintendo consoles: Regular, Super, 64, Wii, Game Boy Color, DS.  The majority are hand-me-downs from Brother when he got bored with the system.  Except the Wii; that's all mine. Also I'm trying to con a few GameCube games out of the Brother.  Boyfriend also has a PS3.  Lots of entertainment options.<br />4. I love slinkies.  I'm actually playing with one right now.  I think it's a nervous habit.  I have a lot of trouble sitting still.<br />5. I hate driving.  As soon as Boyfriend got his license I have mostly handed that responsibility over to him. This hatred is most likely caused by living in Boston because all of the stereotypes you've heard about Boston drivers are true and then some. <br /><br />I'm going to fail on parts 3 and 4 and here's why: some people like these awards and some don't really want them.  I don't want anyone to feel like they need to accept the award and spread the love so heres how this part works.

It's currently covering Boston with heavy wet snow that made my commute to work a pain in the ass.  I'm fairly certain I was mumbling curses aloud while trudging through it.  Luckily I only saw about 8 other people outside who decided to brave this weather so the number of people who thought me crazy this morning is lower than normal.  As I dripped my way into the front door of the our floor I was greeted with \"Congratulations.  You're the fifth person to show up.\"  There are about 80 people that work in my office and most of them aren't making it in.  Lucky people who have that option. So I'm not in the happiest of spirits this morning. Also, I'm super jealous at Greg over a <a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/2011/01/spreading-some-mid-winter-book-blogger.html\">The New Dork Review</a> right now, since he's avoiding this crappy weather by laying on a beach in Hawaii.  Seems like the perfect answer to this weather.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Boston-Blizzard2.jpg\" />I'm telling you this because since my office moved to a new location and switched to an open concept model, my computer screen is now in a high traffic area so I tend to spend less time on my blog during the day.  But because I'm annoyed I'm here at the office while no one else from my team is showing up, I've decided this is a good enough reason to spend extra time on here today. Yes, I am spiteful like that.<br /><br />Now, I don't actually have a book review to post.  I'm still reading At Home (52%!  I really do love that counter) but I do have some random things to talk about, so here goes:<br /><br />1. I may have fixed, or at least improved, the commenting system I'm using.  I decided awhile back to go with Intense Debate because it was supposed to be easier for non-blogspot people to post comments.  It's given me a lot of trouble and I know at least a few people who the comment box won't even pop up for.  I have managed to get a \"Comment\" link to show up under the posts.  In IE and Chrome it shows up just fine, in Firefox it shows up 3 times, but all 3 of the links work.  Go figure.  Anyway, hopefully that will make commenting less of a hassle.  I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of Intense Debate but not lose all of my comments.  That's been a losing battle so far.<br /><br />2. Ben over at <a href=\"http://www.deadendfollies.com/2011/01/your-birthday-best-seller-list.html\">Dead End Follies</a> has a post about your birthday best seller list. Check out the best sellers from your birthday by going to <a href=\"http://www.biblioz.com/best_sellers.php?a=0&amp;i=43622970\">Biblioz.com</a>. Here's top 10 fiction<br /><br />1. The Aquitaine Progression by Robert Ludlum<br />2. Smart Women by Judy Blume<br />3. Who Killed the Robyns Family created by Bill Adler (I don't know what this is...)<br />4. Pet Semetary by Stephen King<br />5. The Butter Battle Book by Dr. Seuss.  (This one makes me extremely happy)<br />6. Almost Paradise by Susan Isaacs<br />7. Lord of the Dance by Andrew M. Greeley<br />8. The Danger by Dick Francis<br />9. Poland by James A. Michener<br />10. The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco<br /><br />3. I missed yesterday's Tuesday Top Ten, hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2011/01/top-ten-tuesday-bookish-resolutions.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>.  The list asked for top ten bookish resolutions and I had a whole post about how<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2011/happy-2011-reading-challenges-and-new\"> I don't make resolutions</a> and blah blah blah. But while I don't plan on making resolutions for my general betterment, I can think of  couple that I'd like to make in my reading and blogging world.  So they are<br /><br />1. Read The Corrections at some point this year. I bought this at the airport coming back from a friend's wedding because I had run out of books to read.  I liked the little I read but got intimidated by it and have since found plenty of excuses to read other things.  I will not let this book sit on my shelf unread for an entire year.<br />2. Comment on blogs more.  I read a lot of blogs but I'd say at least 90% of the time I don't leave a comment.  I need to work on that.<br />3. Keep stats on the books I read. I really liked the end of year stats list bloggers like Brenna at <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/2010/12/year-in-reading-2010.html\">Literary Musings</a> came up with.  I want to come up with this myself for next year and see what my reading habits look like plotted out.<br />4. Host a giveaway.  When blogger got mad at me and deleted my blog, I made a comment on my Twitter account that if my blog came back I was going to host a giveaway.  I'd like to not make that an empty promise so I will host some sort of giveaway.<br />5. Expand my reading horizons.  This partially goes along with keeping stats on my books, but I know I read a lot of books by white male American authors.  I'd like to branch out a bit while still reading things I think I'll enjoy<br /><br />We'll see if I can stick to these resolutions.<br /><br /> These are my random I-wish-I-had-a-snow-day thoughts.  I will try to make the next post more coherent.<br /><br />Updated: To include blizzard pics.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:19+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:19+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-12T15:45:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8b5dde22fdcf00055c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"birthday best sellers","slug":"birthday-best-sellers","url":"/articles/tags/birthday-best-sellers"},{"value":"intense debate","slug":"intense-debate","url":"/articles/tags/intense-debate"},{"value":"snow","slug":"snow","url":"/articles/tags/snow"},{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8c5dde2223b6000178","title":"It is remarkable to think that people thought of striped fabrics before they thought of doors and windows","slug":"it-is-remarkable-to-think-that-people-thought-of-striped-fabrics-before-they-thought-of-doors-and-windows","url":"/articles/it-is-remarkable-to-think-that-people-thought-of-striped-fabrics-before-they-thought-of-doors-and-windows","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Kindle.jpg\" />When I first started considering eReaders I thought it would help on my daily commute. At the time I was spending about an hour a day on the subway, plus time waiting for the T to show up and I lived off the Green line, so this could account for a lot of time.  This gave me some great reading time but could be a hassle if the book was especially large, such as when I was reading the behemoth <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/as-everybody-knows-no-one-with-red-hair\">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a>.  Holding a 6 pound book in my hand while trying to balance on the T was never fun and I would avoid hardback books because I knew I didn't want to have to carry it.<br /><br />Now I have a Kindle, but in the funny way the world works, I no longer ride the subway for my commute.  I've lost a solid hour of reading time and I don't have the same need for an eReader.  Of course. <br /><br />Even though my initial reason for wanting the Kindle is gone, I'm still enjoying reading on it.  It is lightweight enough that holding it in one hand, even in the cover I got, is no problem.  I love that it's easy for me to take notes and highlight passages.  I hate marking up an actual book, so if I happen to see a quote I like I just have to hope I remember what it is.  That hardly ever works out for me.  It has a little counter at the bottom of the page to show you how far through the book you are, which I'm enjoying more than I would have assumed.  Buying books is slightly too easy and I'll have to watch myself.  I still plan on reading actual books so I won't be making a full electronic leap but I'm happy with what I have so far.  And with that, onto the book<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/At-Home-e-cover.jpg\" />I'm reading Bill Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life and I'm currently 38% of the way through. (I told you I love that little counter.) I have been looking forward to this book since about last May, when I first heard about it and that excitement increased when I saw him speak at the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/boston-book-festival-full-frontal\">Boston Book Festival</a>.  Originally I was waiting for the book to come out in paperback but my Kindle has given me the perfect excuse to quit being patient and just get the book now.  I am loving it.  I've said on far too many occasions that I could read about paint drying if Bryson was writing about it and this book practically does that.  Bryson wanders through his English home and gives a history of the house as it has come to be, at least in England and America.  This book isn't quite as laugh-out-loud funny as his travelogues but the humor is still there.  This is much closer in style to his science book A Short History of Nearly Everything.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/At+Home+cover.jpg\" />Because my favorite part of Bryson is his voice, here are some quotes I highlighted<br /><br />His summary as to the etymology of the word \"cabinet\"<br /><blockquote>This explains why this one word now describes both the most intimate and exalted group of advisers in government and the shelved recess in the bathroom where we keep Ex-Lax and the like. (location 1049)</blockquote> Explaining how demanding people were on their servants<br /><blockquote>It wasn't just a question of doing the work, but often of doing it to the kind of exacting standards that generally occur only to people who don't have to do the work themselves. (location 1544)</blockquote>The cheapness of the Duke of Marlborough.  He can probably also be described by the quote above<br /><blockquote>The duke was so cheap that he refused to dot his i's when he wrote, to save on ink.

I generally have time during the day to get a post in but we've had some big changes at work and finding time to even make it through my blog roll.  Silly work, getting all kinds of in the way of my important business.<br /><br />This week's literary blog hop question, host by <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2011/01/literary-blog-hop-jan-6-9.html\">The Blue Bookcase</a>, is \"How did you find your way to reading literary fiction and nonfiction?\"<br /><br />I never had a defining moment that lead me literary fiction.  My mom has always been a voracious reader but never of the literary type.  She always had a book in hand but her books were for escape.  Except David Copperfield; she would quote the opening to that.  There were always books all over the house and my mom encouraged reading of any type.  My dad on the other hand mostly reads newspapers or magazines but studied literature in college.  When he does read, he reads quality and whenever he recommends a book I make sure to check it out.  I'm rarely disappointed.  I ended up somewhere between the the quality/quantity numbers of my parents.  But in the end I read what I read because that's what I like.  I don't want to read something pointless and formulaic.  I don't want to waste my time.  My literature classes through high school and college gave me the insight and the confidence to know that while reading them isn't going to be easy, it's worth it. <br /><br />What got you into good literature?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:20+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:20+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-07T01:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8c5dde226419000634","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8c5dde22fdcf00055d","title":"I prefer to do my walks of shame in the evening, when it's not so bright","slug":"i-prefer-to-do-my-walks-of-shame-in-the-evening-when-its-not-so-bright","url":"/articles/i-prefer-to-do-my-walks-of-shame-in-the-evening-when-its-not-so-bright","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/My+Horizontal+Life+cover.jpg\" />I'm reading My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands by Chelsea Handler for my \"book club\".  It's not really a book club, in that 90% of the time we aren't discussing the book but it is a good excuse to get together with friends, drink wine and eat food.  And it does give me the excuse to break free of my normal book selections and go for something I wouldn't normally pick up.  Like this month's book.<br /><br />I'm not against Chelsea Handler but I can't actually remember seeing any of her stand up.  I know she has a talk show on some channel.  I'm assuming E!  But while I can't recall ever seeing any of Handler's work I can't say this is entirely out of my comfort zone.  I wouldn't have picked this book up on my own but comedic short essays is something I'm familiar with.  I figured it would be something along the line of <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/as-most-new-yorkers-have-done-i-have\">Sloane Crosley's</a> <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/one-day-you-turn-around-and-social\">I Was Told There Would Be Cake</a>.  Handler's stories are more connected.  They're all about her one-night stands, her drinking and her lies (which are probably my favorite part).  But they do have the similarity of being short, humorous, stand alone pieces, several of which are kind of boring.  I was hoping to laugh more; she's a comedienne after all.  It has its moments but so much of it feels like she's trying too hard.  Maybe if I was already familiar with her voice from her stand-up I would be able to hear her tone in the reading and get something more out of it.  But really, I should get her tone from her writing.<br /><br />She hits her stride about 10 stories in, which is a little more than halfway through the book.  The stories from her early life don't have the easy tone she manages in the later stories.  I never actually found myself laughing out loud while reading these but I was smirking silently during many points in the second half of the book.  But I know my sense of humor isn't the same as everyone's.  It seems to be pretty far from what a lot of people find funny.  A few of the girls from book club have read this book before or other Handler books and said they were constantly laughing out loud while reading them, so this is definitely someone's martini (given the book, I thought this was more appropriate than \"cup of tea\") but it isn't really for me.  \"Don't Believe A Word I Say\" and \"Out of the Closet\" are my favorites.  They're filled with more lying than the other stories and her lies are hilarious because they make no sense.  I want the confidence to tell people I'm an Olympic bound synchronized swimmer that can hold her breath for 6 minutes and to completely not care that it makes no sense and I can't back it up in the slightest.<br /><br />When Handler goes for shock value she misses the mark.  It feels like she's trying so hard to be edgy that she loses the humor.  She did make me want to watch clips of Louis CK (check out his piece on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY\">being white</a>) so that's something.<br /><br />Title quote from page 77<br /><br />Handler, Chelsea.

Obviously the book changed itself partway through due to my whims.  That's the sort of power I wield.  In my head.<br /><br />Initially I had trouble focusing on the book.  I took any excuse to stop reading it.  Then it was like a switch was flipped and suddenly I couldn't put the book down.  It was still wordy at times, but the wordiness seemed to serve the story or serve the characters and not be an exercise in meeting some page length minimum.  Blue continues to cite reference after reference, from encyclopedias to her Dad's lecture notes, but these are less clawing, more pertinent to the story.  From the sheer volume you know Blue has essentially a photographic memory, able to quote every book she's come across, but now you learn more from the actual citations.<br /><br />The book is a coming of age first and foremost with a murder mystery/conspiracy theory thrown in.  After Part One, the book found its balance between these two genres, with the language, with Blue's voice.  The story goes in plenty of directions but it is to the benefit of the story instead of sounding like the author has ADD and was unable to decide what to do next.  Everything fits together and makes you want to go back and reread parts of it as the story progresses, not because of confusion but because there is a lot to take in and I wanted to see how pages I'd already read change with the new information garnered.<br /><br />There is humor, especially in Blue's father's various bon mots, lectures, discussions, anytime he opens his mouth.  He's pretentious and snobby but he's amusing and because of that he is a character you want to watch.  At one point he is describing the ambiguous ending of a movie<br /><blockquote>\"L'Avventura,\" Dad said, \"has the sort of ellipsis ending most American audiences would rather undergo a root canal than be left with, not only because they loathe anything left to the imagination - we're talking about a country that invented spandex - but also because they are confident, self-assured nation...the idea that none of us can truly know anything at all - not the lives of our friends or family, not even ourselves - is a thought they'd rather be shot in the arm with their own semi-automatic rifle than face head on.\" (411)</blockquote>The book has it's own ambiguous ending though perhaps Pessel couldn't leave it totally uncertain (she is American) and the book ends with a Final Exam of True/False, Multiple Choice and Essay question that shed a little more light on the narrative. <br /><br />This is Pessl's first novel and I'm intrigued enough to check out what else she comes up with.  Special Topics may also be made into a movie at some point, which I'd be interested in checking out.  Mirimax optioned the screen rights at some point in '07 (<a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957117?refCatId=13\">according to Variety</a>) but who knows when, if ever, it will make it to the screen.<br /><br />Title quote from page 261<br /><br />Special Topics in Calamity Physics.

How sad.  I had a great time seeing family, meeting up with friends and doing nothing more strenuous than reading or playing on my computer.  It was wonderful and getting back into the work swing of things is going to be difficult but I'm sure I'll manage through it.<br /><br />This is usually the time of year for New Years resolutions.  The normal \"I'll exercise more/learn a new language/eat better/make myself a better person/blah blah blah\" promises that are usually broken after a month. As is probably clear, I'm cynical towards the tradition and don't usually make my own resolutions.  I figure if I'm going to do one of these self-bettering things I shouldn't be waiting for a new year and I don't need to make a grand gesture of it; I should just do it.  I guess that's my way of rationalizing it anyway.  I also know that whenever I feel like I'm being made to do something <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/1001-books-you-must-readbut-i-probably\">I'll do the opposite</a>.  I can be annoyingly stubborn like that.  Likewise I've had the same reaction to reading challenges.  There are so many and some of them look fun but I have this feeling if I were to sign up for one I'd never actually read the books, even if they were books I wanted to read anyway, because I was being told I had to read them. <br /><br />I know lots of people take part in these reading challenges, so can someone tell me why you sign up for a challenge?  Are there certain challenges you always sign up for or are there other types you'd never sign up for?  Are there challenges you thought you'd hate and in the end were really glad you participated in?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:21+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:21+00:00","published_at":"2011-01-01T18:02:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8d5dde22fdcf000560","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Book Haul","slug":"book-haul","url":"/articles/tags/book-haul"},{"value":"Happy New Year","slug":"happy-new-year","url":"/articles/tags/happy-new-year"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8d5dde226419000635","title":"Dad always said a person must have a magnificent reason for writing out his or her Life Story and expecting anyone to read it","slug":"dad-always-said-a-person-must-have-a-magnificent-reason-for-writing-out-his-or-her-life-story-and-expecting-anyone-to-read-it","url":"/articles/dad-always-said-a-person-must-have-a-magnificent-reason-for-writing-out-his-or-her-life-story-and-expecting-anyone-to-read-it","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Special+Topics+cover.jpg\" />My friend sent me Special Topics in Calamity Physics by Marisha Pessl in a package containing Vonnegut's Galapagos and Mieville's The City and The City.  Galapagos was my copy he was returning and The City and The City was a mutual friend's copy that I'd wanted to read, and Special Topics was a book my friend thought I should check out.  I don't know that I would have picked it up on my own (it's hardback which is almost enough for me to have passed it by) but I'm always glad to take a recommendation from a trusted friend. <br /><br />I'm only about a quarter of the way through the book so far and I'm hoping the story picks up soon.  According to the back cover and the intro, the story is a murder mystery.  The main character, Blue, finds Hannah dead and must make sense of what's happened.  After setting this up in a few sentences, the story jumps back in time to give you an introduction to Blue and her father, a travelling university professor and kind of a pretentious dick.  OK, that's my take on him and I constantly want someone to spill something staining on his Tweed jacket.  It hasn't happened yet, but I have my hopes.  I'm ambivalent towards Blue at the moment.  She's extremely intelligent due to the constant  assignments and exercises her father has been giving her for as far back as she details.  For reasons unknown to her (and to the reader because the book is told from Blue's point of view) the high society Blueblood group reluctantly brings her into the gilded circle, lead by the soon-to-be-dead Film teacher Hannah. <br /><br />The chapters are split into a syllabus of Required Reading titles that subtly relate to the chapters.  You need to be familiar with the required readings in order to see all of the parallels and, to me, the most obvious is the Pygmalion chapter, where Blue gets a mini-makeover courtesy of Jade and her mother's black American Express.  I'm glad this isn't more overt or I think this style would seem gimmicky and would take away from the story.g  One thing that is getting slightly annoying is the constant citations for ever reference she makes.  I suppose in a way it shows you how far into academia Blue is but I've found myself skipping over these.  Point made, move on.<br /><br />I'm undecided on the book so far.  I'm enjoying it but I haven't been pulled into the story yet.  It's been easy for me to put the book down.  I'm hoping the story moves forward soon.  The writing is interesting, the characters are intriguing but now I need the story to continue on.  I do have high hopes though.

So I was excited to see the book Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip by Nevin Martell sitting on the coffee table one day.  Boyfriend's friend had recently read it and lent it to him, knowing he was also a fan. So I put down the book I had been reading so I could make sure I finished this book before Friend started demanding it back.  The book reminded me why I love Calvin and Hobbes but reading the comic strip as self would have done as much.<br /><br />Martell has a tall order he's trying to fill: get an interview with Watterson, the Salinger of the cartoonist world. Unfortunately though unsurprisingly, he never gets this interview and instead writes the book using \"Plan B - otherwise known as the Morbidly Realistic Plan...[writing] the book as if Watterson were dead,\" (14).  He interviews colleagues and friends of Watterson but never really uncovers new material.  The majority of at least 3 chapters seemed to be him quoting The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary book and an interview in Honk!!.  The anniversary book is my favorite C&amp;H collection, precisely because it includes insights written by Watterson, so Martell didn't really provide any new information about the reclusive cartoonist, and as a result I spent a large portion of the book wishing I was reading that book because then I'd have the comics to read.<br /><br />I think the book would have benefited from a different viewpoint.  Instead of being written as if Watterson was dead I would have much preferred to read his journey as he tried to get an interview.  The information was there but structured in such a way that it actually took away from Watterson's story.  The book almost makes me want to pick up The Complete Calvin and Hobbes which I've considered on a few occasions but I always put back down because it's so expensive and so large.  <br /><br />If you've read all you can on C&amp;H and still want to read more, you should check out this book.  I recommend borrowing it though.  If you like C&amp;H and want to learn more about the series and Watterson, read The Tenth Anniversary book instead.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/This+is+you+C%2526H2.jpg\" />On a separate but related note, one of the gifts I got for Christmas was a framed copy of a Calvin and Hobbes strip.  I mentioned a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/how-do-i-choose\">panel out of the strip once before</a> because the argument Calvin and Hobbes have is pretty much what every argument Boyfriend and I have devolves into.  And as I've mentioned, I'm absolutely Calvin in this relationship.  I wish I was Hobbes but it's just not the case.<br /><br />The title quote isn't a direct line from the book, though I do vaguely remember it being mentioned.  It's the last lines of the comic strip that ran on December 31, 1995.  Boyfriend actually has this strip from his local paper hanging in his childhood bedroom<br /><br />Martell, Nevin.

It's amazing how quickly that thing can spiral out of control.  I've been travelling aroundg to make it to all of the family Christmases.  Thus far we've done Christmas #1 with my family.  Lots of good food, family I don't see nearly enough and, of course, gifts.  Because I'm materialistic like that.  I got that <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-books-i-want-for-xmas\">Kindle I mentioned in my last post</a>, so I'm excited to see how reading goes on it.  I'm thinking of getting the Bill Bryson <em>At Home</em> book on it, since I was going to wait for it to come out in paperback but I'm incredibly impatient.  I got another Shakespeare biography, <em>Soul of the Ages</em> by Jonathan Bate, because I only have 4 of them and that's clearly not enough.  I also managed to nab seasons 1-3 of <em>Mad Men</em> and Sims3 plus a couple expansion packs so I'm set with entertainment for awhile. <br /><br />Tomorrow will be Christmas with the Boyfriend's familia, which means more good food (and most likely a mix of Chinese and Puerto Rican food, which is interesting and delicious) and good people to hang out with.  I'm thinking the next few days will be as busy as the last couple have been, but next week I should have time for reading and blogging, which I know you're just holding you breath waiting for.  <br /><br />Again, I wish everyone seasons greetings, happy holidays, etc etc.  <br /><br />Any potential thieves know that I own nothing of value, unless you think you can make some money off of broken Ikea furniture.

Sticking with the holiday season, this week's question is what are the top 10 books I want for Christmas.<br /><br />I don't usually ask for books for Christmas.  I might ask for a gift card to buy my own books but I do a lot of my book purchasing based on whatever I feel like at the moment, so I can never really give people a list of things I want. I prefer this method to having people buy me books.  Except my Dad.  <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/fenway-park-offers-as-do-most-boston\">He gets a pass</a> because he seems to know what books I'll like before I consider them.<br /><br />I started this thinking I might actually be able to think up 10 books I want but I'm drawing a blank so we'll see how far I make it.<br /><br /><ol><li>Shades of Grey by Jasper Fforde.  I love Fforde's series and I can't wait for a new world of his creation.  The Next series and the Nursery Crime series are both wonderful.  Actually, I want Santa or whomever to wait to give me this until it's in paperback.  That's the reason I haven't picked it up for myself just yet.  Maybe it could be a signed copy.  That's be pretty sweet.</li><li>At Home by Bill Bryson. I've been waiting for this one to come out in paperback as well.  I love Bryson and look forward to reading whatever he happens to write.  </li><li>Mother Tongue by Bill Bryson. While on the topic of Bryson, I used to have this book and during one of my many moves it got lost or lent out to someone or something that just removed it from my possession.  I'd like it back or a new copy.</li><li>Anything by Christopher Moore I don't already have.  That's an extensive list.  Maybe I should start with Bloodsucking Fiends, seeing as I've read You Suck: A Love Story already, not realizing it was a sequel.  Actually I don't know where my copy of You Suck went, so I'd like that as well.</li><li>Some more Vonnegut.  It's been awhile since I've read his work and I should probably pick up some more of his stuff.  Any suggestionsg?</li><li>Kindle. I know this isn't a book but I still want it.  And I actually know I'm getting it, much to the chagrin of my mom who wishes it was a secret.  But I kept going back and forth between the Kindle and the Color Nook so she eventually told me she got it.  Whoops.  I annoyed her into telling me.  It's like I haven't aged at all.</li></ol>I am such a failure at these top 10 lists.  I'd just rather write out the things I think fit the topic rather than pad it out with other stuff.  What's on your want list? <br /><br />I've read Slaughterhouse-Five; Breakfast of Champions; God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Galapagos; Sirens of Titan.  I feel like I'm missing one but since I can't think of it I guess it'd be fine if I read it again. <br />Update: Paolo remembered the missing book, because he knows my bookshelf better than I do apparently. I've also read Cat's Cradle.

I have a nice copy of the book with the full illustrations I got years and years ago and I'm sure it's somewhere safe.  I just don't know where that safe place is.  Instead I am reading it on my iPod.  Awhile back, when I was first looking into eReaders, I downloaded the Kindle and iBooks apps, along with 1 free book each, to see what I thought of them.  A Christmas Carol happened to be my Kindle buy so this worked out nicely.  And reading on my iPod isn't as bad as I assumed it would be.  The screen is small but it doesn't bother me too much while I'm actually reading.  I'll still take a real book over reading on this screen though.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/190528the-muppet-christmas-carol-posters.jpg\" /> My favorite adaptation. I'm not going to review the book because what am I going to say that hasn't been said a million times far more eloquently than I could put it.  I won't bother describing the plot because even if you've never read the book you've seen one of the thousands of adaptations of it I'm sure.  Perhaps if you live in a mud hut you've managed to escape all of them, but then again you're most likely lacking internet as well, which means you aren't reading this.  Instead I'll talk about the humor of the story, which I think a lot of the adaptations ignore.  They might be funny in a different way, but I think most miss the humor of the original.  Except for A Muppet Christmas Carol which uses a lot of direct quotes from the story PLUS singing Muppets! Which is why it's my favorite Christmas movie.<br /><br />What surprised me the first time I really read and paid attention to A Christmas Carol was how funny it is.  The first few pages are my favorite of the book.  Sure it's mostly Dickens going off on a tangent about door-nails and coffin-nails but I love it.  For those unfamiliar with the details of this opening, here they are:<br /><blockquote>\"Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail.  I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade.  But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for.\" </blockquote> I probably find this so funny because I could see myself musing on a topic like this and then losing track of what I was originally talking about while I was on my coffin vs door nail argument.  And a coffin nail does make way more sense as the most dead piece of iron.  What's so dead about a door?  Is it more dead than a window?  What if it's a door to a morgue?  Still has lots of live people going through it while the coffin is just full of dead people.  And I'll get off my tangent now.<br /><br />I like the early parts of the book the best because it's when Scrooge is the nastiest and the most fun to watch.  Sure I want him to be saved and become nice but he's fun to watch when he's a crotchety old man and I love him talking with Marley.  When confronted with the ghost he tells him that he's just a figment of indigestion and if he wanted to he could swallow a toothpick and then have a legion of goblins. Scrooge makes puns in a situation where I would have cowered under the covers.  <br /><br />So those are my admittedly not-very-deep reasons for liking this book so much.  For those that have read it or are at least familiar with the adaptations, why do you like or hate this story?<br /><br />The title is at least in relation to the quote I used earlier.  I'm not exactly sure how to get page numbers off this Kindle app but it lists the location as 9-12.  If that means anything to you, super.  It doesn't to me.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:23+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:23+00:00","published_at":"2010-12-17T16:00:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e8f5dde22fdcf000562","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Charles Dickens","slug":"charles-dickens","url":"/articles/tags/charles-dickens"},{"value":"A Christmas Carol","slug":"a-christmas-carol","url":"/articles/tags/a-christmas-carol"}]}]},{"id":"53224e8f5dde2238670002fe","title":"And then Bond fought a giant squid","slug":"and-then-bond-fought-a-giant-squid","url":"/articles/and-then-bond-fought-a-giant-squid","body":"I know when I was reading this I found lots of ridiculous quotes but I didn't mark them down and I can't find them right now.

Also I guess this kind of includes spoilers but the title does as well and you've probably already read that.  Sorry.  Don't worry, it wasn't a huge surprise.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/squidfight_dark.jpg\" /> This would have been <br />awesome too. Dr. No by Ian Fleming was a fun book and if you're a big fan of the movies I'm sure you would have enjoyed this more than I did.  For me it was entertaining.  At least a third of the entertainment came from the fact that it shows it's age and I enjoyed reading my friend passages that I would not feel comfortable reading to the general public.g The rest of it is the same sort of entertainment you'd expect from a Bond film.  A Bond film pre-Daniel Craig, where it's cheesier and has the evil-maniacal super-villain with a secret lair built into the side of a mountain.  Also a pain obstacle course that ends in giant squid fight!  I mean all of this as a compliment.  It's not a deep book with complex characters or subtle themes but really, if you're reading Bond for those things you're doing it wrong.<br /><br />I would like to mention the part that I seem to keep dwelling on in the book and that goes along with the I-would-be-uncomfortable-reading-this-aloud-in-public, though apparently not discussing it publicly here:  Chigroes, which were a regular feature throughout the novel.  I want to explain why I've brought them up multiple times and not just because I thought they were horribly racially insensitive.  It's also because I can't think of too many other races/nationalities that you can smoosh the 2 together to create a descriptor for the person.  What I mean is Boyfriend is Puerto Rican and Chinese and refers to himself as China Rican.  (Or Chinarican.  I should ask him to spell it out for me.)  I haven't heard this happen with different nationalities but if you can think of examples, or want to make some up, please throw them out there.  So I guess this was just my \"I swear I'm not racist and just find this funny.  I'm sure that makes me kind of a bad person but whatever\" excuse.<br /><br />I'm not saying Fleming was a racist (probably sexist in a Don Draper kind of way) but that it was just the time.  It just makes it awkwardly funny now.  To me anyway.<br /><br />Blogger spell check does not recognize Puerto Rican as a set of words.  If I go with their first spell check options I get Puerile Rica.  Yup, that's what I was going for.  Thanks for the help. <br /><br />The classic sensibilities of a Chinese man mixed with dynamic flair of a Puerto Rican.

And I know you're not supposed to read all 1001 books in a year but it still seems like a hefty challenge nonetheless.  I'm not going to take part in the actual challenge because anytime I'm told to do anything (even if I'm the one doing the telling) I tend to do the opposite.  So I think if I said I would do this challenge I would not read any books and suddenly become a big Jersey Shore fan and no one wants that. (Jersey Shore is the opposite of reading books right?)

First of all I'd like to say I'm very very happy my blog is back and I'm going to start backing up all of my posts in case Blogger decides to go haywire again.  For those that follow me on Twitter, sorry you had to see all of my annoying blog complaining.  For those that don't follow me on Twitter (or those that ignored my annoying Tweets, which is probably what I would have done) here's what happened:<br /><br />Blogger has some algorithm to find spam blogs.  If it finds a spam blog it's supposed to let you know that it thinks your blog is spam and then you have to go through an appeals process to show that you aren't spam.  Sometimes it marks obviously non-spam blogs as spam but it's trying.  What happened was sometime on 12/9 something went wonky (technical term) and Blogger accidentally deleted a whole bunch of blogs without any sort of warning or appeals process.  On the Blogger forum thread I was on there were about 100+ blogs by the end that had been deleted without warning.  Awesome right?  I woke up Saturday morning and went to sign into my blog and Blogger was like \"What blog?  You don't have a blog?  Would you like to start a new blog since you've never had a blog before.\"  Google searches found my blog, but clicking on it just brought up a page saying \"Oh no, you're mistaken.  There's no one by that name here.\"<br /><br />After some searching around I found the forum post about this issue, added my name to the list of other deleted blogs and then compulsively refreshed to see if anything had been resolved.  2 days later and question is suddenly marked as answered.  So I check my blog and here it is!  This has also shown me that I'm apparently a wee bit of a blogging addict and should probably do something about that but at the moment all I'm going to do is a happy dance.<br /><br />AND, during some of my non-blogging delirium time, I decided I'd try to host one of those giveaway things to celebrate my fact that my blog did come back.  I'll probably do it right after the holidays because I need to figure out how to run this thang, but keep an eye out for that. <br /><br />I'll have a real post soon but I think I like doing TwitterBookReviews as well so I'll probably keep that up on top of an actual review.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:24+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:24+00:00","published_at":"2010-12-13T18:39:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e905dde22641900063a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224e905dde22fdcf000563","title":"Literary Pet Peeves","slug":"literary-pet-peeves","url":"/articles/literary-pet-peeves","body":"Another Thursday, another literary blog hop hosted by <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2010/12/literary-blog-hop-dec-9-12.html\">The Blue Bookcase</a>.  This week's question is: what is one of your literary pet peeves?<br /><br />I've glanced at a couple people's entries so far and there are some good examples of things that really grind my gears (thanks Family Guy!) but at the moment I have a literary pet peeve I'm trying to work through: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect\">eye dialect</a>.  I wrote about this recently because I'm never one to turn down a chance to complain, so apologies if you don't want to hear it again.  You could instead listen to this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTFh8LCBZeQ\">men's a capella group doing a cover of Bad Romance</a>.<br /><br />For those that don't follow ever post I put out there (and why not??) I hate when author's use difficult-to-follow eye dialect.  I understand it can add flavor to the text and give you an idea how the author thinks the characters sound.  But I can never figure out what's being said unless I read it out loud.  And there are a couple problems with that.<br /><br />1) I'm usually in public when I read and people don't seem to appreciate someone reading aloud in a ridiculous accent.<br />2) The most recent examples I've come across are in Dr. No by Ian Fleming and I feel really racist reading those parts out loud, even when I'm home.<br /><br />Here is an example of the eye dialect I just had to get through:<br /><blockquote>'Him have plenty watchmen. An' guns - machine guns.  An' a radar.  An' a  spottin' plane.  Frens o' mine have landed dere and him never been sen  again. Dat Chinee keep him island plenty private.  Tell dat trut',  cap'n', Quarrel as apologetic 'dat Crab Key care me plenty.'</blockquote>Or if you'd prefer an example from George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. At least he realized how difficult it would be to read (and probably sucked to write it) so he dropped it after you got the point.<br /><blockquote>Ow, eez ye-ooa san, is e? Wal, fewd dan y' de-ooty bawmz a mather  should, eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel's flahrzn than ran awy  atbaht pyin.

I started using it probably sometime over the summer when I needed to learn more about it for work.  My co-worker and I set up our own personal accounts and I've been hooked since.  I can't really explain the appeal but I'm on the thing all the time so it's got its hooks in me. <br /><br />Why am I bothering to tell you about my Twitter account?  Because slowly people from the book blogging universe found me over there.  Then I started tweeting my blog entries because someone recommended it as a good way to share your blog.  Originally I was keeping the 2 separate because my Twitter account isn't really about books so much as it's about whatever is on my mind at that moment.  But now the two worlds have collided so I figured it was time to add a Twitter button onto my blog.  It's over there on the left.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/twitterfollow.jpg\" /> I love that the bird looks terrified. <br />I follow a few different book bloggers and it was fortuitous that the day I decide I should just suck it up and add a button is also the day Brenna from <a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musings</a> asked on Twitter about any good follow buttons.  And Greg from <a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/\">The New Dork Review</a> recommended a site that looked pretty good, so I piggy-backed on that advice and here we are now.<br /><br />So if you want to follow me, the button is now up!

I usually do the top 10 if either it's something I've thought about before or if it's something I can think of some answers to right off the bat.  But like the worst character names, the topic just made me go \"meh,\" so I didn't bother. But I am back this week for the topic: Favorite Places to Read.  As usual we'll see if I can make it to 10.  Also as usual (though I don't always state it) the answers are in the order I thought of them, not in any \"most to least\" favorite order.  I usually read curled up on the couch or maybe in bed but here are my favorite places to read<br /><br /><ol><li>Central Park - At least when the weather is nice.  I love Central Park and it is probably one of my favorite places to be overall.  Having a book only makes it better.  I usually read over by the baseball fields, since I'm usually with Boyfriend and we're either watching some team play or he and his friends are playing.</li><li>The Beach - For the most part any beach will do, so long as it has nice sand, it's not too windy, it's warm and I have an umbrella.  I am far to pale to actually sit out in the sun so the umbrella is key.</li><li>My friend's giant pink chair - I wish I had a picture of this thing.  It was a chair you could comfortably fit 2 (very close) people in.  It was squishy and soft and the best place to curl up. </li><li>Boston Public Gardens - If you've seen Good Will Hunting the Public Gardens are where Robin Williams and Matt Damon go to sit on a bench and talk, out by the swan boats.  It has more shade (so pale) and more benches than the Commons has and is generally a more relaxing place.</li><li>The T - I know, I know, I hate the T so how is this one of my favorite reading spots? Hear me out: if I have to take a long subway ride AND I get a seat (preferably with no one on either side of me) I can get a lot of quality reading done because I'm so focused on blocking everything out that I can get fully absorbed into the book.  I haven't had this experience in awhile and I miss it.</li></ol>Alright, so I only made it to 5.  I'm sure there are more great places to read I'm not thinking of.  So where are your favorite places to read?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:25+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:25+00:00","published_at":"2010-12-07T14:20:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e915dde22641900063c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e915dde2223b600017e","title":"Morning 007","slug":"morning-007","url":"/articles/morning-007","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Hank+Scorpio.jpg\" /> Normal day at the office. I decided to give some Ian Fleming a go, mostly because of my brother, for 2 reasons.  He's a James Bond fan and I'm pretty sure his last job was for a James Bond-esque villain.  Maybe not Dr. No but at least someone like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Scorpio#Season_8\">Hank Scorpio</a> (who by the way is one of my favorite one-time Simpsons characters).  He described some of the projects he was working on and they all seemed to involve lasers pointed at a person, usually aimed at the jugular or eyeball.  Sure, he claims it was part of some elaborate lie detector test that involves measuring heart rate or eye movements, but I assume it's a lie detector that involves making the person tell the truth or you shoot them with lasers.  He also recently described part of his office as the \"command center\" and this is apparently not just some nerdy nickname but the actual name of the place.  I've advised him to quit immediately if they ask him to start wearing a jumpsuit to work.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Dr.-No-cover.jpg\" />I haven't see the movie Dr. No, so other than the usual Bond hijinks I wasn't too sure what I was in for.  My initial thoughts are this book has not aged all that well.  The book was written in '58 and displays the racial sensitivities you would expect of a book from this time.  One of the characters, Quarrel, is described as \"West Indian\" and is given the dialect to match.  I hate when authors do this because it makes it that much more difficult to read unless I'm reading it out loud, which is generally discouraged when in public.  Here's a bit of his speech describing Dr. No:<br /><blockquote>\"'Him have plenty watchmen. An' guns - machine guns.  An' a radar.  An' a spottin' plane.  Frens o' mine have landed dere and him never been sen again. Dat Chinee keep him island plenty private.  Tell dat trut', cap'n', Quarrel as apologetic 'dat Crab Key care me plenty.'\" (40)</blockquote>So that's been fun to wade through so far. There are also some Chinese-Africans called Chigroes (racial sensitivity!)<br /><br />Even though I haven't seen Dr. No, I can't help but already have a vision of what Bond is like.  Thus far he's somewhere between Connery and Craig, although I understand that Bond as Fleming has written him is even more amoral than the version Craig plays.  So far M fits this description.  In the first few pages he's listing off organs that his agents can go without, including: \"one of his two lungs\" and \"two of his four or five quarts of blood,\" (13).  Considering this is Bond's boss, no wonder he's a bad ass.  There's also a picture of Fleming on the inside cover and I now picture him as M.  He has this expression on his face that says \"I'm tired of your bullshit and if you keep this up, I'm putting this cigarette out in your eye.\"  M is so well defined in a few pages, I'm hoping Bond gets fleshed out more.  Hopefully once Quarrel has wandered off so I don't need to read his lines anymore.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes.  If anyone has read any of the Bond books, let me know which you liked better: the book or the movies.  I know in general the books are better but so far this has the potential to show me that I like the film version of Bond.<br /><br />Fleming, Ian.

I gave you a little bit of false hope that this might be something other than that, but nope!  I love Bryson's voice in his writing and I love Italy so I think the best thing to do is to share my favorite quotes from the Italy chapters.  These are the quotes that made me laugh, reminded me of Italy or, most often, a little of both.<br /><br />I feel I should, at least briefly, explain my Italian infatuation.  First, despite the red hair, I am part-Italian.  I'm originally from Northern New Jersey (think Sopranos locales and please ignore Jersey Shore) so I grew up assuming everyone was at least a little Italian.  And because my grandmother is very proud that she is Italian and my other non-Italian relatives didn't really seem to care too much about their background, I most identify with this portion of my heritage.  Second, I studied in Italy for a semester in college.  My friend and I picked Italy because when I mentioned other countries to my grandma she got nervous (this is her normal state-of-mind).  When I mentioned we might go to Italy she lit up because see, that's not a foreign country, that's \"home,\" so it's not scary to her.  And off we go...<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/perugia-big.jpg\" /><br />\"The Italians appear to have devised a way of having sex without taking their clothes off, and they were going at it hammer and tongs up there.  I had an ice cream and watched to see how many of the lovers tumbled over the edge to be dashed on the rocks below, but none did, thank goodness.  They must wear suction cups on their back.\" (133)<br /><br />\"I love the way Italians park.  You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people...Romans park their cars the way I would park if I had just spilled a beaker of hydrochloric acid on my lap.\" (134)<br /><br />\"Italians are entirely without any commitment to order.  They live their lives in a kind of pandemonium, which I find very attractive.  They don't line up, they don't pay their taxes, they don't turn up for appointments on time, they don't undertake any sort of labor without a small bribe, they don't believe in rules at all.\" (135)<br /><br />\"[Italians] are too busy expending their considerable energies on the pleasurable minutiae of daily life - on children, on good food, on arguing in cafes - which is just how it should be.\" (136)<br /><br />\"I stood there for ages, perhaps for an hour and a half, then turned and walked back toward my hotel and realized that I had fallen spectacularly, hopelessly, and permanently in love with Italy.\" (153)<br /><br />\"I passed the Istituto Tecno Commerziale [in Naples], where a riot seemed to be in progress both inside and outside the building.  Students were hanging out the upstairs windows, tossing down books and papers and holding shouting exchanges with their colleagues on the ground.  Were this was some sort of protest or merely part of the daily routine I couldn't tell.\" (155)<br /><br />\"I walked down to the Uffizi Palace and around the Piazza della Signoria and the other fixtures of the old part of town and it was the same everywhere - throngs of people, almost all of them from abroad, shuffling about in that aimless, exasperating way of visitors, in groups of five and six, always looking at something about twenty feet above ground level.  What is it they see up there?\" (160)<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/perugia.jpg\" /><br />\"I remembered reading that it was near Lake Como that Mussolini was found hiding after Italy fell to the Allies, and I figured it must have something going for it if it was the last refuge of a desperate man.

The question for this week is what is your favorite poem and why?<br /><br />When given the choice between poetry and prose, I tend to go for a novel.  Having said that, I'm still too fickle to pick one poem I like most of all, so here are a few I love. <br /><br />Ulysses by Tennyson.  I was instantly taken by this poem the first time I read it in a high school English class.   Ulysses is tired of being in Ithaca and wants another adventure and I love the voice Tennyson gives Ulysses: \"How dull it is to pause, to make an end,/ To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!\"  Wonderful call to action.<br /><br />Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll. From high school through times in college I had this poem up on my wall.  I just love the nonsense verse and I can't help but hear the opening and closing lines in the Cheshire Cat's voice.<br /><br />Sonnet 116 by Shakespeare.  I love Shakespeare and this is my favorite of all of his sonnets.  It's the opening lines that get me: \"Let me not to the marriage of true minds/ Admit impediments. Love is not love/ Which alters when it alteration finds;\" If I were to get a tattoo, it would most likely be from this poem.  So I suppose that means this is my favorite poem.<br /><br />What's your favorite poem?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:26+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:26+00:00","published_at":"2010-12-02T13:58:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e925dde22fdcf000568","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"},{"value":"poem","slug":"poem","url":"/articles/tags/poem"}]}]},{"id":"53224e925dde2223b6000180","title":"I loved the idea that you could never be sure of anything in Europe","slug":"i-loved-the-idea-that-you-could-never-be-sure-of-anything-in-europe","url":"/articles/i-loved-the-idea-that-you-could-never-be-sure-of-anything-in-europe","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Neither+Here+Nor+There2+cover.jpg\" />I want to start my posts about Bill Bryson's Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe by saying this is one of my favorite books and one I have read multiple times.  If I start relentlessly gushing, just keep in mind I am unable to give an unbiased review.  Though now that I've typed that I realize that suggests that I believe my other reviews/posts/whathaveyou are unbiased and I don't really think that's true.  Well, now that I've spent the entire intro contradicting myself, onto the book.<br /><br />If it wasn't clear from the title, the book is about Bryson's travels through Europe. (Though if it wasn't clear, perhaps you should move along. Maybe lie down for awhile.) He somewhat retraces the trip he had taken years earlier with his friend Stephen Katz, a character you may remember from A Walk in the Woods. He tells stories about his first trip, describes his trials and tribulations navigating new cities, and describes all the wonderful and frustrating things about Europe. <br /><br />It's the style that gets me.  Bryson has the best voice for a travelogue. At least in my opinion, having hardly read any other travelogues.  None that I can think of right now anyway.  I don't really want to read about spiritual journey about self-discovery, I want to hear a funny story by a clumsy, not-very-suave guy as he goes to places that I want to see.  I've traveled a little around Europe (some Ireland, some Italy) but my current financial situation means I won't be jetting off to the continent whenever my little heart desires.  This acts as a nice stand-in if I get the urge to travel but the ATM makes a <a href=\"http://www.sadtrombone.com/\">sad trombone</a> sound when I check my balance.  And let's face it, when I travel my experiences are much closer to the awkward situations Bryson finds himself in than any journey of enlightenment. <br /><br />The book is a quick read, one of the reasons I've read it so many times.  And I tend to pick it up if I've just read something I didn't enjoy or if I want to go back to something familiar.  I know all the funny situations in the book, yet they make me laugh every time.  Bryson has a fantastic way of describing events or general observations in this amazingly witty way.  I know I've said it before but I'm pretty sure he could write about paint drying and I'd still be cracking up.  Here's a quick example of his view on countries living up to their stereotypes:<br /><blockquote>\"Germans are flummoxed by humor, the Swiss have no concept of fun, the Spanish think there is nothing at all ridiculous about eating dinner at midnight, and the Italians should never, ever have been let on to the invention of the automobile.\" (35)</blockquote>The book isn't Bryson going to a city, telling you where he ate, what museums he say and providing travel recommendations. You'd need a Lonely Planet book if that's what you want. He'll discuss the basic feeling of the city: the abundance of hippies in Amsterdam, the air of sophistication and wealth in Aachen, the fact that all Parisian drivers want him dead.  He breaks up his current journey with tales of his previous trip with Katz, as well as stories from the cities history or of his own history or just small bits of advice while traveling, such as the importance of making sure a German restaurant does not have a polka band that will surprise you during your meal.  As he says; \"It should have been written into the armistice treaty that the Germans would be required to lay down their accordions along with their arms,\" (73). <br /><br />I'm almost to my favorite part of the book, when he gets to Italy.  Reading this part always makes me long to go back.  I'm thinking that post will possibly just be a series of quotes because I'm not sure I can say anymore that I haven't already shared, yet I'm not quite finished talking about it yet.  Perhaps I'll come up with something incredibly insightful in the time being but I wouldn't count on it.<br /><br />Title quote from page 35<br /><br />Bryson, Bill.

I was in the middle of nowhere the last few days which meant I had limited online access so I'm just catching up on everything now.  It was nice to unplug but my email and Google Reader are a bit daunting at the moment.  In between stuffing my face with far too much food and playing with my dad's terror of a dachshund Puccini (my grandmother likes Italian opera and my dad likes puns), I did manage to finish The City and The City.  <br /><br /><br />I was honestly let down by the book and I partially blame this on expectations set by a blurbg on the back of the book.  A blurb from The Times says: \"The names Kafka and Orwell tend to be invoked too easily for anything a bit out of the ordinary, but in this case they are worthy comparisons.\"  I expected the <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/dopplurbanology\">dual cities</a> to be explained and to offer some sort of social commentary for the modern world.  But that never happened.  The two cities make for an interesting setting but the story remains a fairly straightforward murder mystery.  Woman found murdered because she was getting too close to The Truth, detective has to discover The Truth to solve the mystery.  It's not a bad story or a bad mystery but that blurb made me expect so much more.<br /><br />The mystery itself was interesting and I wasn't able to guess it before hand.  Of course I usually don't guess the outcome before hand so take that with a grain of salt.  Just because the book wasn't what I expected, the setting felt like more than just a gimmick.  The setting is integral to the mystery, I just wish the setting had been more important than the mystery. <br /><br />I've sat here staring at this entry for awhile and I'm not sure what else to say about the book.  Give it a try, it was an interesting story but Kafka and Orwell it is not. <br /><br />Greg at The New Dork Review has a great post about the<a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/2010/08/blurbs-blurbs-are-they-important.html\"> importance of blurbs</a> so check it out if you get a chance.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:27+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:27+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-28T14:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e935dde22fdcf00056a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"China Mieville","slug":"china-mieville","url":"/articles/tags/china-mieville"},{"value":"The City and The City","slug":"the-city-and-the-city","url":"/articles/tags/the-city-and-the-city"},{"value":"Thanksgiving","slug":"thanksgiving","url":"/articles/tags/thanksgiving"}]}]},{"id":"53224e945dde223867000302","title":"Top Holiday Books...and Movies","slug":"top-holiday-books-dot-dot-dot-and-movies","url":"/articles/top-holiday-books-dot-dot-dot-and-movies","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookcase.jpg\" />The good people over at <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/11/kimberlys-top-ten-holiday-books.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a> have asked us to name our top 10 holiday books.  Here's the thing, I don't really have holiday books and certainly not 10 of them.  I hardly ever make it to 10 on these lists anyway but I won't come close to naming 10 books.  But I still wanted to play so I'll include movies as well.  I still don't think I'll make it to 10, but I'll get closer.<br /><br />First, the books <br /><br />1. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.  I got this book when I was little and I love it because it's so funny.  Yeah it has the schmaltzy story but if that's all I want there are thousands of versions of the story.  I like Dickens voice and tone and humor. <br /> 2. How the Grinch Stole Christmas by Dr. Seuss.  I love Seuss and while this isn't my favorite of his books it's wonderful anyway.<br /><br />Well, I exhausted my holiday books quickly.  I know there are others but they aren't ones I read as a matter of tradition and so they stay off the list.  So onto movies.<br /><br />3. A Muppet Christmas Carol.  Like I just said, there are thousands of versions of A Christmas Carol out there but this one is the one I regularly watch.  Why?  Because it is almost exactly Dickens version of the story and quotes it directly over and over again.  Plus I love muppets.<br />4. Babes in Toyland.  For those that aren't familiar with this one, it's a Laurel and Hardy movie that was always on TV around the holidays.  I got excited the other day when I saw it'll be airing on Thanksgiving.  I should remember to set up the DVR for that, since I don't think I'll be able to talk others into watching it.<br />5. How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I don't really branch out much with my movies but I love Seuss and this one has singing by Tony the Tiger!  What's not to love?<br /><br />OK, so that's actually the end of my regular books and movies.  I guess we don't have a lot of regular traditions.  For Thanksgiving we usually watch a movie but it depends on what's on TV.  There's usually a Bond marathon going on so we'll catch part of that.  Last year we all watched Die Hard and I wouldn't mind if that ended up a tradition.  After I told my dad about my Halloween he asked me to bring Rocky Horror with me this year so maybe that will end up a regular thing because nothing says family gatherings and giving thanks like a group of singing alien transvestites.  <br /><br />What are your favorite holiday books, movies, TV shows, whatever?<br /><br />Update! While I looked through other people's lists I remembered on more movie/TV show I love around the holidays.  The Rankin and Bass TV movie The Year Without Santa Claus.  I love the Heat Miser and Snow Miser songs. I like the other Rankin and Bass movies but this is my favorite, followed in close second by the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer movie because of the Island of the Misfit Toys and the Abominable Snowman.

For the first part of the book I haven't really had too much to say.  It's not that it's uninteresting, it's just difficult for me to give all of my attention to it because it's difficult to really grasp the world the story takes place in.  I still have more than half the book to get through but I want to try to explain the setting and try to work out whether the setting is helping or hurting the story.<br /><br />The story is a fairly typical crime story: a woman's body is found and Inspector Borlu has to solve the murder.  But the setting is what makes the story something more.  The woman's body is found in Beszel but she was most recently working and living in Ul Qoma.  These two cities actually exist in the same physical location but due to a schism that has yet to be explained, the two places don't interact.  Not only do they not interact, they're not allowed to interact.  Even if your neighbor's house is an arm's length away from you, if your neighbor lives in Ul Qoma and you live in Beszel you have to \"unsee\" their house.  If you failed to unsee, you will have breached, which means a committee that is above the laws of either Beszel or Ul Qoma will come and deal with you and you will not be heard from again.  Here's Borlu explaining some of the (very little) leniency with Breach.<br /><blockquote>\"If I or one of my friends were to have a moments failure of unseeing (and who did not do that?  who failed to fail to see, sometimes?), so long as it was not flaunted or indulged in, we should not be in danger.  If you were to glance a second or two on some attractive passerby in Ul Qoma, if I were to silently enjoy the skyline of the two cities together, be irritated by the noise of an Ul Qoman train, I would not be taken.\" (64)</blockquote>The two cities inhabit the same physical space but they must live in different worlds.  The people do acknowledge that the places are sharing the same space but to claim that the two cities are one in the same is blasphemy.  The citizens have a word for same physical space but vastly different places: grosstopical.  <br /><br />These two cities don't exist on some foreign land or even distance future where all countries are like this.  The girl that was found murdered is from the US, studying in Canada and attending her universities campus within Ul Qoma to work on her archaeology PhD.  They don't go into much detail about how other countries view the cities  unique position but, from the standpoint of the locals, it is certainly  tolerated.  The girl and others who wish to visit either Beszel or Ul Qoma must take a 2 week long intensive course so they can learn to unsee the other city-state before they are issued a visa.    Tourists have to learn to not only unsee foreign buildings that are right in front of them, but also unsee foreign people who are sharing the same sidewalk as them.  You cannot notice them but you also can't walk through people as if they aren't there.  You have to avoid them without noticing them or be guilty of Breach. (If you notice them, Breach!  If you do such a good job of not seeing them that you run into them, Breach!)  Borlu describes an incident from his childhood, when Breach showed up after an Ul Qoma van skidded on Ul Qoma streets and hit a Beszel vehicle.<br /><blockquote>In seconds, the Breach came.  Shapes, figures, some of whom perhaps had been there but who nonetheless seemed to coalesce from spaces between the smoke of the accident, moving too fast it seemed to be clearly seen, moving with authority and power so absolute that within seconds they can controlled, contained the area of intrusion. (81)</blockquote>It takes a little while to learn all of the rules for the cities.  At no point does the narrator give all of the information to the reader.  You get clues that something isn't quite right for awhile until finally the details fall into place.  The problem with this is I had trouble focusing on the text, which was very clearly avoiding  the details.  In World War Z the reader doesn't get all of the details because it's clear that everyone is already familiar with the details and this style works.  You're given enough to follow what's going on while enough is held back that it a) feels real and b) lets you fill in some of the details yourself to make it even scarier.  The City &amp; The City isn't a horror story so there is no reason for the reader to fill in the unknowns to make it scarier and the missing details are confusing.  My friend that recommended the book to me had tried to explain the dopplurbanology (as it is called in the book) but it is hard to explain.  I'm not sure if already having an idea about the 2 cities made the beginning more confusing or not but now that more of the rules are explained the narrative flows better. <br /><br />As it stands I am more interested in the 2 cities than I am in the murder, now that I have more information and can follow the setting better.  So far the cities have served only as an interesting setting but I'm hoping the schism will be examined and will end up being more than just a trick.<br /><br />Title quote from page 113","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:28+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:28+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-22T13:52:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e945dde2223b6000183","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"China Mieville","slug":"china-mieville","url":"/articles/tags/china-mieville"},{"value":"The City and The City","slug":"the-city-and-the-city","url":"/articles/tags/the-city-and-the-city"}]}]},{"id":"53224e945dde22641900063f","title":"How to pick out fragrance","slug":"how-to-pick-out-fragrance","url":"/articles/how-to-pick-out-fragrance","body":"I was out with Boyfriend the other day and while he looked at shirts and ties and other super exciting things, I was playing with the fragrances on display. <br /><br />My credentials for telling you how to pick out fragrance:<br />1.

This week's topic is the top ten villains, criminals and degenerates.  The villains are usually more interesting than the heroes so I'm hoping to make it to 10.  Let's see...<br /><ol><li>Acheron Hades from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde Acheron is the primary villain of The Eyre Affair, the first book in the Thursday Next series.  He can \"lie in thought, deed, action, and appearance\", is incredibly strong and more than anything else, he is incredibly intelligent and completely immoral.  <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/my-quote-as-title-idea-is-already\">His only purpose is to be evil</a>, \"committing loathsome and detestable acts...purely for their own sake\". What more can you ask for in a villain?</li><li>Aornis Hades from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde Aornis is Acheron's little sister.  She may not have all of Acheron's powers but she has her own tricks up her sleeve and she's just as evil.  She is a mnemonomorph (trying saying that three times fast.  Or, you know, once.  I can't.) meaning she can alter memories.  She is not quite as intelligent as her brother but she is by no means dumb and she causes plenty of damage.</li><li>Iago from Shakespeare's Othello I love Shakespeare and Iago is one of my favorite characters.  He embodies the Machiavellian archetype; he uses what's around him, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/law-of-transitives-andothello\">can think on his feet</a> and is extremely smart and manipulative.  He doesn't seem to have a motive.  Sometimes he says he hates Othello because he promoted Cassio over him.  Other times he claims Othello slept with his wife Emilia.  Then other times he says he's in love with Desdemona and I've read read interpretations where he was actually in love with Othello.  He is remorseless and refuses to explain his actions.</li><li>The zombies in World War Z by Max Brooks These guys go a different route from the other 3 I've mentioned: they aren't intelligent, they don't really have any special \"powers\" (unless you consider being able to exist in general a power) and they aren't even evil.  But I just finished reading World War Z and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/couldnt-just-one-restart-plague-all\">I don't want to go up against them</a>. I won't make it.</li><li>Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris Back to the crazy smart villains! Crazy smart and crazy, smart describe Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter. Harris gets you to root for him without ever really trying to make you sympathize with him.  And Hannibal is a scarier villain than Buffalo Bill, who is making a lady suit out of real lady skins.  The fact that he can outshine that says more than I could describe.</li><li>Annie Wilkes from Misery by Stephen King Oh Annie Wilkes, Paul Sheldon's number one fan. She has so much power over Paul and very little grasp of reality, a dangerous combination. And she's pretty good at wielding that electric knife...</li><li>Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J.K. Rowling There are lots of villains in the HP universe but Umbridge is the one I hate the most.  Her punishments are sadistic and every time she did her little passive aggressive cough thing I wanted someone to punch her.  I know that wouldn't have actually fit in the story, it just would have been nice.  </li><li>Patrick Bateman from American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis Considering how often I've said how much I dislike this book, I seem to <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-10-scariest-books\">talk about it a lot</a>.  Bateman is a sociopath who engages in \"murder, rape, cannibalism, torture, necrophilia and other wholesome activities.\"  He describes his horrendous acts in the same tone he describes the outfit of every single person around him (I hated when he went to parties) or detailing the history of the band Genesis.  The movie is great though, especially the business card scene.  </li></ol>Well I made it to 8.  That's not so bad.  What are some of your top villains? <br /><ol></ol>","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:29+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:29+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-16T14:23:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e955dde22fdcf00056c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e955dde223867000304","title":"Temporary re-reading hiatus","slug":"temporary-re-reading-hiatus","url":"/articles/temporary-re-reading-hiatus","body":"I re-read books a lot.  It comes down to a couple reasons.  One of the top ones is that I'm cheap.  The library is an option I suppose, but it's not one I usually use.  I prefer to have my own copies.  I don't write in them, which would be a reasonable excuse for wanting my own copies.  I just like having my own.  Logic doesn't always come into play with my reasons.<br /><br />I also like re-reading because I like the books I'm reading again.  If I like a movie, I can watch it over and over again (see: Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Dogma, Zombieland).  Books are the same way for me.  Some are short and sweet stories that I use as a literary palate cleanser, like The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged).  I know that play well enough I can mostly recite it.  I know there are a lot of books out there but I am hardly planning on reading everything out there so I may as well enjoy what I am reading. <br /><br />And then of course there are books I read awhile ago that I liked and want to talk about on this blog.  World War Z falls into that category.  I don't know what I would have re-read it quite so quickly if I didn't have this blog but I wanted to write about it, so I re-read it. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Agent-Next-book-haul.jpg\" />Both Brother and Friend have lent me a few books, so I will be reading some all new stuff.  In addition to World War Z, Brother lent me Doctor No by Ian Flemming.  I've mentioned <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-goes-by-many-names-crisis-dark-years\">Brother isn't a big reader</a>, but he is a Bond fan and he enjoyed this one so I thought I'd check it out.  Then Friend sent a package, c/o Agent Thursday Next (my friend and I are geeky), containing a copy of Galapagos by Kurt Vonnegut I'd lent him a while back as well as 2 new (to me) books: The City &amp; The City by China Mieville and Special Topics in Calamity Physics by Marisha Pessl. <br /><br />The Mieville book is actually another Friend's book, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/if-you-have-any-doubt-which-will-dent\">he who recommended Kitchen Confidential</a> to me.  A while back we were sitting at dinner and he was telling me about this amazing book and how it's kind of odd and I had to check it out because odd is kind of up my alley.  I was going to take it home with me and I, of course, forgot because I have the same memory as a goldfish.  My forgetfulness was in my other friend's favor, as he got to borrow the book first.  He also said it was a good read so I'm looking forward to it. <br /><br />The Pessl book makes me a bit nervous, because \"physics\" is in the title.  I know some people find physics amazingly interesting, like my friend who had an except from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> lecture read at her wedding.  I am not part of that group.  I also know (hope!) this isn't actually about straight physics.  I trust my friend wouldn't steer me wrong.<br /><br />So that's on my book reading schedule.  Of course I tend to pick what book I'll read next by my mood, so all \"upcoming reads\" items are subject to change at a moments notice.  And of course I have a Bryson re-read thrown in there as well.  Just can't get away, what can I say.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:29+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:29+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-15T15:33:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e955dde223867000305","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Re-Reading","slug":"re-reading","url":"/articles/tags/re-reading"},{"value":"TBR list","slug":"tbr-list","url":"/articles/tags/tbr-list"}]}]},{"id":"53224e955dde226419000641","title":"100 Followers!!","slug":"100-followers","url":"/articles/100-followers","body":"I know the amount of followers you have isn't really important and some people (I'm sure a good portion of those people) are following me without really reading and lots of other excuses as to why I shouldn't be excited BUT I hit 100 followers today.<br /><br />To those that follow me I want to say a big THANK YOU!

I have found some great reads over there but the majority of the blogs are not my style.  As such I'm happy those over at <a href=\"http://thebluebookcase.blogspot.com/2010/11/literary-blog-hop-nov-11-14.html\">The Blue Bookcase</a> have started their own literary blog hop.  Not every book I read and talk about on this site is a literary masterpiece, but this is far more my thing.  I missed the hop last week as I had already posted for the other hop when I saw this one going around so I decided to wait around until this week to join in.  I also would have probably held off on my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/couldnt-just-one-restart-plague-all\">final World War Z post</a> until tomorrow had I realized this hop started today.  I'm not good at the small details or planning in general so I suppose doing it this way is more my style anyway.<br /><br />Sorry for the rambling and now onto the question: What's the most difficult literary work you've ever read?  What made it so difficult?<br /><br />When I saw this question Toni Morrison's Beloved instantly came to mind.  There is so much to take in, so many themes and devices and it can be difficult to follow what's going on, not because the book is poorly written but because it is so rich there are so many different ways to see each scene, particularly the character Beloved.  And the subject matter itself is heartbreaking.  The experiences the characters have gone through are hard to read and hard to believe that while the characters themselves are fictional the abuse they went through was true for so many. I've mentioned in a <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/top-10-books-that-made-me-cry\">previous post</a> how other novels by Morrison deal with such heavy topics but Beloved is at the top of that list.  It's hard not to emotionally start to shut down while reading it.  But having said this, it is worth it.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:30+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:30+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-11T19:23:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e965dde2223b6000185","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Literary Blog Hop","slug":"literary-blog-hop","url":"/articles/tags/literary-blog-hop"},{"value":"Toni Morrison","slug":"toni-morrison","url":"/articles/tags/toni-morrison"}]}]},{"id":"53224e965dde22fdcf00056d","title":"Couldn't just one restart the plague all over again?","slug":"couldnt-just-one-restart-the-plague-all-over-again","url":"/articles/couldnt-just-one-restart-the-plague-all-over-again","body":"Between finishing up World War Z and watching The Walking Dead series I have learned a couple things about myself.<br /><br />1. I will not survive a zombie apocalypse.<br />I have no chance.  I mentioned in my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-goes-by-many-names-crisis-dark-years\">first WWZ post</a> that my zombie contingency plan mostly resembles the second option on the <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/whats-your-zombie-contingency-plan-11-practical-strategies/\">What's Your Zombie Contingency Plan page </a>(The \"I Will Miss You Dearly\" stratagem).  But let's assume for a second I'm not quite that helpless, then my second plan probably follows the first option the \"I Had A Good Plan But Then I Tripped,\" especially the tripping part.  Here's the \"con\" to this plan, which is the part I would probably follow most closely: \"I once ran face-first into a sliding glass door.  I am not competent enough to do any of this [plan]. I would probably trip over my own feet and stumble slap-stick style into an undead group hug.\"  My mom sometimes says I'm about as graceful as a cow on ice (which is what her dad used to tell her cos walking into walls is a family tradition) and after reading World War Z and seeing how many intelligent, prepared, non-clumsy people couldn't make it out, I know I would stand no chance.<br /><br />2. Before inevitably being eaten by the zombies, I will probably take down a lot of innocent, non-zombified people.<br />If you were to watch The Walking Dead with me, something I wouldn't recommend unless you've already seen the episode, you'll notice I yell at the screen.  A lot.  And most often what I yell is \"Ah, it's moving!  Shoot it!  Shoot it!\"g  Please notice I didn't say \"a zombie is moving\" just \"it\" and this is because I am not distinguishing between an actual threat and a healthy person who just happens to be moving. Anytime anything around me moves, I would shoot at it.  This means not only am I probably hitting innocent people, I'm also wasting ammo.  If I don't get eaten by zombies I should probably be put down by whoever I'm with to keep from making the situation worse.  Or be left for zombie bait. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/WWZ_contest_winner.jpg\" />One of the scariest things about World War Z is the hopelessness of the situation.  People panic, weapons fail, governments collapse and the zombies keep coming.  One of the scariest things pointed out (that probably should have been obvious) is the fact that the human army keeps dwindling but the zombie population rises.  Not every person lost becomes a zombie but a lot of them do, which means you can keep fighting but the enemies numbers just keep growing.  The story takes place just over 10 years after the zombie war is over, but all this means is the human race hasn't been completely wiped out by zombies.  Zacks still control a large portion of the land so even when I say the war is over that just means the all out constant fighting is mostly over.  Civilization still needs to be rebuilt and once things are calm and stable people will need to come to terms with what has happened. <br /><blockquote>I've heard it said that the Holocaust has no survivors, that even those who managed to remain technically alive were so irreparably damaged, that their spirit, their soul, the person that they were supposed to be, was gone forever.  I'd like to think that's not true.  But if it is, then no on on Earth survived this war. (340)</blockquote>But, while things seem hopeless, there is a small sliver of hope.  Humanity did survive and the all out fighting did end.  Things haven't been easy and won't be easy but there is a chance.<br /><br />For those that haven't heard, there is a strong possibility of a <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/goog_2101867639\">World War Z</a><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/\"> movie</a> with Brad Pitt confirmed to play the lead.  I know, it's exciting.  I know I say \"possibility\" and \"confirmed\" but even though he's confirmed I'm going to go ahead and say until ads start running, there is the possibility the movie won't get made.  I'd rather be pleasantly surprised over let down.<br /><br />I had the same reaction to every alien in District 9.  I know you're supposed to learn that people are the ugly ones and the aliens don't mean any harm but no amount of Disney eyes on the little one or red vests on the adult made me like them.  I'm sorry.  I'm a bad person.<br /><br />Title quote from page 266<br /><br />Brooks, Max<span>.</span><span> </span><span>World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War</span><span>.

As I mentioned in my previous post, World War Z takes place more than a decade after the zombie war has finished, although the infected still have control of certain parts of the world.  It's not a single narrative but instead of collection of interviews and stories from survivors of the war as they look back on \"the plague years\".  And because this is a history that both the tellers and the presumed audience is already familiar with, the details aren't always spelled out and you, the actual reader, has to fill in the holes. Which means you spend lots of time filling in those uncertainties with your own scenarios and personally, I shouldn't let my mind wander like that.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/432_realsize.jpg\" />As the book goes on you do get more and more details about the outbreak but the first two chapters, Warnings and Blame, are so unsettling.  There are few moments when something jumps out at you and they aren't the most gory scenes; these are the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night chapters.  And what's especially frightening is the realism.  The book takes place on the global scale, complete with the prejudices and fighting between countries. Early on Israel figures out what's going on and the country goes into voluntary quarantine, offering asylum to certain people, including \"any Palestinian living in the formerly occupied territories, and any Palestinian whose family had once lived within the borders of Israel\" (37).  Obviously there has been some Israeli-Palestinian disagreements for the last few millenia, so it's interesting to read the story from the point of view of a Palestinian man whose family goes to Israel for protection.  Anger and suspicion and fear fill his narrative; it's easy to see how the problem could grow so long without a global reaction.<br /><br />This book is scary not just because of the zombies (although they aren't  exactly pleasant)  but also because of how people react in a crisis;  those who panic, those who help and those who look after self-interest  only. There are all sorts that provide their voice to this \"oral history\", and many of the people cause just as much harm as the zombies.  Or at least they allow the problem to grow out of control.  There are stories from people on the organ black market, that sold infected organs and helped spread the disease across the globe, there are people who created placebo vaccines that did absolutely nothing to stop the virus but made the inventors lots of money.  This isn't to say the book paints a picture where everyone is evil and corrupt.  One character describes the awful things people did to one another and his description of the good vs. bad people exemplifies the tone of the book, so far anyway: \"I'm just highlighting the most extreme negative examples, you understand.  For every one profiteer, or repulsive psychopath, there were ten good and decent people whose karma was still untainted\" (72).  And the zombies are pretty terrifying as well.<br /><br />I really want to check out the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war_z#Audiobook\">audio book version of this novel</a>, but I'm also a little afraid to actually listen to it.  There's a story told by the point of view of a woman who lives in a rehab home for feral children.  She has the mind of a four year old and hearing a zombie attack from a child's point of view is terrifying, especially because she imitates not only the voices of the other people during the attack but of the zombie moaning, the pounding on the doors, the gun fire, the screams.

The questions this week are: What are your feelings on losing followers? Have you ever stopped following a blog?<br />I'm sad when I lose followers.  There are questions asked: Wasn't I good enough for you?  What do you want from me?? But then I realized I'd rather have followers that actually want to read what I write instead of someone that started following me solely in the hopes that I would follow them back.  I know my blog isn't for everyone and that's fine.  <br />To answer the second question: yes I stop following blogs.  As I just said, I want people to follow me if they want to actually read what I write.  Keeping with that line of thinking, I only follow blogs if I like to read them.  When I first started blogging I would follow anyone that followed me.  Eventually my blog list was huge and I realized I wasn't really reading the majority of them.  Since then I only follow blogs if I like what I see, but sometimes I still end up with blogs that I'm not really engaged with.  So every once in awhile I'll go through the list and do some purging.  That doesn't mean the blogs I stop following are bad; it just means they aren't for me.  It's not you it's me, I'm setting you free, you'd be better with somebody else.g<br />Do you stop following blogs?  How do you decide what blogs to follow?<br />Once I don't know the roman numerals anymore I'll switch to some new blog title for these.

I suppose in reality if you ask me now I'll still say no.  Perhaps I'll elaborate and say I like zombies in the same way that I like pirates and ninjas.  The internet has decided these things are funny and they show up everywhere and eventually you get worn down and agree that yes, zombies, pirates and ninjas are awesome.  But even knowing the internet's power, the amount of zombie media I have consumed still confuses me.  Pirates can be pinned on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and as a child I grew up with the Ninja Turtles, so I at least have some background with these topics.  Completely fake, pop culture based backgrounds, but backgrounds nonetheless.  I've been trying to figure out how zombies got added to my own mix and here's a timeline I've come up with.<br /><br />Pre-2004 - Zombie stuff happens but I don't care yet<br /><br />2004 - <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> comes out<br /><br />2006 - I actually get around to seeing this movie.  I think it's funny enough to eventually see <em>Hot Fuzz</em> but don't think too much more about it<br /><br />2008 - during a job interview I'm conducting I get bored with the string of typical answers to typical questions and ask the interviewee \"Zombies are attacking the city.  What's your first move?\"  I decide the question elicites funny responses, either in the form of great answers or just confused looks, and I start using the question in other interviews and when meeting friends' significant others for the first time.  I find it's a good way to weed out people without a sense of humor.<br /><br />2009 - <em>Zombieland</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> both come out. Boyfriend and I decide to see <em>Zombieland, </em>most likely because there was nothing else we wanted to see.  I love it!  Boyfriend is (rightly) baffled by this.  A few months later I'm in my neighborhood bookstore and a women is buying a bunch of zombie books because the local theater is having a screening of <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> followed by a zombie expert answering questions and she's picking up door prizes. (Side note, I love both the local bookstore and the local theater.) She decides against <em>P&amp;P&amp;Z</em> and I ask the cashier to throw it on my pile.  The book is hilarious and the book title is exactly right.  It is primarily the text of <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>but anytime the story starts to have one too many dances, meals or carriage rides BAM zombies attack.  I have lots of conversations with people while reading the book in public.  The cover draws lots of interest.<br /><br />2010 - <em>Zombieland</em> comes out on DVD and I buy it on release day.  Around this time Brother is looking for a book to read.  He's not exactly what you would call a reader, so I'm surprised to hear he's actually looking for something to read by choice.  He's looking for <em>World War Z</em> and says it's about zombies.  I tell him about my new found zombie appreciation and he lends it to me after he's read it.  Brother fails to mention <em>World War Z</em> is not a funny book.  Laughs at me when I tell him I didn't know it would be serious.  Brother can be a bit of a jerk.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/World_War_Z_book_cover.jpg\" />So here I am now.  I've actually read <em>WWZ</em> once before I started this blog but I enjoyed it enough, and wanted to write about it enough, to start reading it again.  This book has shown me that my conscious and my subconscious really can't agree on anything.  My conscious isn't afraid of zombies.  When I'm awake I think they're funny because they're slow (usually) and stupid and not very scary.  Especially if you read the Cracked article about how a <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_18683_7-scientific-reasons-zombie-outbreak-would-fail-quickly.html\">zombie apocalypse would fail.</a>  But the first time I read this I had zombie nightmares many nights.  They wake me up, which really only serves to annoy me.  Unlike normal nightmares where you still feel the residual fear, even when you know there's nothing to be afraid of, I wake up from these dreams just annoyed that I'm awake.  I know I was just dreaming about zombies; when I close my eyes I can see them again.  But I don't have any of that fear.  Instead all I think is \"It's 3 in the morning, I have to get up in a few hours, and I don't want these zombies waking me up anymore.  This is annoying.\"  Not only do I now have zombie nightmares while reading the book, but now that I've read <em>WWZ</em>, other zombie things give me the same unscary zombie nightmares.  My subconscious needs to get it together so I can enjoy my zombies but still get a full night's sleep.<br /><br />I swear my next post will actually discuss the book. In the meantime, check out this list of<a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/whats-your-zombie-contingency-plan-11-practical-strategies/\"> zombie contingency plans</a> from <a href=\"http://cracked.com/\">Cracked.com</a>.  Mine most closely resembles the second one.  I will not survive a zombie apocalypse.  (I should get some credit or something from Cracked, seeing how I've mentioned them twice in this article alone.  They have a lot of zombie related articles.)<br /><br />Title quote from page 1","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:31+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:31+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-03T12:58:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e975dde22fdcf000570","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Max Brooks","slug":"max-brooks","url":"/articles/tags/max-brooks"},{"value":"World War Z","slug":"world-war-z","url":"/articles/tags/world-war-z"}]}]},{"id":"53224e985dde223867000308","title":"Top 10 Books That Made Me Cry","slug":"top-10-books-that-made-me-cry","url":"/articles/top-10-books-that-made-me-cry","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TuesTop10.jpg\" />Another Tuesday, another top 10 list hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/11/top-ten-tuesday-top-ten-books-that-made.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a>. Last week it was books that make you scream and this week it's books that make you cry.  I don't think I'll make it to 10 because I like to think I'm tough but I'm such baby I am a step above crying at long distance phone commercials.  So with that in mind here are the top however-many-I-make-it-to books that make me cry.  (Keep in mind that most of the time if a book made me cry it was something at the end that did it.  So there will probably be spoilers.)<br /><br /><ol><li>Lamb by Christopher Moore. This is in my top 5 favorite books but the ending to it is so sad.  And it's not like I didn't know what was going to happen (spoiler: Josh gets crucified) but the book is so funny throughout the first half of it that the emotion in the second half of the book is surprising.  </li><li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling. I'm so glad I read the end of this book while I was at home instead of on the T because I'm pretty sure I would have caused a scene and then I would have had to make up some story about a severe allergic reaction or something to cover up the fact that a kids book made me cry.  Notable mentions in this category: Order of the Phoenix.  I didn't want to include multiple HP's on this list and I didn't bawl as much with this one, but that ending depressed me.  Especially after I'd gotten so attached.</li><li>A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. This is such a powerful, tragic story. It is so sad with only a very small silver lining.  The story is fiction but so many real women live the hell that Mariam and Laila go through.  The book was hard to read and I probably won't be re-reading this one, but I'm glad I read it the first time.</li><li> The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. Morrison's work is so heavy but this was the first of her books I read and because of that it's the one that hits me the hardest.  Incestual child rape: fun for the whole family.  (I know that was awful and tasteless and I actually wrote it at first without realizing how bad it was but it also made me laugh out loud so it stays.  I have a 10 year old boys taste in humor.)</li></ol>I tried to come up with more.  I even looked through my mostly-complete list of books I have and this is still all I could come up with.  I didn't want to go with books that made me just tear up a little bit; nothing I could explain away by saying I have dust in my eye.  If you decide to read any of these, fair warning. <br />What books made you cry?<br /><br />Update!: I realized I forgot The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and normally I'd just leave it off the list but since this book made me cry in public (dammit) I need to add it. Holocaust books will do that to you.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:32+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:32+00:00","published_at":"2010-11-02T13:31:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e985dde223867000309","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e985dde22386700030a","title":"They faced each other through a fraction of eternity","slug":"they-faced-each-other-through-a-fraction-of-eternity","url":"/articles/they-faced-each-other-through-a-fraction-of-eternity","body":"<span>I finished (well finished again) Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories, a collection of ghost stories compiled by Dahl.  I didn't actually read all of the stories in the second half.  There were a couple I tried to read and just kept putting the book down.  And then I remembered if I don't want to read it I don't have to so I moved onto the next one.  For the most part, Dahl picked out some great, creepy stories but we can't all have the same taste.  And there were a couple great ones in the second half such as the 3 stories below. </span><span><br /></span><span>\"Ringing the Changes\" by Robert Aikman</span><span>This is one of the longer stories in the collection and that time is taken to set the scene.  This is probably the most unsettling story because for the majority of the story you and the main characters, know something is wrong but you can't tell why.  People are behaving strangely but when you try to figure out what exactly is so strange you can easily come up with plausible, non-threatening explanations.  And the bells that are constantly ringing, so loudly the characters can hardly hear anything else.  The tension and the eerie feeling builds and builds until it finally comes to a scary culmination.  </span><span><br /></span><span>gSpoilers</span><span>The other thing I liked about this story is the fact that it's a turn of the century zombie story.  I though zombies were a more modern creation, at least in terms of making it into horror stories that don't take place in Haiti (thank you NatGeo Zombie Documentary).  These aren't the same brain-eating zombies but \"the dead are awake\" (139, emphasis mine).</span><span>End Spoilers</span><span><br /></span><span>\"The Ghost of a Hand\" by J. Sheridan Le Fanu</span><span><span>This is the story to read late at night while you're alone.  There's a disembodied hand that is constantly knocking on doors, tapping on window panes, running its hand along the wall, perhaps to find a point of entrance.  The ghostly presence is more often heard than seen, which means every little sound made me jump.  I expected to see a fat white hand up against the window.  I think the best horror stories are the ones where you are so completely pulled into the story that you start to see it around you.  </span></span><br /><br />\"The Sweeper\" by A.M. Burrage<br /><span><span><span>Death takes on so many different forms throughout literature but the purpose is always the same.  I wish we could have seen more of the woman death was waiting for, Miss Ludgate.  She's a wealthy old woman described as \"rich enough to be indifferent, but old enough to be crotchety\" (162).  I wish we could have seen more of her but the story is told from a young woman who joins the household, mostly to keep Miss Ludgate company and to help with all of the beggars that stop by the property.  Miss Ludgate may be stingy with her money when it comes to the monthly bills, but she never turns away a beggar looking for a handout.  The story isn't particularly scary like the other 2 I mentioned.  Instead it's just a good story with </span></span></span>interesting characters, told well.<br /><br />The title quote comes from this story and I enjoy Burrage's style. This is the same author that wrote my favorite story from this collection, \"Playmates\", which I mentioned in my<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/such-ordinary-things-make-me-afraid\">previous post</a><span>.</span><br /><br />I feel like I started the whole reading-Halloween stories late, so I'll probably stick to this genre for a few more books. Especially if I happen to pick up The Haunting of Hill House sometime soon. And of course I think I'll re-read World War Z soon because I decided I've been sleeping too well recently and should probably break up the night with some ridiculous not-scary-when-I'm-awake nightmares.<br /><br />Title quote from page 175.<br /><br />Aikman, Robert. \"Ringing the Changes.\" Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories.

It's huge and heavy but pretty so I keep using it.  </li><li>Keys. I'm always paranoid I'll forget these and get locked out so I have them on a huge lanyard from college that gets tangled in all the other things in my bag, but makes it really easy to find them.  It also has a New Jersey bottle opener on it so win.</li><li>Book. Currently it's <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/such-ordinary-things-make-me-afraid\">Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories</a>.  The fact that I keep a book in my bag at (almost) all times is the reason I avoid hardbacks.  So if Fforde and Bryson would like to hurry up and push their latest pieces to paperback, I would be most appreciative.</li></ol> Four Favorite Things in My Bedroom<br /><ol><li>Bed. As it stands my bedroom is very small so the bed takes up about 85% of it.  It's not that I think this bed is the best ever but I do love sleep.</li><li>TV/DVD/VCR I like to fall asleep to something but I don't have cable hooked up in my room, so I've been watching DVDs.  I recently finished re-watching the entire <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Critic\">Critic</a> series and 1 disc from the Simpsons season 8 with my favorite episode \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Move_Twice\">You Only Move Twice</a>\".  I'm now onto watching the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Earth_%28TV_series%29\">Planet Earth</a> series.</li><li>Window AC. I don't know why it's been hot and humid in Boston recently, but my window AC at least makes sleeping possible.  I'm pretty sure that's how an army of mosquitoes has been getting in, but seeing as I have no where to store the AC if it's not in the window, it'll stay there and I'll just keep blasting the window with bug spray. </li><li>My dresser I had some trouble coming up with the last item and this is essentially the only other thing in the room.  But I do appreciate that it holds some of my clothes. The rest are down the hall in a closet/room off the living room.  (By the way, there is a good chance this closet is larger than my room, but I don't want to depress myself by actually measuring and finding out that is true.) And keeps my TV at eye level.</li></ol> Four Things on My Desk<br /><ol><li>My Computer The only desk I have is at work so I'm just naming stuff on there and surprise! It has a computer</li><li>Drawings, doodles, cutouts. It looks like kindergarten art class projects have vomited all over my desk. When Co-Worker was here we would make drawings for one another so in between post-its with important phone numbers I have a drawing of a duck eating Sun Chips and a giraffe flying a WWII plane.</li><li>Cheap Decorative fan I won it at this amazing place called <a href=\"http://www.goodtimeemporium.com/\">Good Time Emporium</a> that has since shut down to make way for an Ikea.  Now I love Ikea but I also love a place where I can play skee ball, laser tag, pool and drink all in one super sketchy location.</li><li>Drink containers I currently have 1 reusable water bottle, one bottle of sparkling flavored water, 2 foam cups from Dunkin, 1 plastic cup from Dunkin (I need to throw out), an empty water bottle (also needs thrown out) and an over sized coffee mug that needs washed.  I am not a particularly neat person apparently.</li></ol>Four Things I've Always Wanted to Do (but Haven't Yet)<br /><ol><li>Move to Seattle This is actually a relatively new thing, but ever since I've visited I want to live there.  At least for a few years.</li><li>Visit Australia/New Zealand   It looks so beautiful out there that I will get over the 25hour flight just to visit.  You know, and find the necessary funds to make the trip happen.</li><li>Learn a foreign language fluently I took French for roughly 10,000 years from middle school through college but I still suck at it.  I'm far better at Italian but even that is barely passable now.  </li><li>Figure out a long term career I change my mind a lot but maybe at some point I'll think of something I want to do for the long haul.  Owning a bookstore would be nice.</li></ol> Four Things I Enjoy Very Much at the Moment<br /><ol><li>ABP's Pumpkin Soup Now if only the location over here would stop being lazy and start carrying it.  Fall's going to end soon people!</li><li>Boots I have so many pairs but I still want more.  So pretty</li><li>The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Rocky Horror Picture Show My two favorite Halloween time movies. I should probably splurge and buy a DVD copy of Nightmare.  The VHS is getting worn down.</li><li>El Guapo burrito from El Pelon I'm not eating one now but I suddenly got a craving. Might be a quest for the weekend.</li></ol>Four Songs I Can't Get Out of My Head<br /><ol><li>Electric Avenue by some guy that made an annoying song I read something that referenced this song the other day and now it's stuck in there</li><li>New York, New York by Sinatra   Must have come on my iPod at some point.  That's the fun thing about listening to music during my commute.  I don't usually pay all that much attention to what's playing but I'll suddenly find myself humming some song.</li><li>Drunken Lullabies by Flogging Molly Also came on the Shmuffle recently</li><li>Time Warp from Rocky Horror It's just a jump to the left...</li></ol> Four Things You Don't Know About Me<br /><ol><li>I love punk, ska and Broadway musicals My music taste is a bit schizo but it makes me happy.  And the American Idiot Broadway soundtrack is the perfect storm of those things I love. </li><li>I keep my nails painted at all times or else I bite them I bite them even when they are painted, but it is more of a deterrent.  And I'm not a big fan of red/pink/french manicure nails.  Recently I've been keeping them green but currently they're black</li><li>I love Tosh.0  The show just consists of tasteless jokes and gross internet videos and yet I love it.</li><li>I get Ebert's newsletter emailed to me weekly yet I won't read the review until I've seen the movie.  And then once I have seen the movie, I'll look up reviews elsewhere and won't usually go back through my email to see if the review is there.

I loved Dahl as a child and I have a book of his short stories aimed at adults, so I was very excited when I found this book.  So excited in fact, that I didn't notice Dahl didn't actually write these stories.  He just compiled them.  Whoops.  I was disappointed when I found this out but the disappointment didn't last for long because Dahl picked out some great stories and he includes a number of short stories written by women.  In the intro he decides \"women have an unusual flair for writing about the supernatural,\" (14) and I'm personally always happy to see a story written by a female writer that doesn't completely center on finding a man and/or shoe shopping.<br /><br />I've gone through half of the book so far and the stories about children have been the ones that stood out to me. Most likely because children scare me.  Unsettling tiny people...Anyway here are my thoughts on the creepy children stories.<br /><br />\"Harry\" by Rosemary Timperley<br />The post title actually comes from this story.  The main character begins the story talking about the ordinary things that frighten her: \"Sunshine. Sharp shadows on grass. White roses. Children with red hair.\"g  (33) Mr. and Mrs. James have adopted a young girl who was the only member of her family to survive her father's attempted family murder/suicide, saved by her brother's sacrifice.  Christine has made an invisible friend that her mother cannot stand but the more Mrs. James rails against him, the more Christine retreats to the friend in the garden.<br /><br />\"Playmates\" by A.M. Burrage<br />A creepy Victorian bachelor decides he would make an awesome parent so he takes on a ward whose father just died and no one else seems to want, so he see if teaching her the bare minimum (though giving her access to a full library so she can mostly teach herself) and keeping her from other children will make her the perfect person.  This results in the girl being well cared for physically but sullen; she never laughs, she never plays. The man, the little girl and the household servants move from the city to the country, where the little girl begins to play and smile and seems to have a group of invisible friends.<br /><br /><br />So the first thing you'll notice is kids who talk to invisible friends are actually talking to ghosts so you'd better watch out. And kids are totally unafraid of ghosts because child ghosts apparently make fantastic playmates.  The creepiness comes from the fact that the children are interacting with something otherworldly in an entirely nonchalant way.  These companions make perfect sense and are preferred to real children around them.  The adults may try to deny a presence but their own reluctance shows how much they really believe in the friends are real and more than just an overactive imagination.  The stories aren't frightening so much as they are unsettling.  You won't scream while reading these stories but you will feel uneasy.  Dahl says in the intro the reason he compiled these stories was originally for a TV show.  It sounded like The Twilight Zone and any of the stories would fit into that sort of format.  Less sci-fi, more horror, all creepy.  It's too bad the show never got picked up; I'd love to have seen some of these stories made into short movie.<br /><br /><br />Man, red heads just get picked on left and right.  For other examples see: <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/as-everybody-knows-no-one-with-red-hair\">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids\">South Park</a>. One of my nicknames is \"daywalker\" though I do have the pale skin and very light freckles.  But I'm pretty sure non-redheads just can't tell gingers apart.<br />I thought about saying \"Spoilers\" here but since I'm talking about a book of ghost stories, if the fact that ghosts are present surprises you, well, here's your spoiler alert.

I love Halloween so I actually think I might be able to make it to 10 this week but let's not get ahead of ourselves.<br /><ol><li>Everything's Eventual by Stephen King This is a book of King's short stories and it has some of my favorite King stories, including my favorite short story \"1408\".  This story sincerely creeped me out and I immediately started it again.  It's not only unsettling but a truly great tale.  I wrote posts about \"<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/it-was-human-minds-final-great-parlor\">1408</a>\" and another great story from the collection <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/nine-year-old-boy-i-was-had-done\">\"The Man in the Black Suit\"</a>. </li><li>The Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark collection by Alan Schwartz and illustrated by Stephen Gammell I loved these books when I was little but at the same time they gave me nightmares.  I'm pretty sure the illustrations were responsible for that.  Even now those drawings are pretty terrifying. </li><li>Misery<span> by Stephen King<span> King might come up a few more times on the list, so heads up.  This is one of the few King novels I've read that doesn't include the supernatural and I think that makes it that much more terrifying.  There are no ghosts or monsters, just a psychotic paranoid number one fan.</span></span></li><li>Jaws by Peter Benchley My favorite book when I was little was The Golden Book of Sharks and Whales. And then many years later I read Jaws and a few other \"terrors of the deep\" books and no matter how many times Shark Week tries to tell me otherwise, I am terrified of deep water and things in the water attacking me.  I have trouble playing video game underwater levels (Damn you, BanjoKazooie).</li><li>Dracula<span> by Bram Stoker<span> I took a Horror Fiction class in college and this was the basis we used for horror stories to come later.  It has some slow moments but it's the original and does have some great scenes.</span></span></li><li>\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" by Edgar Allen Poe The fact that the story is told from the PoV of the crazy narrator makes this story that much better.  You're made an accomplice to his crime but you never really understand his motivation.  You're with him and yet apart from him and there's something in that contradiction that makes the story so eerie.</li><li>American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis I love this movie so I read the book.  The movie is child's play compared to the novel, which is incredibly graphic.  Incredibly graphic. Rats get shoved places rats should not go.  But the movie is still one of my favorites so it stays on the list. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the book. Also if you really, really like the book, no matter what you say, I will think you have latent serial killer tendencies. Update! I found this list of <a href=\"http://librarysciencedegree.org/the-50-most-hated-characters-in-literary-history/\">50 most hated literary characters </a>and Patrick Bateman, the main character, is listed.  Here's what they have to say: \"Only the most twisted of individuals would admire Patrick Bateman, a slick, priviledged executive who enjoys murder, rape, cannibalism, torture, necrophilia and other wholesome activities.\"</li><li>World War Z by Max Brooks. I actually plan on re-reading this in the near future so be on the lookout for those posts but I'll tell you that while awake I'm not afraid of zombies but apparently my subconscious is terrified of them.  Every night while I was reading this book I dreamt of zombies and they were some strange dreams</li></ol>And 2 horror stories I want to read but haven't yet...<br />9. Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson I've had this book for years but still haven't gotten around to reading it.  I will, eventually.  I love the idea of a pure evil character as part of all of us. 10. The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson I almost included \"The Lottery\" on this list but I decided to save the spot for this Jackson novel.  I've heard time and again that this is a horror must read.<br />Look at that, I made it to 10!  Amazing.  I even had to remove some book to keep it at 10.  I knew this had to happen eventually.  Just don't expect it to happen again in the near future.

I assumed it would be a non-stop thrill ride.  I can't tell if the story was over-hyped and if I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't have these raised expectations.  The story was slower than I expected it to be and I never got to the point where I had to read \"just one more page\".  To be honest, I never really cared about the whole </span></span></span><span><span>Wennerstr\u00f6m plot and I found Blomkvist to be boring.  I thought Salander was the most interesting character and unfortunately the story didn't stick with her for long enough.  The title leads you to believe that Salander will a more prominent character than she is and I can't decide if the new title is false advertising. </span></span><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>I wrote the </span><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/boston-book-festival-full-frontal\"><span>other day</span></a><span> how I understood the original title of the book was </span><span>Men Who Hate Women</span><span>.  The rape against Salander is violent and in my opinion unnecessary to her character development.  I don't think we learn too much more about her after this scene, other than she's capable of violence.  Violence I was totally behind because, well, I can only be so sympathetic to a rapist, but violence nonetheless.  I guess I see where Larsson was going with this scene, given the violence against other women described later in the book.  It isn't just a crazed serial killer that attacks women, it happens elsewhere.  But the rape is so violent that it isn't really making a statement about the general atmosphere of condoned violence against women, it's just another sadistic exaggeration.  That's not to say it doesn't happen, but it's not the norm and the extreme violence just makes the act all that much less believable.  </span></span><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>I'm going to read the next book in the series, because it's the next book for book club.  I hope that Salander plays a larger part in that book.  If she doesn't I don't think I would bother reading The Girl Who Played with Fire.  I guess that's s a compliment of the character Larsson did create.  The book may have a lot of violence against women, but the female characters are far more interesting and more well developed than the male ones.  </span></span><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>Overall I wouldn't really recommend the book.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't for me.  With the exception of the Salander scenes, which I did enjoy, I would have been fine putting the book down at any point and walking away from it.  </span></span><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span><span>Title quote from page 552.</span></span></span><br />Larsson, Stieg.

Part of this probably stems from the \"I wish I could make magic\" desire, even though I'd waste it on things like getting me food from the kitchen without having to get up.  I also have a bit of a crush on Gary Oldman (loved him in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead) so the movies helped with that.  He's impulsive and reckless but fairly well-adjusted considering crazy family growing up and then he was in torture prison for 13 years.  I think I've already set an odd tone for this list...</li><li>Sodapop Curtis from The Outsiders.  This is an old crush, since I read the book when I was in 7th grade and I mostly picture a 1983-era Rob Lowe in this role.  I know he is hardly in the book but HIS NAME IS SODAPOP.  Really, that's all it takes. </li><li>Thursday Next from the Thursday Next series.  I have a bit of a girl crush on Thursday.  This is one of my favorite book series and she is such a strong and quick-witted character.  What's not to love?</li><li>Detective Inspector Jack Spratt from the Nursery Crime series.

I know, exciting.  I've mentioned before that he's one of <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/book-blogger-hop-ii\">my favorite authors</a> and one of my go-to's if I want a quick read that I know I'll like. Earlier in the Spring I heard he had a new book coming out soon but it wasn't out just yet.  At Home is available now, though like Fforde's Shades of Grey I'm waiting for it to come out in paperback.  Bryson read a couple excerpts out of the book and talked about how little we know about the little things that are all around us.  Why is it \"room &amp; board\", why is it salt &amp; pepper that are always on the table?<br /><br />I know Bryson is originally from Des Moines, Iowa and that he's lived in England for years but his accent still through me.  It's a mix of the two of them but after years of reading his book and not hearing what he sounds like I guess I made up my own version of what he sounds like.  He is a riot and he writes like he talks.  I was starving during the talk so roommate and I got linner instead of waiting around for book signing.  As I said I'd prefer the paperback version and while I like autographed copies of books I decided I didn't want to buy a hardback version and fight the crazy line while my stomach was crying for a sandwich.  But overall fun, windy times at the Boston Book Festival!<br /><br />Update!: Both Brother and CurlyGeek04 pointed out that Bryson was on The Colbert Report so I found it on OnDemand.  If you're a fan of Bryson, or want to be, check this out.  It's pretty fantastic<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Full+Frontal+Feminism+cover.jpg\" />Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters by Jessica Valenti<br />I first heard of the book on <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/09/annas-review-of-full-frontal-feminism.html\">The Broke and the Bookish blog</a>, so this is the second case where I read a book I heard about on a book blog.  (The first book was <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/shouldnt-you-be-home-sitting-sheba\">This Is Where I Leave You</a> by <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/what-i-know-about-sitting-shiva\">Jonathan Tropper</a>.) I was going to use the quote \"Keepers of the all-powerful hymen\" (86) as the title of this post but because this is about more than just FFF so I went with my planned subtitle.  I laughed out loud when I read the quote, which was a little awkward seeing how I was sitting in a Texas airport at the time.  I read in public often so you'd think I'd be used to this by now but I still end up laughing and then fake-coughing.  It's pathetic, I know.  I was already getting odd looks from the guy across from me when he saw the cover so who know what he was thinking when I started laughing. <br /><br />Anyway, this book is wonderful and I want to share it with everyone.  Feminism gets a bad rap when, as a past professor explained it, it really just means equality between the sexes.  It doesn't mean anger or that men are awful.  It's things that most people seem to agree with but the backlash against feminism prevents people from self-identifying as such. Valenti addresses stereotypes as well as problems within the feminist movement, goes into topics such as women in politics, beauty and media, reproductive rights and the \"rape schedule\".  There's nothing completely new and groundbreaking but the book serves as a wake-up call that things are better than they were but they aren't fixed and there is still more to do.  I want to reiterate that everyone, especially young women, should pick up this book. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Girl+w+Dragon+Tattoo+cover.jpg\" />My initial thoughts on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson<br />gThere may be some spoilers.  Not about the mystery in general but I will discuss certain plot points. So if you don't want to know them, I'll see ya next time! I'm on page 332, version details below<br />I understand why the original title was Men Who Hate Women. That is a theme throughout obviously the Lisbeth Salander's encounters with her new guardian and even the stories of marriage in the Vanger family.  Parts 2 and 3 include statistics such as \"Forty-six percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man\" (139) and \"Thirteen percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship\" (299).  And I don't like rape scenes.  I can deal with ridiculous violence; I read American Psycho and while I disgusted by a lot of it (like the rat) I didn't want to throw the book down at any point.  But I don't like rape scenes, violent or otherwise.  On top of that I, so far anyway, don't care about the mystery.  I don't feel like the character of Mikael Blomkvist is well developed and I don't actually care about the mysterious disappearance of a women over forty years prior to the story.  I heard the story is slow in the first 100-150 pages, but that it really picks up after that.

You may be asking yourself \"But Alley, you live in Boston and they're coming to your town tonight.  No need to make the trip all the way to NYC\" to which I respond \"Not only are you correct but I originally had tickets for the show right here in Boston.  And chose to go to the NYC show instead.\"  Not to go into details but the decision was made based on work schedules for myself and Boyfriend as well as a healthy dose of insanity.  I only went down for the night and I actually checked into my return flight to Boston while I was still in Boston.  Fun how that works out. So my tiredness is due to not sleeping much last night after the show and having to get up bright and early today to make it back to Boston.  And probably some stress because for a good hour Boyfriend and I didn't think we'd make it to the show due to traffic.  As it was we missed the first 30-45 minutes and were almost ready to throw in the towel but A) that was a lot of travel and B) we already had the tickets.  Even one song is better than none.  And Boyfriend and I have seen Jimmy Eat World a stupid number of times so I already pretty much knew how things would go.  I've been a fan of the band since I was about 15 so I've had lots of time to see them perform.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/prayer%283%29.jpg\" />This is a book blog however and as much as I do just want to gush about how much I like seeing these guys and go to stupid lengths to do so, I can keep this about books.  See, Jimmy Eat World has this song called \"Goodbye Sky Harbor\" off of their Clarity album and this song is based on the novel A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving.  Now I didn't know this when the album first came out.  I just knew this was the 16 minute song that closed off the album and that I used to fall asleep to.  It wasn't until years later when I met Boyfriend, also a Jimmy Eat World fan, that he got me the book as a gift before I went to Italy. He knew I wanted some English language books for while I was there and he knew I loved Jimmy Eat World so this seemed perfect. I enjoyed the book, although not enough that I plan on re-reading it anytime soon.<br /><br />I know plenty of people (myself included) have read books based on movies or maybe even a TV show but I believe this is the first time I've read a book based on a song.  Have any of you ever read a book because of a song you've heard?  Would you read a book if you learned a song you liked was based on it? Are there other songs about books?  I know Zeppelin had some LotR referenced songs but are there any others?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:35+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:35+00:00","published_at":"2010-10-15T16:40:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e9b5dde223867000313","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Jimmy Eat World","slug":"jimmy-eat-world","url":"/articles/tags/jimmy-eat-world"},{"value":"bookish question","slug":"bookish-question","url":"/articles/tags/bookish-question"},{"value":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","slug":"a-prayer-for-owen-meany","url":"/articles/tags/a-prayer-for-owen-meany"},{"value":"John Irving","slug":"john-irving","url":"/articles/tags/john-irving"}]}]},{"id":"53224e9c5dde223867000314","title":"Helpless lust and unreasoning anxiety were just part of growing up","slug":"helpless-lust-and-unreasoning-anxiety-were-just-part-of-growing-up","url":"/articles/helpless-lust-and-unreasoning-anxiety-were-just-part-of-growing-up","body":"Here we are at the third and final book of Butler's Lilith's Brood/Xenogenesis series.  I originally typed down that I liked this one best, but I don't know if that's the case.  The first book, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/cancer-growing-in-someones-body-will-go\">Dawn </a>is probably my favorite.  It not only provoked the most emotion from me, but I was surprised by it.  It never went the way I anticipated, I connected with Lilith more than I thought and overall it was a nice surprise.  Imago wasn't as good as Dawn but by this point I had connected with the characters and become more familiar with the alien Oankali that I found myself missing them when I finished the book.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Imago-cover.jpg\" />Just as the point of view changed in Adulthood Rites, so it changes again in Imago.  The Oankali aliens are made up of 3 sexes: male, female and ooloi, which has no sex.  Butler says ooloi does not directly translate into English but can mean: \"'Treasured stranger.' 'Bridge.' 'Life trader.' 'Weaver.' 'Magnet.'\" (526).  Males and females cannot mate without an ooloi.  When new Oankali or construct (part Oankali, part human) children are born until they mature they don't have a sex and can become any of the 3 sexes.  Normally I try to avoid plot details in reviews because really, you can read those anywhere.  In this case understanding of what ooloi is is necessary to understand the main character Jodahs, who becomes a construct ooloi.  This is the first book that takes place in the first person, although I commented in my review of Dawn that I kept forgetting that it wasn't actually from Lilith's PoV. <br /><br />The aliens in the first two novels remain completely alien.  Even in the second novel, when Akin, the Oankali male construct is the main character, they were still separate.  By having Jodahs become the main character and to put the story in his point of view in the first person I was able to connect with the characters, to understand them in a way that I wasn't able to before.  I would say my lack of empathy with Akin from Adulthood Rites is a problem with Butler's writing but it's clear that this was her intention.  I learned more of Oankali via Akin but not enough to understand their motivations, for them to not seem so alien anymore. <br /><br />I mentioned above the different translations for the word ooloi and Lilith tells Jodahs that \"magnet\" is the definition she prefers.  \"People are drawn to ooloi and can't escape...the chemical bonds of mating were as difficult to break as the habit of breathing,\" (526).  What you learn once you see the world for Jodahs point of view is the ooloi don't capture humans but are just as drawn to humans.  Ooloi literally cannot survive without their mates and something about this detail made them seem more relate-able.  Other ooloi would tell Lilith about the connection but it never seemed true.  They were always so seemingly disconnected from everything. <br /><br />I just realized I said that the ooloi would tell people about their attraction but that it didn't seem true, that it seemed like a lie.  But the Oankali do not lie.  They may not tell the truth but they don't lie.  Butler uses the Oankali to examine the human experience and I wonder if my disbelief about what the Oankali actually meant is based on my own experience is that people lie all the time and why should I believe this alien?  Even when Butler sets up the Oankali to be so completely different I still understand them based on my own experience and obviously (in case you thought I was from another planet) that is the human experience. <br /><br />I have enjoyed the Lilith's Brood trilogy and I would recommend it even if you aren't a sci fi fan.  I'm not typically.   The story is well written and doesn't expect you to be a sci fi fan to appreciate it.<br /><br />Title quote from page 649<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E. Imago. Lilith's Brood.

But I like this topic and their top ten lists always seem to generate interesting discussions so I'm going with it.  I don't think I'll make it to 10 but then again I hardly ever do so at least I'm consistent in my inconsistencies.  <br /><br />So this week's topic is the top ten books I'll never read.  I'll probably mix up actual titles and types of novels because I don't think I'll be able to come up with many of either.  I also should say that I seem to prove myself wrong a lot so never really means \"never but possibly if someone I trust strongly recommends it and they lend me a copy so I don't have to pay for it well then I might read it.\"  I would have said I'd never read the Twilight series but then I did so jokes on me.<br /><br /><ol><li>Political drivel. I've skimmed through a couple and even the ones whose point of view I agree with piss me off.  You'll not see me reading anything by Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, Al Fraken, etc or any of their ghostwriters</li><li>Romance novels.  I don't need the bodice ripping Fabio anywhere near my novels </li><li>Jodi Piccolt or Nicholas Sparks.  I know Sparks claims he's high literature and that's cute and all but no.  Manipulative melodrama?  Yes.  I'd add The Lovely Bones in this section, but I have read it for a class so unfortunately I can't put it in the \"never\" category.</li><li>Self-help books.  Unless they're sarcastic and then not really self-help.  For example, I have the book Today I Will Nourish My Inner Martyr and Other Affirmations for the Cynic. I accept self-help books like that. </li><li>Ulysses  I know I should.  Perhaps I will.  I wouldn't be surprised if I don't.  </li><li>Eat, Pray, Love and any other pretentious memoirs. I'm very happy you got a huge book advance to travel around and tell people how lost their lives are without doing the same.  Now go away.</li><li>YA Lit. This is a general \"never\" as I've already mentioned above I've read the Twilight series as well as Harry Potter.  I'm glad the genre exists for the YA crowd.  I'm just not there anymore</li><li>Anything by a Reality Star.  Snooki getting a book deal hurts my brain.</li></ol><br />Oo made it to 8 this time.

And then I realized I last posted on Thursday and it hasn't actually been that long and I don't actually need to post anything.  I closed the post and said \"Alley, no one cares.  Just post when you finish up the Imago review\" and I thought that was that.  Then I started going through my Google reader and it's currently telling me there are 361 unread posts.  Now granted, Google reader hates it when I try to unsubscribe from a blog and continues to add it back, so I'm sure a good number of those posts are ones that I really don't care about.  (If anyone knows how to get Google Reader to believe me when I say I want to unsubscribe, I'd be eternally grateful.) <br /><br />So I guess what I'm saying is I have 361 posts to go through so I feel like I need to contribute somehow.  And I want to brag about how awesome my friend's wedding was as she's the reason I've been missing and why I've had far too little sleep in the last 4 days.  I'm sure the lack of sleep is part of the reason for my post as well, as I babble more than usual when overtired.  Friend lives out in AZ so I saw Tucson for the first time ever and it is beautiful.  The heat is more than I think I'd ever be able to handle on a regular basis (I'm so pale) but this has pushed up my need to go see the Grand Canyon.  The wedding was at a dude ranch they'd rented out so it was all guests staying there and very laid back and just lots of fun.  I definitely left a sweater with her and hopefully my rain coat is there as well.  AZ may be far too hot for such clothes but coming back to Boston at 11 at night in just a t-shirt was less than fun.<br /><br />I mentioned in my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/ereader-would-come-in-handy-right-about\">previous post</a> that I couldn't decide what books to bring with me and I absolutely made the wrong choice and ended up buying a book at the airport.  BUT that also means I have 2 reviews I need to get down soon so I should have some new posts coming up soon.  I know, I know, try to contain your excitement.<br /><br />ALSO! (I get easily excited when my overtired-ness passes over into deliriousness) it's the Boston Book Festival this weekend and I totally plan to go play at that, especially when I saw Bill Bryson will be there.  Lots in store and hopefully I'll be better rested and the post will be more coherent than this.

I wrote a post asking <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/how-do-i-choose\">how can I choose</a> what books to bring with me on my move and which to go down to Long Island?  This is a similar and only slightly less dramatic question: I'm going away for the weekend and how do I choose what books to bring?  Here's my conundrum<br /><br />I have a couple long plane rides so I want a book (obviously).  I'm about 50 pages to the end of my current read,  which means I'll definitely need another book.  As you can see on my lil' bookshelf list on the left (assuming you're reading this when it's newly posted and not digging through the archives.  Pretty sure I don't need to worry about that...) I have 3 books on the list.  I'm almost done with Imago the 3rd book of the Lilith's Brood trilogy and then I have The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Full Frontal Feminism on the list.  I plan on reading GDT because it was picked for my book club.  Actually we're up to The Girl That Played with Fire , I just haven't read this one yet.  If it wasn't for book club, I don't know that I'd be reading this book. At least not right now.  The other book, FFF, I bought because I read a great review on a fellow book blog, one I promise to find and link to when I write its post.  It looks like it could be a quick read.  So do I:<br /><br />1) Bring my current read and GDT, knowing I should read it for book club?  <br />2) Bring my current read and FFF, because FFF is the book I want to read next?<br />3) Bring GDT and FFF and just leave Lilith's Brood at home because I'm so close to the end it's silly to bring it with me?<br />4) Bring all 3 books, heavy suitcase be damned. <br /><br />I know I'm asking you what I should do, but I guess I should say what would you do because I've already packed.  I went with #2 because I don't want to stop my book before finishing it and I want to read FFF and I thought it was silly to bring 3 books with me when I will be busy the majority of the weekend will likely not finish them all.  But what would you do in this situation?  Having an eReader right now would have really solved my problems.<br /><br />Update!: I should have gone with option 4.  Those in the comments were right.  I ended up buying The Corrections by Frazen at the airport on my trip back.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:37+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:37+00:00","published_at":"2010-10-07T14:31:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e9d5dde22386700031b","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"e-reader","slug":"e-reader","url":"/articles/tags/e-reader"},{"value":"packing","slug":"packing","url":"/articles/tags/packing"}]}]},{"id":"53224e9d5dde22386700031c","title":"Top Ten Favorite Authors","slug":"top-ten-favorite-authors","url":"/articles/top-ten-favorite-authors","body":"Another Tuesday, another top 10 list, hosted by the people over at <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/10/top-ten-tuesday-stephanys-top-ten.html\">The Broke and the Bookis</a>h.  This week's topic is top 10 favorite authors.  I love this topic.  I guess it's a bit obvious and I know I personally have gone on and on about a couple authors, but I'm happy to go on some more.<br /><br /><ol><li>Christopher Moore - He is a recent addition to my favorites list but he quickly jumped to the top of the list.  I had a couple friends that kept telling me to check him out and for whatever reason I just said \"yeah yeah yeah\" and didn't get around to it.  I read You Suck, not realizing it was the second in a series and I liked it but wasn't running out to find more.  Then I read Lamb and it is my favorite book.  I can't help laughing out loud while I read it.  Gets me some interesting looks in public.  So far I've written about 1 of Moore's books, Fool on this blog (<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/for-guy-that-maintains-low-profile\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/were-all-fates-bastards\">here</a>).</li><li>Jasper Fforde - Like Moore, I was introduced to Fforde by a family friend who read his book The Eyre Affair for a book club and thought I'd enjoy it.  I liked it but didn't really fall in love with his work until I read the next book in the Thursday Next series, Lost in a Good Book.  From that point I have devoured his other work.  I've read the whole of the Thursday Next series at least 5 times and I've read the 3 books in the Nursery Crime series at least 3 times.  I've been semi-patiently waiting for Shades of Grey to come out in paperback. (If you want to check out my Eyre Affair posts go <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/they-kep-eye-onovertly-free-thespian\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/my-quote-as-title-idea-is-already\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">here</a>.)</li><li>Bill Bryson - Oh look, another author I was introduced to by a friend.  I'm no good at stumbling on amazing authors on my own.  Anyway, an old roommate of mine was a big fan and I read his book Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe.  It's wonderful.  I love Bryson's sense of humor and he can make anything worth reading.  I've even read his science book A Short History of Nearly Everything a few times.  Bryson is one of my go-to authors when I can't think of something I want to read.  I've read his books a million times and I love it every time.</li><li>Shakespeare - I love Shakespeare.  I had some great high school English teachers that did an excellent job introducing me to his work and I've loved it since then.  A Midsummer Night's Dream and Othello are among my favorite of his plays.  And it's not just the plays but all of the Shakespeare related works.  The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) by the Reduced Shakespeare Company is my favorite play and I love Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.  Check out my post about <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/law-of-transitives-andothello\">Othello here.</a></li><li>Kurt Vonnegut - My dad bought me Slaughterhouse Five one year for my birthday and I loved him since.  Breakfast of Champions is my favorite of his books.  Eliot Rosewater and Kilgore Trout are my favorite characters and I love that they show up over and over again.</li></ol>Well crap.  Again I try to do this Top Ten and not only can I come up with 10 of my favorite authors but none of them are women.  It's not that I don't like female authors, it's just that I can't say any of them are my favorites. As for my favorites, I tried to come up with authors who have multiple works that I'm a big fan of.  And this is really the end of that list.  So once again, I fail the top ten.  But I'm posting it anyway because the 5 I do have are quality!<br /><ol></ol>","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:37+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:37+00:00","published_at":"2010-10-05T16:16:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e9d5dde22386700031d","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224e9d5dde22386700031e","title":"Humans persecute their different ones, yet they need them to give themselves definition and status","slug":"humans-persecute-their-different-ones-yet-they-need-them-to-give-themselves-definition-and-status","url":"/articles/humans-persecute-their-different-ones-yet-they-need-them-to-give-themselves-definition-and-status","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Adulthood+Rites+cover.jpg\" />I recently finished the second book in Butler's Lilith's Brood/Xenogenisis trilogy.  Unlike in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/cancer-growing-in-someones-body-will-go\">Dawn</a>, Adulthood Rites is told from the point of view of Lilith's male construct son Akin.<br /><br />Quick background! In the first book, Lilith and other humans are saved from an Earth that has been destroyed due to nuclear war by a group of aliens called Oankali.  The aliens saved them because they want to \"trade\" with them, meaning essentially creating a new species that is neither Oankali nor human and that will have the best features of each.  Free will and control are examined in the first book, as most of the saved humans aren't too keen on this trade.  Now back on a newly constructed Earth jungle some humans, including Lilith, have agreed to the trade and those that haven't are sterilized.<br /><br />Like in Dawn, Adulthood Rites continues to examine the morality of the Oankali's decision to end the human race.  They make the argument that human's hierarchical tendencies coupled with their intelligence means the eventual destruction of humans at their own hands is inevitable again.  Humans cannot help but want to dominate each other, the land, other animals and the Oankali believe that giving them back Earth and allowing them to continue on is cruel.  It's like allowing animals to live together, even when you know that they will, in the end, hurt each other.  And so they give the humans long life and allow them to live on Earth but they cannot reproduce without the Oankali.  Butler makes a convincing argument for the aliens to not allow humans to destroy each other again; they are acting in the people's best interest.  But of course no one wants to become obsolete, which is exactly what the Oankali are doing to the human race.<br /><br />Akin is a human construct: born to a human woman (Lilith) but has characteristics of both human and Oankali. The humans who have refused to live with the Oankali are desperate for children and these \"resister\" groups kidnap Akin and bring him back to their village Phoenix.  Akin looks mostly human but at a few months old is able to speak and comprehend complex ideas and has the cold logic displayed by the full Oankali.  He sees firsthand the destruction and violence the human resisters are capable of but he also comes to understand their frustration and anger at not being able to have their own children.  Life becomes pointless and even though they know Akin won't be able to give them what they want he represents a ray of hope.<br /><br />The story tackles the human condition and the seeming inevitability of human violence and domination.  It never suggests that humans are able of overcoming these characteristics; even the humans seem to believe in this yet they want the chance to prove the Oankali wrong.  It also examines the Oankali acting in the people's best interest, yet they remove their choices.  Lilith talks about how the Oankali treat people the way humans treated animals.  The decisions made are for their own good, even if the people don't like it as they don't.<br /><br />As I said in my review of Dawn, I'm not a huge sci fi fan and it's not really the aliens and the sci fi part that interests me with this trilogy.  I've found, even though this story is told through Akin's eyes, that I still sympathize with the human characters.  I understand why the Oankali behave as they do but I can feel the human's anger.<br /><br />One more book in the trilogy (obviously) and then I'll be moving away from sci fi for awhile but for now I am enjoying this.  I feel like this review was difficult to write, which sometimes happens if I didn't really care about the book but honestly, I had trouble putting this down.  It slowed for me in the end but I went through this much quicker than I expected.  I hope Imago holds my interest in the same way.<br /><br />Title quote form page 329.<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E.

Yet the world-at-large got in the way so while I can see the end coming up I haven't yet reached it.  I thought that meant I'd just skip the post this week and move on but I do have something I want to write about.  The other day my dad sent me a piece from The New Yorker written by John Updike in 1960 about Ted Williams last game at Fenway Park titled <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1960/10/22/1960_10_22_109_TNY_CARDS_000266305\">\"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\"</a>.  (That was a flurry of prepositions for you.) <br /><br />I'm not exactly sure how/why Dad found this story (a question I should probably ask him) but when he read it he said he thought of me.  Now, I wouldn't call myself a sports fan.  I know of them, I've been to many baseball and hockey games but honestly, I couldn't tell you any highlights from the game and sometimes I'm not even 100% sure who won.  But both Dad and Boyfriend are huge sports fans, hence the reason I have been to so many games.  But the sports aspect wasn't why he thought of me.  Part of it was because it is about Fenway Park and because I live in Boston and have been to several Red Sox games he thought I'd be interested to hear what Fenway was like back then.  But more than that he sent me the story because Updike wrote it and he thought I'd enjoy that, regardless of what the topic might be. My dad has selected enough winners (Catch-22, Slaughterhouse 5 and I swear I'll pick up The World According to Garp soon) that at this point if he suggests I should read something, I read it.<br /><br />I've never read anything by John Updike before, so if anyone has any recommendations please throw them my way.  Actually, I constantly mix up John Updike and Upton Sinclair.  It's the \"up\" in the name.  One day I decided they were the same and each time I hear either name I have to think \"Is that the meatpacking rat guy or the other one?\"  Please help me fix that problem.  But for now, onto the essay.<br /><br />I love Updike's prose.  As I mentioned, I don't really care about sports but his writing pulled me through it, made me want to keep reading and made me sad when it was over as I thought \"Why haven't I read anything by him before?\"  As Dad described it: \"Updike is a wonderful observer of people &amp; his surroundings and his prose is always smart and expressive.\"  I couldn't have said it better.  The prose isn't always easy but it's lyrical and written in such a way that you can feel Updike thought about each word he selected.  Nothing is accidental and simple (not easy) words carry a powerful description.  Yes, it helps to know your Greek myth referencesg in order to understand how Williams is like Achilles, but don't avoid this piece even if you don't know your Achilles from your Agamemnon.  Not particularly caring about baseball hasn't stopped me from enjoying it! <br /><br />Again, thank you Dad for buying me that book of Greek mythology when I was little.  As you said, if you want to understand Western literature you need to understand Greek myths and the Bible.  Why you thought a 8 year old would get that or care, I don't know but it seems to have worked so bravo!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:38+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:38+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-30T16:43:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224e9e5dde22fdcf000576","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"John Updike","slug":"john-updike","url":"/articles/tags/john-updike"},{"value":"The New Yorker","slug":"the-new-yorker","url":"/articles/tags/the-new-yorker"},{"value":"Fenway","slug":"fenway","url":"/articles/tags/fenway"}]}]},{"id":"53224e9f5dde2223b600018c","title":"Top Ten Literary Couples and Fellow Bloggers","slug":"top-ten-literary-couples-and-fellow-bloggers","url":"/articles/top-ten-literary-couples-and-fellow-bloggers","body":"The good people over at <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/09/top-ten-favorite-fictional-couples-in.html\">The Broke and the Bookish</a> have a weekly top ten meme and this week's topic is Top Ten Favorite Fictional Couples.<br /><ol><li>Beatrice and Benedick from Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare.  I love these two.  They're quick witted, they're sarcastic, and they are far more interesting than Hero and Claudio.  </li><li>Mr. Darcy and Lizzie Bennet from Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by  Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith. I would have said these to from P&amp;P but since I haven't actually read that one yet (I know I know, I'll get to it!  Promises) I went with the version I have read.  And besides, the relationship has the same dynamic, there are just more ninja/zombie fight scenes.  </li><li>Hermoine and Ron from the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. Hmm, another couple I love that bickers all the time.  I'm seeing a theme emerging.  I wonder what Boyfriend's take on this is.  Anyway, I love not only do these two already have the old-married-couple-constantly-bickering down pat, but they are both so different they make such great sense together.  </li><li>Thursday Next and Landen Park-Laine from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde. See here's a couple that actually likes one another. Alright, maybe it wasn't so simple in the first book but the conflicting emotions come from a deeper place than the cliche of they-hate-each-other-but-really-love-one-another.  Don't get me wrong, I love that cliche (see examples above) but it is nice to see a change.</li><li>Bottom and Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare. I know they're not really a couple or not a happy-ever-after couple but I love these two.  And really their love is no more or less real than what the fairies leave Helena and Demetrius with.  While we're at it</li><li>Helena and Demetrius from A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare.  OK so as I just said above, these two are only together because some fairies squeezed \"the aphroditic juice of a hermaphroditic flower\" into Demetrius' eye (thank you Complete Works Abridged) but I get a kick out of Helena's awful character and really the scene of Helena chasing him around the forest is great.</li><li>Biff and Joshua (Jesus) from Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore. Not a romantic couple sure but a couple nonetheless.  Biblical bromance?  (My blog is going to get burned at the stake now, isn't it?)</li></ol>I'm having trouble coming up with more and don't want to force this so I'll stop there.  There are a lot of couples on that list that have fairly contentious relationships.  I wonder what that says about me... <br /><br />I have been totally slacking on my fellow bloggers post and I want to fix that.  I've found so many fantastic blogs so here's one more you should check out cos she rocks:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musings</a> - I've been following Brenna over at Literary Musings for awhile now and I don't know why it's taken me so long to bring her up here.

Butler</a>.  I originally had to read Dawn for a college class: Gender, Sex and the Rhetoric of Science.  It was a great class but it involved a lot of strange books to read and this is up there.  I think the quote on the back of the book sums this up nicely, at least the first book:<br /><blockquote>Lilith's Brood is a profoundly evocative, sensual - and disturbing - epic of human transformation.</blockquote>\"Evocative\", \"sensual\", and \"disturbing\" are 3 very good words to describe this book. It's not a traditional sci fi book, according to my very limited understanding of sci fi.  OK, I guess according to my limited stereotype of sci fi.  There are aliens involved and, again this is based on my sci fi generalizations, while they are main characters, they are consistently a source of disgust for the main character Lilith.  There is none of the sense of camaraderie between Lilith and the Oankali that you might fight in something like Star Wars. Everything is so literally alien that Lilith can never completely trust Jdahya (if you know the pronunciation for that, please feel free to add it in the comments. In my head I pretty much just call him \"Jad\"), any of the other aliens she lives with or the living ship they're on.<br /><br />The books is written in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_person_limited\">third person limited</a> and I keep finding myself repeatedly surprised to find that the story isn't in the first person.  Not that I think stylistically it would be better in the first person, but rather I'll read something that says \"she said\" and I'll have to go back and re-read before I remember that Lilith, the main character is the \"she\" and there is no I.  I'd say this is just the case with the style, but I never noticed it with other works, such as Harry Potter (the Wikipedia entry may have pointed out that's written in the same  narrative mode).  You end up empathizing with Lilith so completely probably because Butler has made the aliens so incredibly, well, alien. This style connects you to Lilith without actually letting you as close to her as a first person narrative would do.<br /><br />I've obviously mentioned a number of times already that aliens play a big part of this book, but I want to again stress this doesn't feel like a typical sci fi book.  There isn't really (so far or in what I remember) much action.  Thus far the book is really an examination of free will or rather the removal of it.  The Oankali want Lilith to learn about them and they want to learn about her but they do keep her ignorant of their actions.  They keep her a prisoner, though a prisoner in nice conditions.  The book opens while Lilith is in isolation and Bulter is such a talented author that within a few pages you really feel Lilith's pain and fear.<br /><br />The book is split into 4 parts: Womb, Family, Nursery and The Training Floor.  The first two sections deal with Lilith learning about and coming to terms with the Oankali and the second two sections deal with Lilith teaching other humans about the aliens and how to survive in the jungle.  I found I was more interested in the first two sections and wished these parts were longer.  There's more action in the latter sections but I liked the tension and learning about the aliens and the ship with Lilith.  Because I related to her in the first sections I found myself frustrated with the other Awakened humans when they wouldn't just play nice.  Obviously this would have made a much less interesting book but I felt Lilith's frustration and hopelessness.  <br /><br />When I began reading the book I had only planned on reading Dawn.  The book went by so quickly and I'm not ready to be done so I'm going to continue on Lilith's journal and start reading Adulthood Rites the next part of the trilogy.  I've read the first few pages before, right after I finished Dawn the last time, but books for class got in the way of me finishing it.  At least I'm hoping that's why I never finished it and not because it was so bad I blocked it from memory.  I suppose I'll find out soon.<br /><br />Title quote from page 39<br /><br />Butler, Octavia E. Dawn. Lilith's Brood.

I loved this topic and I was impressed by how many people keep track of their favorite quotes.  I do not do this, though I wish I did.  I know I won't start though.  I'm never reading near a notebook or something where I can stop and write down quotes.  And I don't like writing in my books, so I won't have the option to go back later.  Hell, as it stands for this blog I just have to try to remember the quote I want to use for the title of a post, or else just happen to be near a computer at the time.  So because I'm not nearly as organized as so many of you (and partially because I'm jealous of your organizational skills) I did not partake.  I know any quotes I come up with will just be ones I was able to find at that moment and because I wouldn't even be near my bookshelf, it would mostly be me trying to find posts online.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/shakespeare.jpg\" />I was disappointed but then I realized something: I'm a bit of a Shakespeare nerd and I can probably remember lots of Shakespeare quotes.  Hell, had I thought of this when I was near it, I own an entire book of just Shakespeare quotes.  So I know I'm late but here are my top 10 favorite Shakespeare quotes in no particular order, other than the order I remembered them in<br /><br />1. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow<br />Creeps in this petty place from day to day,<br />To the last syllable of recorded time;<br />And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />The way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle!<br />Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />Who struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br />And then is heard no more.  It is a tale<br />Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />Signifying nothing.<br />Macbeth V.v.19-28<br /><br />2. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals -- and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me<br />Hamlet II.ii.303-312<br /><br />3. Demetrius: Villain, what hast thou done?<br />Aaron: That which thou canst not undo.<br />Demetrius: Thou hast undone our mother.<br />Aaron: Villain, I have done they mother.<br />Titus Andronicus IV.ii<br />(Right after this line I just hear \"Oh snap!\")<br /><br />4. The course of true love never did run smooth.<br />A Midsummer Night's Dream I.i.134<br /><br />5. Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br />Admit impediment. Love is not love<br />Which alters when it alteration finds,<br />Sonnet 116<br /><br />6. Reason and love keep little company together now-a-days<br />A Midsummer Night's Dream. III.i<br /><br />7. Put money in thy purse<br />Othello. I.iii.338, 339-340, 341<br />(I'm presenting most of these without explanation since for the most part I don't think they require it.  This is a fairly vague quote and, if you aren't familiar with the play, you may not recognize it or understand the situation surrounding it.  Iago is one of my favorite characters and I love his <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/law-of-transitives-andothello\">powers of manipulation</a>.)<br /><br />8. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em<br />Twelfth Night. II.iv.145-146 <br /><br />9. If music be the food of love, play on<br />Twelfth Night. I.i.1<br /><br />10. To thine own self be true<br />Hamlet I.i.78<br /><br />So I know that reads a bit like Bartlet's famous quotes (which is actually the book I own, though it's somewhere in Long Island at this moment) but really the well known quotes are well known because they're so great.  Besides I don't want to go all hipster and start listing out more obscure quotes to make myself seem pretentious.  \"Oh you hadn't heard that quote before?  Yeah, it's still pretty underground.  You gotta be really tuned in to get it.\" ","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:40+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:40+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-22T14:08:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea05dde223867000321","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Shakespeare","slug":"shakespeare","url":"/articles/tags/shakespeare"},{"value":"Tuesday Top Ten","slug":"tuesday-top-ten","url":"/articles/tags/tuesday-top-ten"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea05dde223867000322","title":"But it was a fine and exciting Ladies' Mile, doped-up baby or not","slug":"but-it-was-a-fine-and-exciting-ladies-mile-doped-up-baby-or-not","url":"/articles/but-it-was-a-fine-and-exciting-ladies-mile-doped-up-baby-or-not","body":"As soon as I read that quote I wrote it down for this post.

I mentioned in <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/only-possible-way-you-can-do-this-is-to\">my previous post</a> that I've read this before so you can be sure I do enjoy this book.  It has a great mystery of a letter referencing \"the Destruction by Fire of the entire World\" (317) and what some odd tombstone markings mean.  Even though I have read the book I couldn't remember the details so it was fun to try to solve the mystery a second time around.  Finney manages to tell a convincing story of what life was like in 1880s New York and the book includes pictures and sketches from the time to help give the reader a good idea of the styles of the time.  <br /><br />I've found with most of my reviews I write about the things I loved about the book, which makes sense since I like all of the books I've read since beginning this blog but it gets a bit redundant to keep repeating gushing reviews.  Keeping this in mind, I wanted to point out a couple problems I had with the novel.<br /><br />The book feels uneven.  Part of the time the book reads like a travelogue, with Simon just describing 1882 NYC from a 1970s point of view.  Then there's some of the sci fi aspect, with a government agency funding a program to just see if people can go back in time by, well, thinking really hard that they can and then a pretty simple story of Simon observing a letter being delivered.  These 2 parts are a little odd but do work together somewhat, but then suddenly the story takes this dramatic turn to an action and thriller tale. It just happens suddenly and goes on for so long that it feels like it's actually part of a different book.  <br /><br />Simon isn't a very sympathetic character, in my mind anyway and the problem is I think he's supposed to be.  He's not the anti-hero that's so popular now so I think Finney just didn't create a great main character. The supporting characters, Rube, Julia, Pickering, are all fantastic.  And Pickering certainly isn't likable but he's at least fun to watch.  Simon is arrogant and a bit sexist but it's like Finney didn't realize he'd made him that way.<br /><br />Here's one other small problem I have with the book, though really I suppose it's a problem with the author.  Finney has Simon bemoan how awful the world is nowadays (well the 1970s) and how wonderful and amazing it was in the 1880s.  I hate this Golden Days nostalgia, the idea that everything was so much better, simpler, happier, blah blah blah back way back when.  The selective memory that leaves out the negative aspects of the past or that forgets the awesome things about today just annoy me.  Eventually Simon does realize that the people of 1882 did have a very hard time and things weren't all sleigh rides and singing around the piano, but he stills sees 1882 as a much better time: \"Life [in 1882 New York] still had meaning and purpose in people's minds; the great emptiness hadn't begun\" (379). <br /><br />Overall this isn't my favorite book and I don't know that I'll be checking out much more of Finney's work, but I did like this book enough to read it twice.  Overall the good outweighs the bad, but the bad is still noticeable. <br /><br />Title quote from page 184<br /><br />Finney, Jack.  Time and Again.

I missed the hop last week due to lots of travel but I'm around this weekend and ready to find some new blogs.  So this week's question is: In honor of Book Blogger Appreciation Week, let's take time this week to honor our favorite book bloggers and why we love them!<br /><br />I actually started a post about this the other day so this hop seems like the perfect reason to post it.  That and it means I've pretty much already answered it, so less work for me!  Below are some blogs I love checking out, though this is far from an extensive list.  I will get back into the habit of following up the Hop with a list of blogs I love to read but if you'd like to see my previous entries about other bloggers you should read check out my posts <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/fellow-book-bloggers\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/bloggers-you-should-know\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/check-out-these-bloggers\">here</a>.   And now onto some other bloggers:<br /><br />When I first started blogging I saw all of these book blogs getting these snazzy awards.  Anytime I saw someone get it I would scan their list of blogs to see if I was one of them.  When I finally was I did a little happy dance.  I know that these awards are pretty much chain letters: you don't have to do anything special to win, other than to be awesome in one of your reader's eyes. I still get this little blogger high when I see an award but I have been failing in terms of thanking people on my blog.  I want everyone to know how thankful I am for the awards so I wanted to do that here!  This list will hopefully also give some of my other readers some other amazing blogs to check out.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.bookquotes-bookquotes.blogspot.com/\">A Thousand Books with Quotes</a> - This is great collection of quotes from books.  I love that this isn't the typical book review blog and I always enjoy checking it out.  You find great quotes and new books to check out.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://myreadersblock.blogspot.com/\">My Reader's Block</a> - She participates in some fun memes (read: ones I actually enjoy reading instead of ones I sigh and skip over) and her reviews of mostly mystery books give me a whole new genre of books to look for!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://sarahreadstoomuch.blogspot.com/\">Sarah Reads Too Much</a> - Sarah reviews some books I wouldn't normally pick up but her descriptions make the book sound like something I would enjoy.  I've added The Nanny Diaries to my unofficial TBR list.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://fartooimportantblog.blogspot.com/\">The Far Too Important Blog</a> - Geophrie's blog covers a little bit of everything.  At least a little bit of everything that I like to read about.  The book reviews are fun and I love the Project Runway recaps and the post about how bachelorette parties need to get out of the gay bars.  Wonderful funny stuff!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/\">The Book Stop</a> - CurleyGeek mentioned me as part of the Blogger Appreciation week and I was so flattered I sent Boyfriend to read the post so he could see people do seem to like my ramblings. (Not that he didn't believe me but he made me blog so he wanted some credit.)  Her reviews are very thought provoking and she opens up intelligent conversation.  It's always a treat when I see she has a new post.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:40+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:40+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-17T12:59:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea05dde223867000325","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Book Blogger Hop","slug":"book-blogger-hop","url":"/articles/tags/book-blogger-hop"},{"value":"fellow bloggers","slug":"fellow-bloggers","url":"/articles/tags/fellow-bloggers"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea15dde2223b600018e","title":"The only possible way you can do this is to just go ahead and do it.","slug":"the-only-possible-way-you-can-do-this-is-to-just-go-ahead-and-do-it","url":"/articles/the-only-possible-way-you-can-do-this-is-to-just-go-ahead-and-do-it","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Dakota.jpg\" />If money was no object and I could live anywhere in the world I would live in the Dakota.  I love New York City.  I love that there's always something going on, always something to see and do, a million places to eat (I love food) and I can't imagine getting tired of it.  One of my favorite places to be on a nice day is Central Park.  It's exactly how I like my nature: surrounded by buildings.  <br /><br />So if any of my readers currently live in the Dakota and are thinking \"I could use a change of scene but I want to keep paying for this place\" then I have a deal for you.  I will live in your awesome apartment for you!  I know, I'm a saint.  All you have to do is continue to pay the rent/mortgage/property taxes because there is no way I can afford any of this. Park facing preferred, serious inquiries only, kthxbai.  <br /><br />Boyfriend and I have been torturing ourselves watching the <a href=\"http://www.hgtv.com/selling-new-york/show/index.html\">Selling New York</a> show because we're slightly masochistic.  They haven't done an episode at the Dakota (yet!) but the gorgeous apartments did make me think of Jack Finney's Time and Again.  Boyfriend made me read this originally.  I made a comment about going to the bookstore because I needed a new book to read and he apparently took this as a threat and started digging through his things to find a book that would keep me from adding to our growing library.  I was suspicious of his selection, but I gave it a try.  Every once in awhile Boyfriend apparently knows what he's talking about and I enjoyed the book.  I even enjoyed it enough to read it a second time.  Granted this is partly motivated by a lack of new books and the fact that moving is expensive so I'm trying to save my funds.  (I can't afford new books and I want to live in the Dakota. Come on lotto!) <br /><br />Time and Again is a secret science fiction book.  I didn't know what to expect when I picked it up, but time travel was out of left field.  Boyfriend isn't really a scifi fan and the cover of the book doesn't suggest anything other than a period piece.  But I like the unexpected showing up in my books and that certainly happened here. Or maybe the time travel is all in Si's head and he's really just a crazy person stumbling around NYC thinking it's 1882.  I don't actually remember the details of the book all that well, which is nice because that means I'm enjoying knowing the book without actually remembering how things turn out.  I already know I like it, even if I can't remember why.<br /><br />It seems I've said a lot here without actually saying anything.  The talents of a (former) English major.  I'll have more about the actual book in another post, once I read some more of the actual book.<br /><br />Title quote from page 13<br /><br />Finney, Jack.  Time and Again.

He's a man of few words, but at least he doesn't waste his time on boring speech.  (I on the other hand, as evidence by this blog,  can ramble for days.)  In a brief departure from all things literature I wanted to share a quick conversation Brother and I hadg.  It has to do with the alphabet so it's every-so-slightly book related.  And it's my blog so whatever.<br /><br />Brother: Alphabets are hard to learn.<br />Red: Like ABCD?<br />Brother: Like that, but in Japanese.<br />Red: I didn't realize they actually had an alphabet.<br />Brother: They have 2 alphabets in essence.  One is used for inherent Japanese words, and one used for borrowed words. Both of which are longer than our standard alphabet, and that's not even getting into the Kanji.<br />Red: Why are you learning the Japanese alphabet?<br />Brother: Cause I'm taking Japanese<br />Red: orly?<br />Brother: It's my elective.<br />Red: So you decided to pick a super hard elective on top of all your engineering stuff?<br />Brother: Well the alphabet will be the only real challenge.<br />Red: So you have to learn 3 alphabets?<br />Brother: Pretty much.<br />Red: You should have taken Italian: 1 alphabet that doesn't even have all of our letters. Screw J,K,W,X,Y.<br />Brother: They are the outcasts of the English alphabet anyway.  I don't know how Z and Q squeeked by though.<br />Red: They needed \"pizza\". Q is suspect though.  I think it hid behind R.  They like to roll their R's so Q just hid behind it.<br />Brother: I think Q pulled something dirty to switch with K.<br />Red: Ah, totally! \"Taqe that K!\" <br /><br />The convo is edited a bit, not to add in any witty remarks that were thought of after the fact or to change the language, but to eliminate some of the back and forth that happened in between. I also added things like punctuation and capitalization. Brother and I are  both lazy and leave these out of IM talk but it's easier to go back and re-read the stuff when it's there.<br /><br />I use stupid internet slang with certain people.  Don't judge me.  Also notice that in IMs I use internet slang like \"orly\" and Brother says things like \"in essence\" and \"inherent Japanese words\" in normal conversation.  Even though I have the English degree I shouldn't be too surprised he's beating me in one of our Words Free games.

It was hard to get through the end.  Every page has another heart wrenching situation for the characters deal with but it never feels melodramatic, it never feels forced.  I was worried the book would go down that road.  I suppose anytime I see \"New York Times #1 Bestseller\" plastered on the front of a book I get a little nervous the book will be manipulative of the characters and ultimately of the reader.  It's an unfair preconception on my part, I know, and at some point perhaps I'll work on it.  I did take a class in college called The Modern Bestseller and it mostly confirmed those beliefs.  Luckily for me I heard enough reviews from other bloggers that I was willing to give the book a try.  That and I didn't know about it's NYT Bestseller status until I already decided to buy it.<br /><br />I mentioned the book is especially heart wrenching at the end and of course this isn't too surprising for a story about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany.  The blows little Liesel has to take, one right after the other, are devastating for her and it was difficult for me to read this book in public.  The reader is warned about the horrors that are coming before they actually take place because the narrator Death keeps telling you what's going to happen, before he gets back to telling the story.  Rather than ruining the ending this just serves to build the tension.  I ended up on the edge of my seat wondering if this was the moment Death was referring to earlier.  I don't know that I necessarily liked this technique because I spent so much time waiting for the other shoe to drop that I'm sure I missed important points.<br /><br />The next parts will contain some spoilers so heads up.<br /><br />There were 2 deaths Death said on multiple occasions were coming and while I may have missed other subtle points waiting for it to happen, this did not make the deaths any less powerful.  When Liesel sees the LSE carrying Rudy's body I was devastated.  I had to take many breaks while reading the scene of her kissing Rudy while the LSE tried to remove the bodies and get Liesel to safety.  The whole block was destroyed and there is so much pain to take in but the fact that Liesel essentially breaks down at this moment is hard to read.<br /><br />The second part I guess wasn't the direct death that was so painful but instead it was the imminent pain and suffering that was about to happen.  Liesel and the others are watching Nazi soldiers lead a group of Jews through the town on the way to a death camp and Liesel is searching for Max, the Jew her family had sheltered.  When she finds him she runs into the crowd and stands with him.  It's not the violence of the scene but that there is this pocket of love within so much hatred that is so touching.  both Liesel and Max knew that the consequences would be harsh for this behavior and yet it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Thank you to the bloggers that recommended this book in your own reviews.  I won't be adding this my pile of books that I read over and over again but I was pleasantly surprised to so enjoy the book.<br /><br />Title quote from page 491","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:42+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:42+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-12T13:34:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea25dde22fdcf00057a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Markus Zusak","slug":"markus-zusak","url":"/articles/tags/markus-zusak"},{"value":"The Book Thief","slug":"the-book-thief","url":"/articles/tags/the-book-thief"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea35dde2223b6000190","title":"Lack-of-reading excuse","slug":"lack-of-reading-excuse","url":"/articles/lack-of-reading-excuse","body":"I feel like I've been slacking on my next Book Thief post but that's because I've been totally slacking on my reading.

I'll hear something or see something and it will remind me of something that seems to exist in an entirely different realm.  I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

Among the choice selections here is \"California Love\" by Dr. Dre and Tupac.  Now I am not a fan of rap, however Tupac holds a special place in my heart.  Many an afternoon in high school was spent sitting in my friend's basement playing Golden Eye and listening to the All Eyez On Me album. (Ah, the suburbs.)  I won't say I'm a fan of Tupac; it's more of a Stockholm Syndrome but with music because I had to listen to it so often.  <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/iliad.jpg\" />Anyway, I'm listening to \"California Love\" and I get to the end of the song where they are just naming different cities in California (\"Inglewood always up to no good\"). I'm not from California so it did nothing for me personally, but I imagine people getting excited when they hear their hometown.  This is where that odd connection comes in: right after I thought about how I didn't really care about the cities listed but someone must I thought of The Iliad.  There's a long scene in The Iliad where Homer just names all of these different Greek city-states.  (I'm not going to include examples because 1) I'm lazy and 2) I don't have the book in front of me and an internet search is taking more than 4 seconds to get me what I want so I quit.  Tenacity is clearly not a trait of mine.)  When I last read The Iliad in college I remember the professor explaining this long, boring and essentially narratively-pointless part of the story as being a matter of pride for people listening to the tale.  Just as those imaginary club goers in my head get excited when they hear their town called out in \"California Love\" so did those ancient Greeks get rowdy when their hometown is mentioned.  (I hope you're now picturing ancient Greeks in a modern club because I am.)   <br /><br />I suppose even without a direct or even conscious connection, The Iliad is still managing to influence modern works.  Or else I just see connections where none exist.  But if you'd like to play 6 degrees of The Iliad with something else as random as west coast rap, please include it in the comments!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:43+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:43+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-07T16:28:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea35dde223867000327","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"The Iliad","slug":"the-iliad","url":"/articles/tags/the-iliad"},{"value":"California Love","slug":"california-love","url":"/articles/tags/california-love"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea45dde22641900064d","title":"Book Blog Hop IX","slug":"book-blog-hop-ix","url":"/articles/book-blog-hop-ix","body":"I was debating skipping this week's hop, hosted by <a href=\"http://www.crazy-for-books.com/2010/09/book-blogger-hop-september-3-6-2010.html\">Crazy-for-Books</a>, but then I realized that hurricane is supposed to hit the East coast all weekend and I'll probably be trapped inside so what better to do with my time than hop around and find some new book blogs.

I underestimated how long it would take me to read Tropper's book and all of my other books were packed for the move so I was at a bit of a loss as to what to read next.  I started reading Lamb again but Boyfriend is currently in the middle of it so he was anxious to get me another book and get Lamb back.  Even though he's been reading it for about 10 years (or like 5 months but it feels like 10 years).<br /><br />So we were out shopping and I decided I'd buy a new book so he could go back to not reading Lamb.  I saw both The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Book Thief sitting on a shelf.  Now, I'm supposed to be reading TGwtDT for my book club (apparently I'm the only one to have read <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/screw-us-steel-were-bigger-than-damn\">What's My Name, Fool?</a> and everyone picked another book before our meeting) but I wasn't really in the mood for it.  I've read mixed things about Dragon Tattoo but excellent things about The Book Thief so I'll just have to rush to get the book club book finished in time at some other date.<br /><br />First of all, I didn't realize The Book Thief is considered a children's book.  I'm halfway through the book and it wasn't until this morning when I glanced at all the awards listed on the back of the book and saw \"Winner of the Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Children's Literature\".  What now?  This book is?  Really?  I know it deals with children and I was thinking that the sentences are very simple but it doesn't feel like it's talking down to the audience. I thought it was a stylistic choice that works for the narrator.  Maybe it's because the subject is the Holocaust that I didn't think of it as a children's book.  Maybe I'm not familiar enough with children's lit to know it unless it's very obviously for children.  Now that I've typed that I don't even know if I could describe the rules for \"very obviously for children\".  Roald Dahl comes to mind.  As does Louis Sachar.  OK I won't keep naming children's authors but what I am going to say is this book doesn't feel like those.  It feels more mature than a children's work.<br /><br />Death (with a capital D for those familiar with Moore's work A Dirty Job) is the narrator.  It feels a bit like a gimmick, that Zusak could have just made an outside person the narrator and not have it be Death.  But the fact that Death is the narrator didn't distract me from the book and it gives the opportunity to have an omnipotent unbiased narrator.  The story can explore so many more other characters that a single human narrator wouldn't be able to look at.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I'm only about halfway through the book so I hope to have additional concluding thoughts but so far the book is very touching and very moving and I'm really enjoying it.  <br /><br />Title quote from page 3.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:44+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:44+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-03T03:07:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea45dde22fdcf00057c","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Markus Zusak","slug":"markus-zusak","url":"/articles/tags/markus-zusak"},{"value":"The Book Thief","slug":"the-book-thief","url":"/articles/tags/the-book-thief"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea55dde22641900064f","title":"Blog Tag!","slug":"blog-tag","url":"/articles/blog-tag","body":"I was supposed to start reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for book club (because apparently I'm the only person that read What's My Name, Fool?) but instead of buying TGwtDT I picked up  The Book Thief instead, entirely based on reviews from people in the book blog world.  So thank you all that posted about it!  <br /><br />While I work on reading this new book, Ms. C over at <a href=\"http://coffeetalereviews.blogspot.com/\">Coffee Tale Reviews</a> has pulled me into a game of blog tag and I kind of have the mentality of a small child so I love games!  So you're supposed to answer the questions below and then tag some of your favorite bloggers.  And as Ms. C said, if you don't want to play, no worries.  Just know that I'm a big fan of your blog.<br /><br /><ol><li>Milk or dark chocolate? Dark.  I really don't like milk chocolate unless there's a fair amount of other flavors to temper it.  I'm not a fan of milk in general so I guess this makes sense.</li><li>What's your favorite color? Currently green in all sorts of shades, especially bright ones.  I used to have a lime green phone that I may have selected mostly based on the color.  I'm easily impressed like that.</li><li>Do you have any creative hobbies? It's sad how little creative work I do now.  I used to do a lot of photography and drawing but I haven't done either in awhile.  I did just recently buy a DSLR camera in the hopes of getting back into photography.  I figure if I don't have darkroom access (because I'm too lazy to find some) I can still play with some nice digital photos.  And I suppose this blog can count as a creative hobby since I started it in an attempt to get back into writing.</li><li>What was your favorite subject in school? English, but I suppose that isn't a surprise considering a) I got my degree in English and b) I write this book blog thing.  I also enjoyed the photography classes I've taken but I gave math a lot of leeway to do it's own thing.  </li><li>What is your favorite season?  Why? I used to always consider winter my favorite season because I loved how it looked and I was an avid snowboarder.  I now haven't been snowboarding in roughly the last 6 years and I have to walk a portion of my way to work which means I kind of hate winter now.  That's probably too strong of a word, but I'm sure once winter comes to Boston again I won't think so.  For now it's fall.  I like when it's not too hot (I'm too pale for the sun) but it's not freezing either.  And fall has Halloween and Thanksgiving and since I'm a big fan of food, these are 2 of my favorite holidays.</li><li>Who inspires you to sing like crazy when nobody is around? Pretty much any song I know at least a portion of the lyrics to inspires me to sing like crazy and people can be around.  I have no problem belting out songs with close friends or Boyfriend nearby, looking at me like I'm nuts.  We've had the Broadway version of American Idiot in the car that I love singing along to and we recently added an 80s CD (new wave &amp; hair bands) so I've been going to town on that one too.  What's more fun than belting out \"You Give Love a Bad Name?\" </li><li>What's your favorite dessert?  Can you make it? I don't really have one favorite, go-to dessert.  I really like panna cotta and bread pudding, neither of which I've ever tried to make so who knows how it would go.  This question is making me think about desserts I can make and I just realized I have a recipe for key-lime raspberry bars with a coconut shortbread crust that I want to make again.  So I didn't answer the question but I did think of something to do this weekend.  Assuming I can find where I put that recipe.</li><li>How did you learn to cook? Cook by watching my dad and grandma, bake by watching my mom and other grandma. A couple of my friends are amazing cooks as well but I don't know if I really learn from them so much as sit in wonder while they buzz around the kitchen.  I used to look through my friend's books when he was in cooking school and I thought they were very interesting if way over my head.  I'll let him do all the heavy culinary lifting</li></ol>And now a few bloggers I love reading that may enjoy a game of tag<br /><br /><a href=\"http://thebookstop.wordpress.com/\">The Book Stop</a><br /><a href=\"http://fartooimportantblog.blogspot.com/\">The Far Too Important Blog</a><br /><a href=\"http://literarymusings-blog.blogspot.com/\">Literary Musing </a><br /><a href=\"http://litaddictedbrit.blogspot.com/\">Lit Addicted Brit</a><br /><a href=\"http://thespacebard.blogspot.com/\">The Space Bard</a>","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:45+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:45+00:00","published_at":"2010-09-02T00:53:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea55dde226419000650","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224ea65dde2223b6000192","title":"What I know about sitting shiva?","slug":"what-i-know-about-sitting-shiva","url":"/articles/what-i-know-about-sitting-shiva","body":"What do I know about sitting shiva? Pretty much nothing.  One of the main plot points of Tropper's This Is Where I Leave You is that the family of recently deceased Foxman patriarch is sitting shiva.  I'm not Jewish and the most I knew about sitting shiva came from the episode of Weeds \"Three Coolers\" from season 4.  It was one of the episodes with Albert Brooks of The Simpsons and by the way, what ever happened to Weeds?  Season 1 was amazing and even seasons 2 and 3 were entertaining but they lost me after that.  Once Conrad and Heylia were no longer regular characters I quit watching.  I mean, how could you get rid of those 2?  They were my favorite characters. <br /><br />Anyway, back sitting shiva. Actually no.  Not back to sitting shiva because to try to say that I somewhat understand it after reading this book is a lie and a mean thing to say about a meaningful religious ceremony.  What I will do is go back to the book.  I mentioned in my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/shouldnt-you-be-home-sitting-sheba\">last post</a> about this book that the anger caught me off guard, though it really shouldn't have because the book is very honest about the anger from the get go.  Throughout the rest of the book the anger doesn't go away and in many cases it's explained without being entirely resolved.  This feels slightly anti-climactic but it would be a lie if the problems were explained away at the end and everyone were to go off into the sunset singing \"Age of Aquarius\".  (If you don't understand that reference go check out The 40 Year Old Virgin.  By the way, Conrad is in there!  This post is making all sorts of connections.)<br /><br />Situations are exaggerated for comic value but the story and the relationships still feel honest.  The story drew me in, even though I don't think I was necessarily in the right frame of mind to start this book.  As I mentioned I didn't have a choice because all of the other books were packed so I continued through it and I'm glad I did. <br /><br />I do wish the character Wendy was better fleshed out.  You mostly see her making smart ass comments (my favorite kind) to her brothers while trying to deal with her own body issues and her asshole husband.  Tropper sets her up as an interesting character with potential and yet you never understand her childhood, her anger or why she became the person she is.  The story is told from the point of view of her brother and perhaps we learn so little about her because her brother never learns much about her.  We see Judd and his brothers Phillip and Paul at least try to work through their old issues but Wendy is never really dealt with.  And yet I still found this quote one of the most heartbreaking of the book:<br /><blockquote>[Wendy] fell in love often, and with great fanfare, throwing herself into each romance with the focus of an Olympic athlete.  Now she's a mother and a wife, who tries to get her screaming baby to sleep through the night, tries to stop her boys from learning curse words, and calls romantic love useless. (321)</blockquote>I do have a few questions for those who have read This Is Where I Leave You (and even if you haven't read it feel free to weigh in, but there may be spoilers.)<br /><br />-What do you think Judd's dream about his missing leg means?  The idea that he needs his father to help him stand seems to make sense but also seems to simple and I think I'm missing something.<br />-Did you picture Judd as <a href=\"http://www.superiorpics.com/albert_brooks/\">Albert Brooks</a> (see, the connections keep on coming!)?  <br />-What'd you think about Horry and his relationship with Wendy?  What about Wendy's justification for sleeping with Horry?<br />-What do you hope happens to Judd?  Do you think he should end up with Jen? With Penny?  With no one?<br />-Who was your favorite character?  I obviously mentioned how much I like Wendy but I was also a fan of Phillip.  He was an idiot and a bit of a man-child but he was at least honest if clueless.  This doesn't mean I'd want to hang out with him and certainly not date him but he made for a character I liked to read about and didn't want to punch several times per page (see: Paul).<br /><br />Tropper, Jonathan.

Even so I've never had an actual rating system and I've no plans to add one.

Greg over at <a href=\"http://thenewdorkreviewofbooks.blogspot.com/\">The New Dork Review</a> has written about Tropper a few times and his descriptions are what initially made me want to check him out.  Then I started hearing about Tropper, especially his book This Is Where I Leave You, on a bunch of book blogs.  Unfortunately I don't remember all of the other places I've seen it or I would include links to each of them and give everyone their due credit.<br /><br />I'm about 1/2 way through the book but I wanted to share my initial thoughts.  The book is funny but very angry.  I guess this is understandable.  It opens with the main character finding out his dad has died not long after he walks in on his wife screwing his boss.  I was prepared for the sarcasm, the wit and the snarkiness, but not the anger.  This isn't to say that the anger doesn't work.  I think it's because I'm coming off of Christopher Moore who is very witty and sarcastic with a good dose of dark humor, but even with all of this there is a happiness to it.  Even in Fool, the retelling of the tragedy of King Lear, there is a lightness that goes along with the darkest moments.  Tropper caught me off guard, though he really shouldn't have.  What I'm getting is exactly what I've been told to expect from both fellow bloggers and the book summary.  This has lead me to wonder if reading this book right now was smart or if I should have waited until I was in a different frame of mind.  For the most part I'm enjoying the book but I did consider putting the book down and trying it again. It seems like the kind of book I will really enjoy and I want to make sure I'm getting the most out of it. But I'm reading it now in part because I am liking it enough to continue on and also because I've already moved by box of books over to my new place and the other books are packed. <br /><br />Have you ever started a book but knew it was the wrong time and you wouldn't enjoy it as much right then?  What would you do if you thought you weren't going to get the most out of a book at the time you were reading it? <br /><br />On a different note, this is the second signed copy of a book I've bought recently.  The first was I Was Told There'd Be Cake.  I don't go out of my way to buy signed copies and I won't pay more for them but they do excite me.  I don't know why.  It's not like I was even there to meet the author and get my copy of the book signed.  There's no logical reason to like the signed copies so much, hence the reason I won't pay more for it, but I do smile a little wider when I see that \"Signed Copy\" sticker on the cover.  Perhaps if these authors become super famous these autographed copies will be worth a lot of money.  Fingers crossed. <br /><br />Title quote from page from page 72.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:47+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:47+00:00","published_at":"2010-08-25T13:33:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea75dde2223b6000195","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"This Is Where I Leave You","slug":"this-is-where-i-leave-you","url":"/articles/tags/this-is-where-i-leave-you"},{"value":"Jonathan Tropper","slug":"jonathan-tropper","url":"/articles/tags/jonathan-tropper"}]}]},{"id":"53224ea75dde22386700032a","title":"Top Ten Books I Can't Believe I've Never Read","slug":"top-ten-books-i-cant-believe-ive-never-read","url":"/articles/top-ten-books-i-cant-believe-ive-never-read","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/bookcase.jpg\" />I saw this meme hosted by <a href=\"http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/2010/08/julias-top-ten-books-i-cant-believe-ive.html\">The Broke and The Bookish</a> and I like this week's topic.  What are the top 10 books you can't believe you've never read?  This isn't actually in any order, but it is 10 books I haven't read.  Some of them are ones I personally am surprised I haven't read and the others are ones other people are surprised to find out I haven't read.  I can't think of 10 in either category so I'm mixing them together.<br /><br /><ol><li>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.  I've had this book for years and every once in awhile I see it on the shelf and think \"I should read that.  It's short so I could probably finish it today.\"  And then I shrug my shoulders and go back to whatever intelligent activity I was currently engaged in, like watching Wipeout!  I will get around to it eventually, I swear! </li><li>A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle.  This is another book I've had for years, at least since elementary school and yet I never picked it up.  I think I may have missed the boat on this one, like I did with E.T.  I never saw that movie and I think now that I missed it as a child it's not going to mean much to be as an adult.  I may let this one pass me by but I do own it so who knows.</li><li>The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.  My dad bought me this book when I was a child and for the most part I love the new books he introduces me to.  He hit home runs with Catch 22 and Slaughterhouse 5 but I never picked up this one.  I tried it around the time I tried reading the rest of the LotR trilogy.  I think I skimmed 2 pages and then quit.</li><li>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.  I recently bought a copy of this book because I had already read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies twice and I thought it was stupid that I'd never read P&amp;P.</li><li>Lord of the Flies by William Golding.  In my high school English class we were split up into groups.  Some people read Lord of the Flies, some read All's Quiet on the Western Front and my group read 1984.  I plan on reading this one.  Eventually...</li><li>Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare.  I've taken several Shakespeare classes throughout high school and college and this play just never came up in any of them.  I even took an entire class only on Shakespeare's tragedies but we never read this one.  I guess this didn't fit into the professor's definition, which was \"a dream of innocence realized by a fact of guilt that acquiesces therein\".  How I miss academia.</li><li>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis.  I haven't actually read any of the Narnia series but I include this one because I loved the animated movie version.  I can't find when that one came out but I do know it's not the 1979 version.  That box looks way more colorful and happy than I remember the movie being.  I have one of the books on my shelf from when my brother read it, but I never got around to it.</li><li>Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte.  Like P&amp;P, I've never read this one.  I've never been a big fan of British Regency/Victorian lit so normally this wouldn't be a surprise that I haven't read it.

You should absolutely check out the post as well as the comments to see a glimpse into the insanity that is book lovers.  Of course if you're reading this blog you are, at least somewhat, a book lover yourself and know the insanity all too well.  I love this topic and wanted to share some of my ridiculousness with you.<br /><br />I hate when books are dog-eared, covers folded over, spine cracked, pages written on, etc.  I like my books to look as pristine as possible.  I'm not sure why I care so much, but it's enough that I have certain people who are allowed to borrow my books.  It's not that I think people are going to actively destroy my books out of spite but there are only certain friends I've told of my ridiculousness because I know it's silly.  My one friend is amazing and he accidentally bent/tore the cover of one of my books and has gotten me a replacement copy.  This is also my friend that got be a first folio copy of A Midsummer Night's Dream because he is an awesome book gift giver.<br /><br />There are exceptions to my \"no writing in books\" rule.  My college text books have all kinds of writing and highlighting in them.  I like going through some of these text and I can tell if I had any idea what was going on by the amount of highlighting I did.  Oh, the entire essay describing Russian formalists theory is highlighted?  Clearly I thought \"I have no idea what this means and what's important so I'll just highlight all of it and hope I've stumbled across the part I'll need to know about.\"  I don't even mind if I buy a used book that has writing in it.  I just won't do the writing myself, which is stupid because I like the idea of going back and seeing what I've written.  I think one of those e-readers that lets you take margin notes and highlight things would be fantastic for me, at least in theory.  I'm trying out both the Kindle app and the iBooks app on my iPod Touch and I've used the highlighting stuff minimally so far.  <br /><br />I also like my books in a series to match.  I prefer them to be all the same style, publisher etc. My Vonnegut books all match, my Fforde books all look similar.  My Bryson books don't match and for whatever reason that doesn't actually bother me.  I think this just goes to show that even I don't understand my arbitrary rules.  I have 2 sets that have given me a lot of grief.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/LotR+Collection.jpg\" />My Lord of the Rings trilogy doesn't match.  I was never a fan of the books but got dragged to the first movie when it came out and was surprised to find that I loved it!  I went out and bought the first book and...well...I made it through with a lot of effort.  I decided to not read the next book before the movie came out because I didn't want the book to ruin the movie.  I knew I liked the movie better but I was willing to give the books another chance.  Well, after I saw the second movie I went out and bought both the second and third book.  But I failed to notice that they had slightly changed the spine image.  Now instead of creating one scene going across all of the books, it's all messed up.  This bothers me to no end and I wish I had just waited until the last movie came out, so then none of the books would match.  Because I know this was stupid, I won't go out and buy another copy of a book I already own just so I could make sure my set matched.  Or in this case, evenly does not match.  I'd be fine if all of the spine images were different; it's the fact that 2 are the same that drives me nuts. So now the books just taunt me.  Perhaps that's why I couldn't make it through the third book.  The Hobbit doesn't match but since it's not actually part of the trilogy and I got it when I was little, it doesn't bother me.  See, arbitrary rules. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/HP+Collection.jpg\" />As I mentioned, I don't mind if the whole set intentionally doesn't match and that is the case with my Harry Potter set.  I didn't start reading Harry Potter until late in college.  I obviously knew of the books before that but I only started reading it because I wanted books to bring with me to Italy and my brother had a copy of the first one.  I enjoyed it enough to buy the second book at the bookstore in the Rome train station (which has a small but wonderful English language section).  I then put down the series and didn't think about it again until a few years later when the last book came out and my then-roommate was super excited about it.  Wanting me to join her excitement, she lent me the third book during a beach trip.  I underestimated exactly how pale I am and got super sunburned (screw you SPF75 sunscreen) so for the next week I couldn't do much except lay on my stomach and read, so I made it through the next couple books.  I mostly borrowed my friend's books, but I also took a hard cover copy of the 4th book from Brother and bought the fifth book.  Now my collection was all over the place and I realized none of my books matched.  I debated a few times buying one of the complete sets but I had already bought 2 of the books in the series and acquired 2 more and it seemed silly to buy 7 books when I only needed 3.  Cheapness beats out crazy most days.  I instead went for the \"I'll make it intentionally not match\" method.  The hardest one to find is the 6th book, because I wanted it to be short like the second copy.  Thank you self-conscious HP readers for creating an \"adult cover\" version of the book.  Part of me was afraid I was going to end up with some weird HP fanfic, which would have been extra fun seeing how the package was being sent to my work.  But I lucked out and now my collection makes sense to me.<br /><br />This is really the tip of the iceberg.  Perhaps I'll have a future entry with some other book insanity but I think this is enough for one day.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:48+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:48+00:00","published_at":"2010-08-23T13:20:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ea85dde22fdcf000580","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224ea85dde226419000653","title":"Blog Hop VII","slug":"blog-hop-vii","url":"/articles/blog-hop-vii","body":"Once again it's Friday and time for the blog hop hosted by <a href=\"http://www.crazy-for-books.com/2010/08/book-blogger-hop-august-20-23-2010.html\">Crazy for Books</a>.

Seeing how this is my  book blog I will be keeping the post mostly about books.  In this case,  how am I supposed to decide what to bring with me?  I get one lil half  bookshelf thing to bring with me.  How can I decide what gets shipped  down to LI and what will stay with me?  Splitting up all of the other possessions was easy.  Boyfriend is taking all of the important things, like furniture and kitchen equipment, and I'm taking the toys like the various Nintendo systems (oh yes, I have from regular NES through Wii), the Back to the Future trilogy on DVD and martini glasses (which count as toys in World of Red).  But my limited amount of space means a limited amount of books.  I re-read a lot of books because I'm cheap and lazy.  I tend to just stare at my bookshelf while I make my next selection.  Oh, to the untrained eye it may look like staring off into space, but I assure you I'm deep in thought figuring out what I recently have read, what I'm in the mood for and what will help me forget I'm on the subway (most of my reading is done during my commute).  I'm no good at keeping TBR lists.  I go with the \"in the moment\" method of choosing a book.  This is how <a href=\"http://eclectic-indulgence.blogspot.com/2010/08/whats-your-book-selection-strategy.html\">Eclectic Indulgence</a> describes the process and this sounds far better than the ADD method as I've previously described it. You know, like I'm seizing the day instead of being too lazy to walk outside to a bookstore.<br /><br />So how would you choose what books to keep? Obviously this isn't as dire as desert island reads, although I've been fretting over this decision like it is.  I also need to keep in mind I should save some shelf space for the new books I'm sure to acquire.  <br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/This+is+you+C&amp;H2.jpg\" />While I'm on the topic of this move Boyfriend is making happen, I want to include this Calvin &amp; Hobbes panel, which pretty much sums up me and Boyfriend.  I wish I could say I was Hobbes in this relationship but I'm most definitely Calvin.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, I'm super into parenthetical comments in this  post.

Sorry!  Slog through a few more (or just ignore me for the next couple posts) and I'll be onto a new topic in no time.  Promises. I'm also skipping a fellow bloggers post this week because I recently listed out a bunch of my favorite blogs in my <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/blog-award-and-hop-vi\">last post</a>.  If you're at a loss for other blogs to check out and want, nay need, my wisdom check out that list.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Fool+cover.jpg\" />For now I'm re-reading Fool by Christopher Moore.  It's a retelling of King Lear from the Fool's point of view, with some changes here and there to Shakespeare's play.  I'm not sure if it makes any difference if you're familiar or not with Lear before reading this.  I think the story is well told and funny enough that you don't even need to know there is a different version of King Lear but seeing how I already know the story of Lear I can't really say for sure.  That was a rambling way to say I've read Lear before and cannot time travel to see if Fool makes any sense without knowing it.  So there you go.<br /><br />Moore's writing is satirical, humorous and absurd, which is exactly how I like my books.  If you're not yet familiar with his humor, here's the warning he put in the beginning of the book:<br /><blockquote>This is a bawdy tale.  Herein you will find gratuitous shagging, murder, spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity and profanity, as well as non-traditional grammar, split infinitives, and the odd wank.  If that sort of thing bothers you, then gentle reader pass by, for we endeavor only to entertain, not to offend.  That said, if that's the sort of thing you think you might enjoy, then you have happened upon the perfect story!</blockquote>For me, Moore has absolutely provided me a perfect story.  Or at least a very entertaining one.   The story doesn't just strictly follow the King Lear plot but also includes back stories for the fool, Pocket, as well as the pasts of Lear, Cordelia, Goneril and Regan. Pocket has a greater influence over the events of the story than the original play suggests, though it's pulled off in such a way you could see the truth-speaking fool actually having a hand in the action.<br /><br />As is typical of Moore's characters, Pocket is a generally good guy but he certainly engages in some morally questionable plots, usually to suit his own ends or the ends of those he cares about.  He's not all good, which would make him boring and he's not all bad, which would make him unsympathetic.  The gray area is a more interesting mire to wade through.  Just as in the play, Pocket's wit allows him to say and do things that are unsavory when coming from others.  Humor softens the blow.  I've yet to find a Moore book that completely lacks wit, but it works especially well here, where quick wit is a central part to the fool's character.<br /><br />Fool is one of my favorite Moore books, just barely behind Lamb.  I'm sure the fact that it's Shakespeare based plays a good part in making this one of my favorites but the story itself is so well-told and so funny that even if this had been just a generic court jester it still would have been good.  By the way, the book was originally going to just be  about a generic court jester, but his editor told him he should do Lear.  I love that this book includes a little explanation from Moore about his intentions.  And if you want to see an excellent post about author's intentions check out the post about just that over a <a href=\"http://deadwhiteguyslit.blogspot.com/2010/08/how-to-read-classics-part-two.html\">Dead White Guys</a>.  I can't say I think that author's intention is the be-all-end-all to a book and coming up with your own interpretation separate from the author's is pointless and a waste of time, Jane Doe makes a very convincing argument.  I can't think of a good way to counter it, so I'll just agree with The Reading Ape's comment.<br /><br />I'm still debating if I'll have a second post about this book, so there may be one more Shakespeare entry you'll have to read (assuming you'll read the next one if you've made it this far).  I'm about 1/2 way done with the book as is, but because I have read it before I'm confident in the above review.  Don't worry, it won't be a second review of the book or anything entirely redundant, though I'm sure I'll make mention of the humor again.  If I find an aspect that particularly catches my eye, you'll see another entry.  If not, I'll be off on some other topic.<br /><br />Title quote page 29<br /><br />Other Shakespeare posts:<br /><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/i-think-you-showed-lot-of-heart-lot-of\">I think you showed a lot of heart!

And while I'm holding onto it it made sense to me to read it again.  Plus I'm currently out of new books to read and I'm trying to save money although I'm sure this won't last too long. It's just a matter of time before the call of the bookstore draws me in.<br /><br />I've tried to describe the book to people before and I just end up repeating the subtitle.  \"Well, you see, it's a book about Shakespeare.  But there's also a lot of drugs and sex.\"  I'm so eloquent.  So let me try a little harder this time.  It's actually the tale of two Shakespeares.  Also sex and drugs.  I hope that cleared everything up!<br /><br />Alright, I'll give this one more try.  It is the story of two Shakespeares: the William Shakespeare you know and (I hope) love and then there's William \"Willie\" Shakespeare Greenberg, the modern day Shakespearean scholar.  The chapters alternate between Willie's journey to figure out his master's thesis, that Shakespeare was a closet Catholic, his task to deliver drugs to a Renaissance Faire and his goal to have a lot of sex along the way.  Then there's the Bard's life before he began writing, the poaching of the deer in Sir Thomas Lucy's grounds, his trip to London and having a lot of sex along the way.  The stories parallel one another, showing how the two Shakespeare's react to similar but entirely different situations.  There's a scene where Shakespeare is being tortured by Sir Lucy that mimics a scene with Willie and his girlfriend in bed together.  See, similar but different; I wasn't just being complicated there.  The two Shakespeare's are also persecuted to varying degrees: for Willie it comes from the DEA and Reagan's recently implemented mandatory minimum sentencing and for Shakespeare it's those darn Protestants.<br /><br />I liked the Shakespeare chapters better than the Willie ones.  Both sets are interesting but I'm personally more interested in Shakespeare's life, even a fictional telling of his lost years.  You see into a world of Shakespeare if he was a closet Catholic and how his early life may have influenced his later writing, including the more important lesson of the theater \"Know Thy Audience\" which lets him move beyond political allegory and create characters for all ages. Winfield's Shakespeare could be the early version of Joseph Fiennes' Shakespeare of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/\">Shakespeare in Love</a>. There is more at stake in Shakespeare's story and more chance for him to grow.  Willie's story is funny and kept me entertained but it couldn't draw me in the same way Shakespeare's chapters did.<br /><br />There are a lot of little nods to Shakespeare, as would be expected.  Some work well and others are more obvious and feel a bit more awkward.  And of course there is a lot of humor.

My original intention was to post this stuff on Mondays but the second I try to give myself some sort of schedule I break it.  But I had just finished <em><a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/screw-us-steel-were-bigger-than-damn\">What's My Name, Fool?</a></em> and wanted to get my thoughts down and out there.  Now I know I'm obviously the main voice you listen to when trying to decide what else to read, so I didn't want to make you go too long without telling you what to do.  I'm kind like that.  Anyway, here are a couple more blogs you should check out.  <br /><br /><a href=\"http://coffeetalereviews.blogspot.com/\">Coffee Tale Reviews</a> - I just recently started following Ms. C's blog but I've already gone through her past posts and found interesting topics.  She reviews some contemporary novels, some classics and she includes some cookie recipes which I've yet to try but look delicious.  You should check out her latest entry <a href=\"http://coffeetalereviews.blogspot.com/2010/08/hitlers-private-library.html\">Hitler's Private Library</a> and what our library collections say about us if anything.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/\">The Reading Ape</a> - Check out this blog if you are looking for intelligent, interesting, well-thought out posts about books and the book world.  He's had a couple posts recently about Amazon questionable business practices that make me reconsider where my book money goes and also tackles topics about the gender divide in the book blogging universe.  I have a general tendancy to enjoy posts about general topics but his <a href=\"http://thereadingape.blogspot.com/2010/07/particular-disappointment-of-failed.html\">review of <em>The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake</em></a> appealed to me and gave me a better idea of what to expect with this book (or not in my case since I don't plan on reading it) than other reviews have.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://volcanicensemble.blogspot.com/\">The Sassy Curmudgeon</a> - Una isn't actually a book blogger and at this point I can't even remember how I stumbled onto her blog, but I am loving it. I do know the first entry I read was about her <a href=\"http://volcanicensemble.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-i-did-over-my-summer-vacation-or.html\">trying out the Wine Rack</a>, which is a sports bra with special pouches to hold a bottle of wine.  Wheee! Plus Bill watches over her blog at the bottom of the page.  Double score! (I know his name is actually Martin Starr but he'll always be Bill from <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> to me.)<br /><br />Enjoy!  And if you know of any other awesome blogs leave a comment and tell us about them!<br /><br />P.S.!

That's a lie.  My first thoughts were \"What is this book?  Sports?  Who picked this one? I don't want to read this.\" And the point of book club is mostly so we can all get together, drink wine, catch up and maybe, if a couple people have read the book, discuss some of it.  Reading the book is not actually a necessary part of this book club, which means that if I really didn't want to read the book, I can still hang out with everyone.   <br /><br />But I decided to suck it up and at least see what the book is actually about.  Radical idea, right?  I know <a href=\"http://heylady.net/2010/08/06/why-i-hate-amazon-and-will-never-ever-ever-buy-from-them-again/\">Amazon is a great big bully</a>, but they at least provide the first few pages of this apparently out-of-print-only-found-online book and I learned that this book is actually about discrimination in sports and how various people and groups have fought against injustice.  Ah, this sounds more like something my reading group would come up with.  And so I decided to actually read the book.<br /><br />If you didn't guess from my knee-jerk reaction to the book, I'm not a huge sports fan.  Or even a little one.  But sports still regularly fit into my life as both my dad and Boyfriend are huge sports fans and Boyfriend works in sports.  I just can't get away from it.  But their enthusiasm has somewhat helped me with this book.  I at least recognized certain players, even if Boyfriend was disappointed I didn't know all of the teams Carlos Delgado has played for.  I tried to explain that he's lucky I recognize the name at all (Boyfriend is a Mets fan).  Oh well. That was a long way of saying I won't be able to comment on the sports aspect of the book with any sort of authority.  <br /><br />I liked this book to a point.  It's not so much a single coherent book as it's a series of related short essays about racism, sexism and homophobia in sports.  This format worked for me as it made it easier for me to move quickly through certain essays.  The sections of the book where he discusses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_robinson\">Jackie Robinson</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali\">Muhammad Ali</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute\">the 1968 Mexico City Olympics</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King\">Billie Jean King</a> are wonderful, sad and thought provoking.  He includes interviews with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Evans_%28athlete%29\">Lee Evans</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Meggyesy\">David Meggyesy</a> to give a first person take on some of the biggest moments in sports.  Maybe it's because these stories aren't so fresh but he's had the benefit of hindsight when writing that these stories come off as more powerful for me.  His essays on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman\">Pat Tillman</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_Five_%28University_of_Michigan%29\">the Fab Five</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hnida\">Kate Hnida</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Clarett\">Maurice Clarett</a> still tell important stories but his anger over the injustices he discusses, while justified and understandable, overshadows the larger point he's trying to make. He uses these examples as jumping off points to a larger issue, but the leap happens so abruptly that I feel like there is more to the stories about Tillman et al. that I'm missing.<br /><br />It was an interesting read that I think could have been better.  I may have a follow up post once we have book club again and I see what others have to say.  I'm also going to recommend the book to Boyfriend and my dad.  I'd like to see what a sports fan thinks about the book.<br /><br />Title quote from page 17 <br /><br />Zirin, Dave.  What's My Name, Fool?: Sports and Resistance in the United States.

So just as sporadically I figured I'd share those moments here. You're welcome. I'll consider this my Shakespeare Break.  This time the break was triggered by the production of Othello put on in the Boston Commons by the <a href=\"http://commshakes.org/shows/current_show/Othello/shows_current.html\">Commonwealth Shakespeare Company</a>.  Free Shakespeare and <a href=\"http://02a7d0b.netsolhost.com/index2.html\">Parish Cafe</a> sandwiches: a great way to spend a summer night.<br /><br />Seeing Othello again made me think about how Iago manipulates Othello to bring him down.  I should start out saying I'm skeptical of the idea of the tragic flaw, that Othello is brought down only because he is too trusting.  This makes both Iago and Othello seem like weak characters.  This is not my own conclusion but comes from Shakespeare Is Hard, But So Is Life: A Radical Guide to Shakespearean Tragedy by Fintan O'Toole.   I won't get too much into this book, as I'm sure that will be a later post, but just to say that O'Toole claims that the idea of the tragic flaw removes the concept of free will; the characters are destined to behave the way they do. Looking at Othello as having a tragic flaw robs Iago of his twisted powers of persuasion.  <br /><br />So what does Othello have to do with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_transitivity\">transitive relation or law of transitives</a>?  For those who don't remember, the transitive relation states essentially if A = B and B = C then A = C.  I also included a link to the Wikipedia page, which can give you more information should you be curious and which I had to check to make sure I was somewhat getting this right.  For the point I'll be making you only need to know the info in the example above.  So I'll ask again (because I assume your memory is as good as mine and if more than 10 seconds have passed you forgot what we were talking about)  what does this algebraic rule have to do with Shakespeare?  Iago uses this basic formula to plant and nurture those seeds of distrust in Othello.<br /><br />Iago <br />     Ha, I like not that. <br /><br />Othello<br />     What dost thou say?<br /><br />Iago<br />     Nothing, my lord; or if--I know not what.<br /><br />Othello<br />     Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?<br /><br />Iago<br />     Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it<br />     That he would steal away so guiltylike,<br />     Seeing you coming.<br /><br />Othello<br />     I do believe 'twas he.<br /><br />Desdemona<br />     How now, my lord?<br />     I have been talking with a suitor here,<br />     A man that languishes in your displeasure.<br /><br />Othello<br />     Who is't you mean?<br /><br />Desdemona<br />      Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.<br /> III.iii.37-49<br /><br />Iago knew that was Cassio talking to Desdemona; he had advised Cassio to have Desdemona plead on his behalf and hopefully make it back into Othello's good graces.  Yet Iago plants the seed here.  He points out a man \"[stealing] away so guiltylike\" from Desdemona and when Othello asks if that was Cassio, Iago says it couldn't be.  Cassio is a fine, up-standing man and a good man wouldn't sneak away from another man's wife like that.  But when the two men make it to Desdemona she tells them that was Cassio.  So we've set up the following equation<br /><br />Cassio = Good Man<br />Good Man = Wouldn't \"steal away so guiltylike\"<br />Cassio = Wouldn't \"steal away so guiltylike\"<br /><br />It may seem setting this up will not meet Iago's end as the very first equation is Cassio is a good man.  But to truly be the conniving character he is, Iago must work within the rules that have been set up.  Othello believes Cassio to be a good man, so the first thing Iago must do is destroy this first assumption.  He sets up the drunken fight and then he sets up the rules above, knowing full well the logic is going to fall apart.  When Desdemona tells them that it was Cassio she was just speaking with, we have a break down in the logic.  The last rule no longer applies as we now know it was Cassio that slunk off.  Iago has set Othello up to use the logic above, so with this new information Othello comes to the following conclusion:<br /><br />Cassio = Did \"steal away so guiltylike\"<br />Good Man = Wouldn't \"steal away so guiltylike\"<br />Cassio = Not a Good Man<br /><br />Had Iago just told Othello he shouldn't trust Cassio Othello would just have to believe Iago for the story to work and if we believe he is simply \"too trusting\" and also not-so-bright this would work.  It wouldn't necessarily be all that interesting to read about such dull characters but it would get the job done.  Instead Iago leads Othello in such a way that Othello, to the best of his knowledge, came to his own conclusion about Cassio.  If anything Othello sees Iago defending Cassio, saying of course he wouldn't be sneaking away like that!  Iago is seen as much more powerful, much more cunning and thus much more frightening than if Othello simply believes whatever he says because of some tragic flaw.  The point now is that Othello is intelligent but even he could be lead astray by the snake Iago, which means the reader could also be lead astray, no matter how smart they may think they are.<br /><br />Shakespeare, William.

I especially liked his review of the story <a href=\"http://towerofstories.blogspot.com/2010/07/new-yorker-review-honest-exit-by-dinaw.html\">\"An Honest Exit\"</a> and the link so I could read the original story myself.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://thecuriousreader.blogspot.com/\">The Curious Reader</a> - It was the blog entries about <a href=\"http://thecuriousreader.blogspot.com/2010/06/next.html\">Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series</a> and Shakespeare that drew me in.  It's easy to appreciate someone's tastes when they match yours, isn't it?  I love the tone and style she used and even if I disagree and happen to enjoy <em>Titus Andronicus</em> (because even with the classics I seem to be drawn towards the trashier examples) I think she makes a fairly convincing argument.  <br /><br />I hope you check out the blogs above and find something you like!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:52+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:52+00:00","published_at":"2010-08-02T19:08:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eac5dde2223b60001a3","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"fellow bloggers","slug":"fellow-bloggers","url":"/articles/tags/fellow-bloggers"}]}]},{"id":"53224ead5dde2223b60001a4","title":"Book Blog Hop IV","slug":"book-blog-hop-iv","url":"/articles/book-blog-hop-iv","body":"Once again it's time for the weekly Blog Hop hosted by <a href=\"http://www.crazy-for-books.com/2010/07/book-blogger-hop-july-30-aug-2-2010.html\">Crazy for Books</a>.  So this week's question is who is your favorite new-to-you author of the year?<br /><br />I wish I had an answer that didn't involve an author I feel like I'm constantly talking about here but it does.  I don't know how I missed him before but Christopher Moore is my newest favorite author.  A friend hounded me for the longest time to read Lamb and once I finally go around to it I understood why.  Since that point earlier in the year I've read 5 more of his books.  I've only gotten around to posting about one of the books, <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/for-guy-that-maintains-low-profile\">Coyote Blue</a>, but more are certain to follow.  I'm trying to take a break from Moore for awhile but I'm sure I'll be drawn back soon.<br /><br />Edit: I didn't notice until Bookangel pointed it out but I didn't describe <a href=\"http://www.chrismoore.com/\">Moore's work</a> at all.  His books can be categorized as satirical, absurdest, humor and literary.  Lamb's full title is Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.  He has another work, Fool, which is King Lear told from the Fool's point of view.

I also finally got my copy of What's My Name, Fool?: Sports and Resistance in the United States for my book club so I will most likely read that book as well before I finish up with S&amp;N.  I like being able to break up S&amp;N, both reading and writing about it.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Book+of+Vice+cover.jpg\" />The title quote is the basic working definition Sagal uses to determine vice in The Book of Vice: Very Naughty Things (and How to Do Them).  Now this isn't actually a how-to book of vice.  I'm pretty sure I found it on one of the humor tables at the bookstore.  The title caught my eye and the fact that it is written by Peter Sagal of NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Meg made me pick it up.  It's what you expect from the host of WWDTM: ridiculous and fairly pretentious.  I mean this as the highest compliment because pretentious comments lose their power when used to describe things like penis pumps.  Here are the opening lines to the chapter \"Swinging or Dinner Parties Gone Horribly Wrong\": <br /><blockquote>It is a truth universally acknowledged that when a couple at a swingers club announce that they are there merely to observe, and not actually to swing, everybody loses interest in that couple pretty quickly. (19)</blockquote>I was trying to come up with a good way to describe this book but I've been having trouble coming up with a good way to really get the story and humor to come through.  So I figure I'll just wriggle out of doing any work myself and give you a quote from each of the chapters.  I'd say I'm sneaky like that but I obviously just told you of my plans. Watch me do the quote thing anyway.<br /><br />\"Eating or Sodom's Restaurant\":<br /><blockquote>Many restaurants offer information on where the various ingredients are raised or farmed, so we can be certain, as we dig into our pork tenderloin with the demi-apricot glace, that the meat comes from an animal whose throat was cut by someone it knew and trusted.  There are those who say the ironic betrayal adds piquancy to the flesh. (51-52)</blockquote>\"Strip Clubs or Sure, They Like You, Really\":<br /><blockquote>The professors have tremendous respect for the dancers, who, they told me, were doing their best to maximize their economic status and take control over their financial/sociocultural destinies. \"McDonald's, now that's a degrading job\". (84)</blockquote> \"Lying or This Chapter Will Change Your Life and Make You Millions!\":<br /><blockquote>I began researching the play [Denial] primarily because I was interested in exploring why Holocaust deniers are so effective in achieving their goal -- which is annoying Jews. (114)</blockquote>\"Gambling or Dice, Cards, Wheels, and Other Lethal Weapons\":<br /><blockquote>[Las Vegas] seemed like the veritable neon level of hell, Virgil's City of Dis with better lighting.(133)</blockquote>\"Consumption or How To Keep Up With the Joneses When the Joneses Are Insane\":<br /><blockquote>...Commodore Green also owned what may have been the world's only diamond-encrusted chamber pot, which, in re his innate attitude toward the nature and source of his wealth, would send any Freudian into fits of ecstasy. (161)</blockquote> \"Pornography or You Can Look, But You Can't Admit It\":<br /><blockquote>But it's the early stuff, the chiaroscuro photos of hard-core sex from the 1910s and earlier, that really arrest attention.  They look so old that you surmise the models were held still by iron apparatuses holding their heads, like Abraham Lincoln being rotogravured by Mathew Brady. (In this context, even \"rotogravured\" sounds dirty.) (192-193)</blockquote>Now to actually give my two cents on the book: you won't actually learn much from it but it is funny and you can feel slightly pretentious while reading it.  And if you read it in public you get lots of interesting looks, a few nods of approval and some stifled giggles.  <br /><br />See the article at <a href=\"http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/31/44-public-radio/\">Stuff White People Like: Public Radio</a><br /><br />Title quote from page 15<br /><br />Sagal, Peter.

I'll catch you next post. --<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Strange+%26+Norell3.jpg\" />Do you ever find yourself surprised by how much you like a character?  You're reading along and you see a character appear time and time again.  They aren't the main character but they are a major supporting character.  You don't really think too much of them though.  You like them well enough but you don't really think about them and the BAM the story takes a turn and that character is gone.  All of a sudden you realize how upset you are that the character is gone and much you looked forward to them showing up in a scene, adding their two cents.  Not only are you caught off guard by their disappearance but you suddenly realize how much you hate the character that caused your secret-favorite character to go away.<br /><br />Apparently my favorite character has been Arabella Strange.  She snuck up on me.  We are first introduced to her through Jonathan Strange's description, though his initial description proves to be false rather quickly.  He thinks \"sometimes it seemed as if she had fallen in love with him for the sole purpose of quarreling with him\" (244) and then he lists all of the things he anticipates she will argue about.  He even imagines entire arguments she's going to draw him into.  This gives an impression that she's a nag but even in his arguments a very loving nag.  But still, a nag.  Luckily the narrator jumps in and explains that his love for Arabella has \"produced a most inexact portrait of her,\" (254) and when she does appear on the scene she is actually wonderful.  She's kind and she genuinely loves Strange, which in and of itself is a nice thing to see for characters in this time. <br /><br />I liked all the scenes with Arabella but I guess I never really thought about her too much.  But then she was taken away by the jerk-face (I become a 4 year old when upset) with the thistle-down hair to be another toy in his Lost-Hope balls.  But unlike Lady Pole and Stephen, who gets to leave Faerie land every day, Arabella \"dies\" in the human world and is a permanently a prisoner.  So at first I was just mad at the this thistle-down hair man because obviously he is the one who actually took Arabella. But getting mad at him for acting selfishly is silly.  I may as well get mad at a zombie for eating brains; it's just in it's nature and it's your fault if you get in the way.  So who is culpable?  Who's fault is it?  Then Lady Pole came through and shed the light when she tried to shoot Norrell.<br /><br />Up until this point I liked Norrell.  Not in a seems-like-a-fun-guy-we-should-hang-out kind of way, but in the fact that he's an interesting character while boring and annoying the other characters is pretty great.  But he brought the thistle-down hair man to their world to wreak havoc and when he heard that Lady Pole was driven mad by Arabella's \"death\" he knows what's actually happened but he doesn't come forward.  He's a coward.  I'm fine with annoying, overly-cautious, boring characters but this guy is the worst kind of coward and I want him taken down.  <br /><br />Strange &amp; Norrell is only getting more interesting and now I can't wait to see what happens next.  I hope it involves having Arabelle and Norrell changing places or at least just bring Arabella back.  <br /><br />Title quote from pages 667-668<br /><br />Clarke, Susanna.

Joanne over at <a href=\"http://www.bookloverbookreviews.com/\">Booklover Book Review</a> takes the hop an extra step and includes links to some new blogs that caught her eye.  I think this is a great idea, and not just because she mentioned by blog (although it certainly helped. Thanks for the shout out!).  So here are a couple of the blogs I enjoy and you should check out<br /><br /><a href=\"http://petekarnas.wordpress.com/\">What You Read</a> - This was one of the first book blogs I started reading when I began blogging not so long ago.

I spent last weekend at the shore and perhaps Strange &amp; Norrell isn't the typical beach read, but as I literally read it on a beach, it's getting thrown in that category.  Besides my beach trips mostly consist of practically bathing in 70+SPF sunscreen and hiding in any bit of shade I can find, so it almost makes sense to read about an English setting instead of some light read where people frolic merrily in the sun. (Do books like that exist?  I'm sure they do but now that I've typed it I can't actually think of any.  Ah well.)  <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Strange+%26+Norell2.jpg\" />Anyway, I'm more than half way through Volume II (page 497) in which we are (finally) introduced to Jonathan Strange.  This isn't a criticism of the pacing of the book; there is a lot of book to get through.  But before this new volume we spent a long time with Norrell with no reprieve.  Strange is a breath of fresh air.  As the book cover describes \"Young, handsome and daring, Strange is the very antithesis of Norrell,\" but it's not the fact that he is bizarro Norrell that makes him so interesting.  It's the fact that, as a fellow magician, he doesn't defer and give in to Norrell about everything.  The title quote in particular is from a scene that displays Strange's abilities to, as Lascelles says, out-maneuver Norrell.  Norrell has been hiding books from Strange from the moment they met and Norrell only agrees to convince Strange to help aid the war effort in Portugal because it means Strange won't be around to bid on a rare book collection that will recently become available.  So before Strange leaves he asks Norrell if he can borrow a number of books and, as dictated by etiquette, Norrell is forced to comply even though it means his books will be subject to all sorts of perils such as torn pages and damaged covers.  There is a part of me that understands Norrell's fear of damaged books but on the other hand, shut up Norrell.  <br /><br />As I mentioned, Strange goes to Portugal to help with the English cause in the war against the French.  Look at that, some action!  And a magician that does magic.  He really is bizarro Norrell.  To be honest, I did enjoy watching Norrell make excuses and disappoint people when he would never perform magic and be a general bore.  He may be a sourpuss but he doesn't give into the wills of other people, much to Drawlight and Lascelles chagrin.  But it is nice to see a character who is likable and helps to move the plot along.  After some initial distrust from Wellington, Strange becomes an essential part of the war effort with his magic.<br /><br />I especially like the tone the novel takes when discussing magic.  As the book is an alternate history and takes place in a world where magic is a large part of history and take seriously, magic is treated in an almost down-to-earth fashion.  When Strange first manages to prove his worth to Wellington, he suggests magically creating a road for the armies to use.  It would have been easy enough to have that been the end of it: Strange suggests magically creating a road, Wellington agrees, everyone in awe of magic.  Instead there are the details to consider: what should the road be made of, what happens if the French find the road and can make use of it, etc.  It isn't a matter that Clarke overwhelming the book with small details, but the fact that, if magic were real and being used this way, these all sounds like valid points that would be brought up.  And because they make good points about trying to use this magical road in the real world it makes the world more believable.  <br />I'm excited to continue the book and see what else happens to Strange, Norrell and of course the man with the thistle-down hair.  Perhaps my next entry will concern him, unless something else happens during my reading to distract me.  <br /><br />Title quote page 367<br /><br />Clarke, Susanna. <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</em>.

We watched a performance of this play in my high school Shakespeare class and not long after seeing it there I got a VHS copy of the performance and bought the book.  I'm actually on my second copy of the book as the original got lost during one of my many moves and I think I need to upgrade to a DVD copy of the play.  I'm a geek, I know.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Complete+Works+Abridged+cover.jpg\" />Complete Works (abridged) is, as the title suggests, all of Shakespeare's plays as well as the sonnets condensed into a single play and performed by 3 actors.  As Singer describes in his intro note \"[Audiences] of the last quarter of the twentieth century apparently possessed an urgent need to see Shakespeare performed as if it were a Tex Avery cartoon\" and this is certainly what they provide.  Some of the plays get more time than the others which is just fine as I don't need to see more than a brief mention of Troilus and Cressida.  All of the comedies are combined into a single comedy, since they all use pretty much the same plots anyway, and all of the histories and King Lear are combined into an American football game, with the crown being passed back and forth between the \"teams\".  Othello is performed as a rap, Titus Andronicus is a cooking show, and Macbeth leads into Julius Caesar thus making up the \"caesarian\" section of the play.  The second act is all Hamlet, but don't worry, they perform it a few different times and there's a little work-shopping in the middle as they bring members of the audience on stage to act out Ophelia's \"get thee to a nunnery\" scene, complete with an examination of the subtext.<br /><br />If it isn't obvious already, I'm a big Shakespeare fan,g but even if you don't know all of the little details or even all of the plays this work is hilarious.  If you can see it performed you should!  As mentioned I have a very worn VHS copy and I've seen the newest incarnation of the RSC perform The Complete History of America (abridged). I enjoyed it though my American-history buff friend this seemed to have less in-jokes than the Shakespeare play had.  If you can't see it performed, or really even if you can, you should read the book version.  There are several intros and prefaces as each author, the editor, William Shakespeare and the average reader get their input.  Then throughout the play there are footnotes.  Sometimes the notes provide additional information about a particular joke, sometimes they include additional notes on stage direction and most of the time they fall into the dick-and-fart jokes category.  See most of the jokes in the Romeo and Juliet section.  <br /><br />I'll probably make future references to this play in my later posts.  I tend to read this play as a sort of literary palate cleanser, mostly because it's short and I know it so well.  And I plan on having a few Shakespeare related posts so I'm sure this will get mentioned again.<br /><br />Update! I realized while re-reading this post that I can't convey the humor of the play quite as well as some quotes can.  So here is a small sampling of a few of my favorites:<br /><br />\"So now to the feast of Capulet<br />Where Romeo is doomed to meet his Juliet.<br />And where, in a scene of timeless romance,<br />He'll try to get into Juliet's pants.\" 14<br /><br />\"Here's the story of a brother by the name of Othello<br />He liked white women and he liked green Jello\" 33<br /><br />\"In fact, one of [the Lesser plays], 'Troilus and Cressida', is hardly crap at all.\" 50<br /><br />\"I told these guys, 'I will NOT do dry, boring...vomitless Shakespeare for these people,\" 53 <br /><br />One part of Ophelia's Superego during the Workshop portion of the show<br />\"Look, cut the crap, Hamlet, my biological clock is ticking and I want babies now!\" 88 <br /><br />I would like to say thanks to my high school English teachers that taught me to love instead of fear Shakespeare, as so many other teacher seem to do.  So thanks Courtley, Waite and Porrazzo!  <br /><br />Title quote page 84<br /><br />Borgenson, Jess, Adam Long, Daniel Singer.  ed. Professor J.M. Winfield.

As soon as I read it I started laughing and decided I should get a greeting card to send to my brother with this message. I'm a good sister like that.  The Red in my blog name is indeed in reference to my hair color and mean comments about red heads usually make me laugh, especially the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids\">Ginger Kids South Park</a> episode. Maybe the comment would be less funny if I was boy as I've decided girls are mostly immune to red-headed insults.  But the book is about much more than the lack of handsome red heads!<br /><br />The longer I read this book the more I like it.  At this point the only complaint I have is the size of the book.  I mentioned in an <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/07/heavy-tome.html\">earlier po/a> that this book is quickly pushing me over to the e-reader side of that whole argument because of the weight of it.  I feel like a wimp complaining about it but after balancing it in one hand each day to read it I find myself contemplating very tiny books as my next reads /><br />--I want to warn readers that following contains spoilers so if you don't want plot points ruined for you, stop now.-- <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Strange+%26+Norell1.jpg\" />The first volume primarily concerns the titular Mr. Norrell, the last practical magician in England and he very much enjoys his position as the last and importantly the only practicing magician.  He despises the theoretical magicians who study the history of magic yet he other characters are hard-pressed to get Mr Norrell to actually perform any sort of magic.  He performs the first act of magic England has seen in decades, but will only do it if the theoretical magicians agree to take up a new profession if he succeeds.  He only brings Miss Wintertowne back from the dead to win favor with her betrothed and doing so sacrifices half of her life to the faeries.  He refuses to share  any of his magical knowledge except for magical history, as he feels the current literature is all wrong and he drives all of the false magicians out of London.  But he's not an evil character and the fact that he can have such negative qualities and yet not be vilified makes him interesting.  If anything he reminds me of the gentlemen scientists that Bill Bryson mentions in A Short History of Nearly Everything.  He believes that no one but himself is capable of appreciating magic and that everyone else, past and present, has magic all wrong yet he continuously makes excuses for why he can't publish anything or why he can't perform magic and excuse after excuse.  So much of the story so far has been about people trying to convince Mr Norrell to do, well, anything other than sit in his study and read.  <br /><br />--You can read again! The rest is spoiler free.  I know you're excited.--<br /><br />I'm looking forward to finally meeting Jonathan Strange.  He's been mentioned in passing in the footnotes throughout Volume I and there's a little of his history mentioned but for the most part he's a mystery man.  But, since the next volume is called Jonathan Strange I assume we'll be hearing from him.  And the blurb on the back of the book describes Strange as \"young, handsome and daring...the very antithesis of Norrell\" so I'm interested to see a more lively character.<br /><br />Title quote from page 243<br />Image from page 107<br /><br />Clarke, Susanna.

I mean this in the most wonderful way.  There's something about the book that, even before you begin reading it, feels timeless.  Maybe it's the simple cover or the fact that I feel like I've seen this book in a hundred places without ever really being able to place it.  A friend had brought it with him during a spring break trip to Ireland and while I remember him reading it on several of the long bus rides I don't remember him ever talking about it.  (I would think \"who would bring a book like this on spring break\" but I'm usually countered with \"who goes to Ireland for spring break,\" so touche.)  Another friend also read it and recommended it without ever saying why, which was unusual for him as he generally would have be read especially interesting passages out of the books he was reading.  So maybe it's this initial mystery of the book, something other people were reading but weren't talking about, as if it were some inside joke or secret.<br /><br />The style of the book certainly feels like an old book and again, I mean this as a compliment.  The book is an alternate history of England in the early 1800s and Clarke makes it feel like other books written at this time, like Austen.  After I had begun the book I double checked the inside cover to see when this book was actually published.  I'm sure a scholar of Victorian literature could explain to me all of the reasons this is wrong.  I don't mean Clarke's work is equal to Austen.  I haven't read far enough to say if that's the case, but I'm not a huge fan of work from this time period so I can't say if there is a different author from this time she sounds more like.  <br /><br />The book, in a simplified summary, is an alternate history about magicians in England during the Napoleonic wars.  To me this sounds like it could be interesting or it could be very dry, depending on how much of the book is about the wars and how much is about magic.  What I didn't expect is how much it is about general life for the upper middle class and how much of the book is about dinners and card playing and gentlemen.  It's in this sense that it reminds me of the many dinners and dances of Austen's work.  I would not have previously said the forced courtesy of 19th century discourse is what I want to spend my free time reading but I'm loving it.  I'm sure the fact that it is about a magician, not matter how dull he may be, helps the matter.  And there is a humor to the interactions, a satire of the times that Clarke subtly employs.  Here's an excerpt that gives a good indication of the general tone and language<br /><blockquote>\"You are a magician, sir?\" said Mrs Wintertowne.  \"I am sorry to hear it.  It is a profession I have a particular dislike to.\"  She looked keenly at him as she said so, as though her disapproval might in itself be enough to make him renounce magic instantly and take up some other occupation.\" (88)</blockquote>I suppose Clarke's humor also reminds me of Dickens.  There's a smirking sarcasm to it that feels more like Dickens, although that could be because I'm also reading A Christmas Carole on my iPod Touch to see if I can get used to reading on there or if I should give in and get an e-reader.  <br /><br />I will most likely have a few entries on other books while I get through this one.  I have a bit of reading ADD and as it is I'm supposed to be reading What's My Name, Fool? for my book club.  It's really more of a drink-wine-and-catch-up club but we at least pick out a book for everyone to read so I'll try to get to this one as well.  It gives me a chance to read books I wouldn't have picked up on my own.<br /><br />Title quote page 4<br /><br />Clarke, Susanna.  Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell.

I have 3 favorite authors, at the moment anyway.<br /><br />Bill Bryson: A friend of mine (the same one that recommended Kitchen Confidential and Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell) lent me Bryson's book Made in America: A Brief History of the English Language in the United States and I have been hooked since.  I'm pretty sure he could write about paint drying and it would be funny.  He mostly writes travel books but he has a few language books, a memoir and even a science book.  I constantly re-read his work.  It's my go to book when I'm in the mood to laugh.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde: Another author I was introduced to do via a lent book.  It's my favorite way to learn about new works.  Anyway, his works are generally a mix of satire, dark humor, fantasy, lots of literary allusions and overall hilarious.  One of the first books I re-read for this blog is <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/youre-upsetting-worms-theyre-starting\">The Eyre Affair</a> the first book in the Thursday Next series, which I'm pretty sure I've read at least 5 times.  I anxiously await his latest work Shades of Grey to come out in paperback.<br /><br />Christopher Moore: This is a relatively new favorite author, for me anyway.  A co-worker had been bugging me to read Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal for months before I finally got around to it and I don't know what I was waiting for.  I loved that book.  I've since read 6 of his other works and have had to hold myself back from buying more each time I go to the bookstore.  I'm taking a little break to read someone else's work, at least for a little while.  I wrote a couple entries about his book <a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/you-cant-just-go-around-breaking\">Coyote Blue</a> for this blog.<br /><br />One other thing I love about these authors is they all reference Shakespeare and I love Shakespeare.  Bryson wrote a biography on him, Shakespeare: The World as Stage.  Fforde references Shakespeare in at least some small way in all of his books I've read so far and Hamlet is even a character in Something Rotten (see, there's one of those references).  And Moore retells the story of King Lear from the point of view of the Fool in his book Fool.  Fool is a close second to Lamb as my favorite Moore book. <br /><br />If you are looking for a book, I recommend anything by the author's above.  I'm yet to be let down.","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:56+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:56+00:00","published_at":"2010-07-09T17:37:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb05dde22641900065e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Jasper Fforde","slug":"jasper-fforde","url":"/articles/tags/jasper-fforde"},{"value":"bill bryson","slug":"bill-bryson","url":"/articles/tags/bill-bryson"},{"value":"christopher moore","slug":"christopher-moore","url":"/articles/tags/christopher-moore"},{"value":"Book Blogger Hop","slug":"book-blogger-hop","url":"/articles/tags/book-blogger-hop"}]}]},{"id":"53224eb05dde2223b60001aa","title":"A Heavy Tome","slug":"a-heavy-tome","url":"/articles/a-heavy-tome","body":"I just started the book Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke and it is most literally a heavy tome at 3.6lbs.  This didn't seem like too much when I picked it up at the store, but trying to hold it in one hand while grabbing onto a subway pole with the other I felt every ounce of that weight.  I gazed jealously at a few fellow riders who toted their e-readers.  For awhile I wasn't sure they were for me, but the more I read about them the more I want one.  Now I can't decide between a dedicated e-reader and a multi-function device.  OK, the Kindle and the iPad.  Later versions of the iPad anyway, after they fix a lot of the current limitations and the price comes down.<br /><br />I'd like a chance to play around with the Kindle.  I've played with the iPad a bunch of times.  The boyfriend is a big Mac fan so when I get dragged to the Apple story I generally find an open iPad and continue reading Super Freakonomics.  I'm up to chapter 1.  I saw a Kindle at a Target a few weeks ago but it was a display, non-working option.  All I could tell from it was the weight which is important but didn't really give me a good idea of actually reading on it.  So Amazon execs that are clearly avid follows of my blog, take note! If you let me play with your toy I'm more likely to buy my own.<br /><br />Of course the idea of an e-reader makes me a little sad because I picture empty bookshelves.  Sure an e-reader would make packing for vacations much easier and moving would be less of a pain. (Important note: do not split up a few books into all of your boxes to spread out the weight.  Instead of having to put up with a couple very heavy box, every box is heavy. Not only am I now missing some books that are probably still in random boxes in the storage unit under some junk but you get no weight break.)  In general I like my bookshelves.  They're one of the most prominent features of the living room and I like staring at them as I pick what to read next. I'm not much of a decorator so they do a lot of that work for me.  I have a feeling even if I got an e-reader I'd still buy the actual books. It'd be fantastic if you could get both the actual and e-copies of the books in some bundled discount.  Man, I am full of great ideas tonight.<br /><br />So what do you think: dedicated e-reader (Kindle), multi-function device (iPad) or just suck-it-up-and-deal-with-the-weight actual book?<br /><br />Update! Thanks to everyone for their comments!  I've decided to try out a couple e-reader apps on my iPod Touch before actually buying anything.  I have both the Kindle and iBooks app so I'll be reading A Christmas Carol on the Kindle app and The Hound of the Baskervilles on iBookes (hooray for free ebooks).

It reminded me of my senior  seminar class (Gender, Sex and the Rhetoric of Science) as well as the  definition of tragedy my Shakespeare's Tragedies professor used: \"A  dream of innocence, realized by a fact of guilt, that acquiesces  therein.\"  You're missed, professor Howlett. <br /><br />I finished up I Was Told There'd Be Cake and it was hilarious.  I had to hold back from laughing out loud on the T.  Although perhaps I shouldn't hold that laughter back; I might get more space on the train as people slowly back away from the crazy laughing lady.  Of course with my luck this would just encourage a chatty stranger to start up a conversation and then I'd have a new T buddy who, with my luck, would have the same schedule as me and I'd never get any commute-reading done again.  I'm so anti-social during rush hour.<br /><br />Right, the book.  At first the stories were a little hit or miss.  None were bad, but some just could not hold my attention.  And the more I read the more I realized that the stories I liked were the ones I could relate to.  I don't think I necessarily need to be able to directly relate a story in order to enjoy it but I was afraid maybe that was the case.  I scanned my shelf to see if this has always been the case.  I suppose it makes sense to see yourself in the story, to see something in the story that you've experienced.  But the more I looked at the other books on the shelf, especially the works of fiction, the more I realized that while there are certain elements of the human experience I can relate to, the stories themselves are foreign.  That's why they're so interesting.<br /><br />I tried to figure out what is different about IWTTBC.  After mulling it over for awhile, I realized it's the tone and style of the book.  It feels conversational, like you're sharing stories with a friend.  And when you listen to someone else's story, you end up thinking up your own story you'll tell as soon as they finish.  Granted Crosley is a better storyteller than I am and I enjoy listening to her stories without spending the whole time reading it waiting for her to hurry up and finish so I can tell my own (in my head) way-better story.  <br /><br />Of course this is just my personal experience with the book and I know this will be something I pick up when I want to read a quick essay or two.  Do you find yourself being drawn to books that feel like a conversation?  <br /><br />Title quote from page 183","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:57+00:00","published_at":"2010-07-08T00:43:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb15dde22fdcf000588","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"I Was Told There'd Be Cake","slug":"i-was-told-thered-be-cake","url":"/articles/tags/i-was-told-thered-be-cake"},{"value":"Sloane Crosley","slug":"sloane-crosley","url":"/articles/tags/sloane-crosley"}]}]},{"id":"53224eb15dde22fdcf000589","title":"As most New Yorkers have done, I have given serious and generous thought to the state of my apartment should I get killed during the day","slug":"as-most-new-yorkers-have-done-i-have-given-serious-and-generous-thought-to-the-state-of-my-apartment-should-i-get-killed-during-the-day","url":"/articles/as-most-new-yorkers-have-done-i-have-given-serious-and-generous-thought-to-the-state-of-my-apartment-should-i-get-killed-during-the-day","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/...There%27d+Be+Cake+cover.jpg\" />The quote I used in the title is the first sentence of the first essay \"The Pony Problem\" from the book I Was Told There'd Be Cake by Sloane Crosley and it was this opening that drew me into the book.  It's what got me to buy the book in the first place.  I had just intended to pick up one new book and I had already found it on one of the bargain tables (win!).  But the other person I had come to the Booksmith with had disappeared so while I wandered around trying to find him I ended up in the Essay section of the store and I saw this book.  I was already getting some strange looks from people who saw me repeatedly wandering up and down aisles without actually looking at the shelves, so to keep from looking suspicious I thought I should stand in one place for awhile and actually look at a book.  So really, I came across this as a tactic to make sure no one thought I was casing the place.  This is one of the reasons I love bookstores; I tend to come across books in the oddest of circumstances.  <br /><br />I read the first few essays and so far my favorite is \"The Good People of This Dimension\".  It's probably because out of the stories I've read so far I relate the most to this one.  I don't have a collection of objects from exes (\"The Pony Problem\"), I'm not Jewish and have never gone to a Christian summer camp (\"Christmas in July\"), and I've never had a boss as abusive as Sloane (\"The Ursula Cookie\").  That's not to say I have to relate to a story to enjoy it, but it's certainly easier to commiserate than compare and having shared a number of homes with a number of people, commiserating is what you do when you're talking about apartment living.    <br /><br />I've never had roommates or shared a building with other tenants who removed the hinges on the door in order to get in because they didn't want to touch the doorknob or tried to dig their way to China.  Perhaps you need to live in NYC to get that level of crazy.  I can certainly relate to the noise complaints. In the essay the restaurant downstairs decides to add a back dining patio and the construction noise each morning becomes a lot to deal with. The kids in one of my old neighborhoods had an affinity for fireworks that didn't limit itself to the 4th of July.  Perhaps they were just more patriotic than I am.  I never made it to the point Sloane did, of actually calling in a formal complaint but I'm sure I will become the crotchety neighbor at some point.  So far the closest I've come is yelling into the vents how crazy it is that you can hear conversations going on in the other apartments after my neighbor woke me up during an argument with his girlfriend at 2am again.  Passive-aggressive I know, but I knew too much about his clearly failing relationship and it seems he thought so too; after this move he made sure to have his arguments at a lower volume.  Or during the work day.  And then he made the ultimate kind gesture and moved out.  <br /><br />It's not just the shared experience I enjoyed about this story, but the voice that comes through.  The line, \"The first floor is really the second floor, which always struck me as very European until I moved in and had to climb an extra flight of stairs each day,\" (60) made me literally laugh out loud.  Probably because I feel the same way, especially when climbing the stairs to my friend's 4th-floor-but-actually-5th-floor walk-up apartment.  It's a mean trick to play on people.  <br /><br />I think there's something to her writing that feels like someone  sharing her personal stories with you so you want to share something  back.  But clearly I'm sharing something here on my blog instead of  actually with her.<br /><br />By the way, happy 4th of July to my fellow American readers!<br /><br />Title quote from page 1<br /><br />Crosley, Sloane.

I suppose that means the story got to me, which is always a good thing with any work, even if I wasn't happy with the emotions. Please accompany me on this little memory lane trip.<br /><br />It's the night before we're supposed to have all of part one read for class and, surprise! surprise!, I'd procrastinated.  I know, it's a shocker.  But I figured it's only 60 pages I need to have read.  Even my high school self knew that wasn't a huge task.  I figured I'd run through those pages and still get my nightly TV watching in.  I'm sure it was something very high brow, like The Real World.  I don't remember any point while reading that I too consciously thought about what I was reading.  It was more of a hypnotic experience.  What I do remember is as soon as I finished I looked at the clock and part of me thought \"Great!  Just in time to catch the show.\"  But then a louder part of my brain asked \"What's the point?\"  And then no part of my brain could come up with an answer so I turned my lights off and went to sleep.  When I later described this to people I remember feeling like all the color had just been drained away. <br /><br />The next morning I woke up and luckily the existentialism had lost it's depressing hold over me.  The depressing voice was no longer asking \"What's the point?\"  Instead the part of my mind that wanted to watch TV the night before yelled \"What the hell??  You just went to sleep?! Why'd you do that?  You wanted to watch that show!  You had been looking forward to it.  Nice move.\"  (I'm not particularly nice to myself when I think I've done something dumb.  It happens a lot.)  When I had to finish the second half of the book, I was on my guard.  I made sure to tell the book not to try anything funny, because I'm onto you.  Can't fool me a second time.  (Yes, I talk to books as well as other inanimate objects.  Don't worry though, nothing's started talking back.)  <br /><br />So with that history in mind, onto the book!","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:57+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:57+00:00","published_at":"2010-07-04T16:38:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb15dde223867000333","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Albert Camus","slug":"albert-camus","url":"/articles/tags/albert-camus"},{"value":"The Stranger","slug":"the-stranger","url":"/articles/tags/the-stranger"}]}]},{"id":"53224eb25dde22641900065f","title":"Book Blogger Hop I","slug":"book-blogger-hop-i","url":"/articles/book-blogger-hop-i","body":"I've seen a number of other blogs I enjoy taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.crazy-for-books.com/2010/07/book-blogger-hop-july-2-5-2010.html\">Book Blogger Hop</a> and thought I would give it a try.

I like this story while I'm reading it, but as soon as I read the last sentence I'm done.  Out of sight, out of mind as it were.  But I made note of this line while reading the story this time and even though the rest of this entry will be about the story \"1408\" I wanted to include that line.  <br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/1408poster.jpg\" />First I want to get it out of the way that I love this story.  It is certainly my favorite of this collection and absolutely in my top 5 favorite short stories.  When I got to the last sentence of this tale, it certainly didn't leave me like the deja vu story did.  As a matter of fact as soon as I read that last sentence I exhaled (I didn't realize I had been holding my breath) and then I immediately went back to the beginning to do it again.  The emotion kind of reminded me of a roller coaster: there's a lot of build up as you climb that first hill, you're grasping tight and screaming as you go around the loops and corkscrews and then when you pull back into the station there's relief and you just want to hop back in line and do it again.  That's how I feel about roller coasters anyway and it's how I see this story.<br /><br />\"1408\" is King's \"story about the Ghostly Room At The Inn\" (457) and I can say this is the only story that really scares me.  The other stories here might interest me or revolt me but this is really the only one that gets under my skin.  I think this is because of that first hill, the build up in Olin's office.  Mike Enslin wants to stay in the hotel's haunted room for his book and Olin has been trying to prevent this and this meeting at the beginning of the story is his last attempt to talk Mike out of his quest.  But the build up is subtle.  You know King is setting you up for the horror to come, but the foreshadowing doesn't beat you over the head. <br /><br />At one point during this intro Mike pulls out his mini-recorder but soon this move has turned on him.  \"Usually [the mini-recorder's] little red eye seemed to be watching the other guy, daring him to say the wrong thing.  This evening it seemed to be looking at Mike himself.\" (466).  This is the first of many times in this story that simple electronics become this evil presence, but on the first reading I didn't consciously fear the mini-recorder.  I just saw this as the first of many things not going the way Mike had intended, but the fact that the mini-recorder is one of the initial sources as discomfort sets you up for that discomfort later in the room.<br /><br />The build up is my favorite part of the book and it contributes to the fear and unease I feel when Mike actually makes it up to the haunted room.  But the fear comes from Mike's time in the room.  I think this is because the horrors mostly stay on the peripherals.  There's something not quite right you just catch out of the corner of your eye and slowly it builds and it's a gradual build up.  Like a frog in a pot of boiling water, you don't notice how everything is going wrong until it's too late to turn back.<br /><br />King mentions in the intro to this story there is an audio recording of this in the compilation Blood and Smoke.  I'd love to hear this.  I think I'll avoid the movie because I'm afraid not only will it not live up to what I hope it will be (and really, I don't see how it could, regardless of how well it's made) and I don't want the movie to taint how I feel about the story.  There's no moral reason for not wanting to see the movie; I just want the story to keep scaring me.<br /><br />Next up on the reading queue: I Was Told There Would Be Cake by Sloane Crosley<br /><br />Title quote from page 455<br /><br /><span>King,   Stephen.  \u201c1408\u201d.

By planning on I mean I haven't come up with them just yet.  I just finished the stories \"Everything's Eventual\" and \"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\" and I'm more than half way through \"The Road Virus Heads North\".  I'm surprised the book is taking me as long as it is, considering it's not much longer than the other books I've recently read and I've read it before.  You'd think this would go faster.  I had planned on writing an entry today, but I ended up going out for dinner, frozen yogurt and books instead.<br /><br />I'm excited about my new books.  New books always excite me.  I like re-reading old favorites too, but any of these books could be a new favorite.  There's so much potential. <br /><br />Anyway, I picked up I Was Told There'd Be Cake by Sloane Crosley and Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell  by Susanna Clarke.  I skimmed a couple of the essays by Crosley and there's a good chance I'll read this before I actually finish Everything's Eventual.  The little bit I read cracked me up.  I've had a few friends with trusted book tastes read and recommend Strange &amp; Norrell and it was on sale so I decided to pick it up. <br /><br />I also want to make mention of the awesome local bookstore we have in town, The Brookline Booksmith.  I do shop at the big boxes like Borders and Barnes &amp; Nobel but I try to support the local places and the Booksmith is fantastic.  Great new selection, lots of used books, and fun events like Christopher Moore showing up. It's the type of place I would like to run.  Now if only they would get some of Jasper Fforde's stuff in.

I've been traveling for work so my normal reading schedule has been thrown, but I'm back now so hopefully things will move a bit quicker.  I also think the fact that this is a book of short stories makes the process longer.  I feel like I can't jump right from one story into the next; I need some time to take in what I just read, some time to reflect.  Especially with a story I liked.  If a story really draws you in you become invested in the characters.  It's hard to finish reading their journey and then just move right into a whole new world.  Do you find yourself needing some reflection time after finishing a story, be it a short story or a grand epic?<br /><br />So far I've read through the stories \"Autopsy Room Four\", \"<a href=\"http://whatredread.com/2010/nine-year-old-boy-i-was-had-done\">The Man in the Black Suit</a>\", \"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\", \"The Death of Jack Hamilton\", \"In the Deathroom\" and \"The Little Sisters of Eluria\".  My favorite story is near the end of the book, but right now I'll focus on the story \"In the Deathroom\".<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites of the book, but other than the one I've already written about it's the one I like the best out of the one's I listed above.  Especially as I just finished \"The Little Sisters of Eluria\" this afternoon, \"the Deathroom\" is a realistic horror tale.  At least as real as my extremely skewed-by-pop-culture view of South American dictatorship allows.  Maybe because I've heard/read/watched awful stories about unspeakable crimes happening in dictatorships all over that just the general premise of the story scares me.  Even the more ridiculous parts get this extra oomph of realism, simply because in my mind I could imagine this actually happening.  I even found myself playing along with the main character Fletcher as he considered his options Maybe They Will, such as \"maybe they really will let [him] go\" (144) and Even If I Do, such as even if he gets away where will he go.  During the \"conversation\" as Escobar puts it, I found myself thinking what would I do?  Would I lie?  Play dumb?  Try to play it strong?  Break down and tell everything I knew?  I mean, realistically I know what I would do.  I'd get killed.  It's pretty much that simple.  I found myself going the play dumb route and then getting myself killed.  It would be an even shorter story if I was the main character is the bottom line.  The game is certainly difficult to play after I already knew the outcome of the story, but I know the first time I was reading it I disagreed with everything he did but then realized he was right, or at least mostly right, and I was wrong.<br /><br /><span>King,  Stephen.  \u201cIn the Deathroom\u201d.

Get a deck of cards, assign the stories a value Ace through King, shuffle and deal.  Whatever order they come out, that's the order they show up in.

My iPod Shuffle gives me a similar experience, jumping around from Flight of the Conchords to Frank Sinatra to Buck-O-Nine to Rx Bandits to David Bowie to Bob Dylan.

I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll focus on the stories I love, and perhaps make a quick mention of the other stories I like.  Or maybe I\u2019ll make one entry dedicated to quick synopsis of the stories I like.  Who knows?  I\u2019ll just play it by ear.

It\u2019s not my absolute favorite but I\u2019ll get to that one in a later entry.  In his description at the end of the story King describes this tale as \u201ca rather humdrum folktale told in pedestrian language\u201d (68). I don\u2019t know that it feels exactly like a folktale, with the exception of the time period, nor does the language feel pedestrian; modern sure.  It certainly doesn\u2019t read like a Hawthorne piece, which King used as inspiration for this story and in my mind this is certainly not a criticism of the piece.  I always like the idea of early American Lit, the idea of Hawthorne, but when I actually read it I find myself so distracted by the language I have trouble fully appreciating the story.  Here I can completely focus on the tale without the distraction.  I\u2019m sure this just means I\u2019m not working hard enough at Hawthorne, but I\u2019ve spent plenty of time getting used to Elizabethan English that I don\u2019t feel too much need to work too hard on another dead dialect.  <o:p></o:p></span><br /><span>Back to the story!  Sorry, I easily get off topic.  I think it\u2019s the innocence of the story that I enjoy so much.  It\u2019s early 1900\u2019s and the main character, Gary, who meets the man in the black suit, is only 9 years old at the time of the story though he is telling the story as an old man.  Had Gary been older, even if only by a couple years, the story would have progressed much differently and certainly much more violently.  Who but a child would offer the Devil a freshly caught fish when the Devil tells you he\u2019s hungry?  Perhaps someone older than a child wouldn\u2019t have met a man in black.  He wouldn\u2019t have believed and accepted the Devil would just walk out of the forest and start talking to him.  It\u2019s true that Gary is telling the story as an old man who clearly still believes in the Devil but this is only because as a youngster he was confronted with this reality.  The horror of the story really comes from this belief Gary carries with him through old age.  He writes his story down to try to release himself from these memories but he fears he\u2019ll meet the Devil again when he shuffles off this mortal coil.  There\u2019s a line at the end of the story, the line I used as the title that describes the fear succinctly.  \u201cThe nine-year-old boy I was had done nothing for which he might legitimately fear the devil either\u2026and yet the Devil came\u201d (67).  It\u2019s the fact that even living a good and innocent life cannot necessarily save you from the Devil.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><span>King, Stephen.  \u201cThe Man in the Black Suit\u201d.

And I have all of these books already that I'd want to be able to put on the e-reader without having to re-buy them.  I suppose they would just remain physical copies.  I think booksellers should come up with some sort of deal that lets  you buy both the physical copy of the book and the ecopy.  Maybe an  extra $3 or so for the ecopy.  I would certainly be up for that.<br /><br />I don't really have a logical reason for not buying an e-reader, yet I seem to keep making excuses. OK, I do have one logical reason for preferring physical books to ebooks: I don't want to keep staring at computer screens.  I spend essentially 8 hours a day on a computer at work, I spend longer than I probably should on my computer or watching TV or playing with my iPod Touch while at home so I would like to not add another electronic to that mix.  I finally made it to the eye doctor to complain about blurry vision when watching TV or driving at night and he said it is most likely due to all my screen-staring time.  I've never needed glasses before, and to be honest I hardly wear the ones I have now unless I'm driving at night or having trouble at the movies.  I do love what they look like though.  Sorry, I'm getting off track.   <br /><br />I think if/when I do give in and get an ereader I'll probably get the iPad.  I want to be clear that I think the iPad is ridiculous, especially the name.  Really, iPad?  Are there no females over at Apple that could have pointed out the problem with that name?  Anyway, iPad, a large, not-so-portable iPhone that doesn't make phone calls.  BUT if I was thinking of getting an e-reader, why not get an iPad?  Or really, why should I limit myself to a Kindle that primarily just lets me read books when I could get something that lets me do 100 other things as well as read books?  And you could get a Kindle app on the iPad.  Or BnN which ZDNet reviews prefers.  But I don't want the current iPad.  Not until they fix the limitations with the current iPad.  Perhaps a later edition, I'll rethink my stance.<br /><br />What do you think?  E-reader: yay or nay?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:59+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:34:59+00:00","published_at":"2010-06-19T01:06:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb35dde223867000337","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[]}]},{"id":"53224eb45dde2223b60001ae","title":"It's nice, sometimes, to know how low you can really go","slug":"its-nice-sometimes-to-know-how-low-you-can-really-go","url":"/articles/its-nice-sometimes-to-know-how-low-you-can-really-go","body":"There's a quote in the Afterward of <em>Kitchen Confidential</em> where Bourdain is looking back on his career and the highs and the lows of where he's been and where he is now that has always stuck out to me.

And if you don't like cursing you may want to skip this book altogether.<br /><br />\"Anytime I think 'This is beneath me!' or \"This is fucking humiliating!' I have only to think of lying to my Mom to get a few dollars for crack, or selling my books and records on Broadway, or working at that horrifying TV-themed restaurant to remember what real humiliation is.

I do most of my reading during my daily commute and the more I can forget I'm in a tin can sharing 1 square foot with 8 other people the better. My commute takes me right by Fenway Park so I dread any home game I'm not going to because it means twice the amount of people will be on the train, most of whom are oblivious to subway etiquette.  Today was one of those home games and I had to let 2 trains go by before I could finally squeeze myself onto one, so I was ready to forget where I was.  The cruelest part of a crowded train is when it's too crowded, there isn't even enough space for me to pull out a book, so we went a couple stops before enough people shifted around and I made myself over to a pocket of space where I could actually hold a book out in front of me, although the space behind me was still shared with 3 adults, 2 children and a large backpack.  But even the yelling of excited Red Sox fans and the bag hitting my arm at a steady rate I was able to block it all out and focus on the book, because the story pulled me in.<br /><br />I guess I'm saying a good book is the equivalent of me holding my hands  over my ears and going \"lalalalala\" to the rest of the world.<br /><br />I suppose this isn't the best judge of a book, but it's certainly something I keep in mind whenever I'm picking out a book from my shelf to re-read.  Today I was lucky enough to be starting the \"A Day in the Life\" chapter of Kitchen Confidential. This is my favorite chapter and Bourdain's writing is vivid enough that I can picture the crazy restaurant whirlwind when the closest I've come to seeing the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen is reruns of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.  Perhaps it's some measure of schadenfreude (and yes I sang the song from Avenue Q to spell that) that I like reading about the insanity of the kitchen to make my commute feel like a leisurely stroll. And just as I finished the chapter the train pulled into my stop.  Perfect timing.<br /><br />What are your escape books?","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:00+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:00+00:00","published_at":"2010-06-15T23:20:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb45dde22fdcf00058e","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Kitchen Confidential","slug":"kitchen-confidential","url":"/articles/tags/kitchen-confidential"},{"value":"escape","slug":"escape","url":"/articles/tags/escape"},{"value":"Anthony Bourdain","slug":"anthony-bourdain","url":"/articles/tags/anthony-bourdain"},{"value":"subway","slug":"subway","url":"/articles/tags/subway"}]}]},{"id":"53224eb45dde226419000663","title":"If you have any doubt which will dent -- the victim's head or your pan -- then throw that pan right in the trash.","slug":"if-you-have-any-doubt-which-will-dent-the-victims-head-or-your-pan-then-throw-that-pan-right-in-the-trash","url":"/articles/if-you-have-any-doubt-which-will-dent-the-victims-head-or-your-pan-then-throw-that-pan-right-in-the-trash","body":"<img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Kitchen+Confidential+cover.jpg\" />","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:01+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:01+00:00","published_at":"2010-06-13T16:06:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224eb45dde226419000664","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"Kitchen Confidential","slug":"kitchen-confidential","url":"/articles/tags/kitchen-confidential"},{"value":"Anthony Bourdain","slug":"anthony-bourdain","url":"/articles/tags/anthony-bourdain"}]}]},{"id":"53224eb55dde2223b60001b0","title":"\"You can't just go around breaking people's legs like some Mafioso fairy godmother\"","slug":"you-cant-just-go-around-breaking-peoples-legs-like-some-mafioso-fairy-godmother","url":"/articles/you-cant-just-go-around-breaking-peoples-legs-like-some-mafioso-fairy-godmother","body":"First of all, apologies for taking so long to get this update out.  After getting back from vacation it took more time than expected to get back into the swing of things.  And a friend won a free happy hour, so there's that. <br /><br />My copy of Coyote Blue has some questions in the back meant for a reading group to discuss and I figured I would use one of their jumping off points.  A quick note that this will go over events that happen all through the book so there will be spoilers. <br /><br />Discuss morality in the course of the book.  After the Coyote has disrupted Sam's life, he goes about \"making things right\" in various ways -- for instance, by getting Sam's home back by breaking Josh Spagnola's legs and helping to blackmail Aaron Aaron.  Is he really doing right to Sam by doing wrong to others? (114)<br /><br />The basic trickster archetype, as described by Wikipedia where I obviously do most of my last minute research, \"plays tricks or otherwise disobeys normal rules and conventional behavior\" and the coyote is especially seen as a trickster in Native American culture.  If Coyote had spent more of his time acting more like Cinderella's fairy godmother he wouldn't have been a trickster and honestly the story would have been far less interesting.  Of course breaking the security guard Spagnola's legs to get Sam back into his condo complex isn't moral behavior.  He did it to help Sam, but this is also not a case of naive good intentions.  In this broken leg case, Coyote very deliberately went through Sam's Rolodex to make sure Lonnie got Josh's address and he knew Lonnie would attach Josh in some way.  He operates in an \"ends justify the means\" way, as long as those means entertain him and this tone permeates the rest of the book.  You end up cheering on Coyote and his bad behavior and, morally reprehensible or not, you want him to help out Sam by stealing his car and selling to get money to play craps.  Alright, so I don't really know how that helped Sam but it was funny.<br /><br />Coyote Blue wasn't my favorite of the Moore books I've read, but I would absolutely recommend. <br /><br />Title quote from page 145<br /><br />Moore, Christopher,  Coyote Blue.

So far for this blog this is the first book I'm reading for the first time while blogging about it.  All of the others have been re-reads and to be honest, the next few after this will be re-reads as well.<br /><br />As with all of the other Moore books I've read, this one has pulled me in right away.  I find myself thinking \"I'll just read to the end of this chapter and then I'll put it down\" for 3 or 4 chapters before I finally listen to myself.  It has Moore's typical wit and humor and I found myself laughing aloud while reading, which was a bit awkward as I was in public.  Luckily my boyfriend was reading another Moore book at the time, Lamb, so he was laughing just as much.  If I'm going to look crazy, at least I have another lunatic with me.<br /><br />Early in the book Sam, the salesmen without an identity of his own, going through his morning routine and \"congratulating himself for single-handedly saving the planet just by getting up in the morning\" (67).  His list of morning good deeds includes:<br /><br />- Washing his hair with shampoo never put in a bunny's eyes &amp; 10% of the profits go to saving the whales<br />-Lathered with shaving cream free of CFCs<br />-Ate fertile eggs laid by sexually satisfied chickens<br />-Ate muffins made with pesticide-free grain, so no eagle-egg shells were weakened<br />-Cooked in margarine free of tropical oils, thus preserving the rain forest<br />-Milk comes in a carton made of recycled paper and from a small family farm<br />-Coffee went to help educate the children of a poor peasant farmer named Juan Valdez<br /><br />Even with all the earth saving and good deeds he's completed before 10am, he hasn't set foot on unpaved ground in the last 2 years.  (67)<br /><br />Sam has been hiding his true identity as a Native American from the Crow tribe for the last 20 years and I like this exaggeration of how in touch he still is with the earth and keeping it safe and yet is so far removed from it he doesn't realize he's hardly seen anything natural in his trips from his office to his condo.  He's completely removed from who he was yet he doesn't, at this point, have any remorse for this. Until his spirit guide, Coyote Blue starts showing up.  As the trickster coyote he simultaneously helps Sam and causes trouble at every turn. Moore's humor leads you into a story that is much deeper than you may initially assume, and by the time you realize it, you're hooked.  <br /><br />I'll probably look at the trickster more in a different entry when I've read a little more of the book and maybe when I have some more time to write. <br /><br />Title quote from page 68<br /><br />Moore, Christopher,  Coyote Blue.

He begins by looking at IQ tests over multiple generations and notes that average IQ scores have gone up, especially in \"problem-solving and pattern-recognition skills\" measured by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Progressive_Matrices\">Raven Progress Matrices</a> test (148-149).  Johnson does not give evidence that this increase in IQ scores is definitely created by the change in pop culture, but does point out that the increase is measurable across culture and environment.  There is a bit of a leap of faith to believe that there is no other cause that could have created this score increase or that pop culture in conjunction with some other factor caused the score.<br /><br />Johnson touches on the profit in making TV shows and movies more complicated, citing increased DVD sales which reward repeated viewings.  He argues that before VCR, DVD, DVR and a host of other acronyms you pretty much got one shot at seeing a TV show, so if the show was too complicated and it was easy to miss small details you would lose your audience, which means a loss of profits.  Now that you can watch and rewatch shows and movies there is profitable motivation to make these layered and complex enough to warren multiple viewings.  If the show is too simple, there's no reason to see it multiple times which means there is no reason to buy it on DVD.<br /><br />Johnson mentions that neuroscience shows \"that the brain has dedicated systems that respond to -- and seek out --new challenges and experiences\" (181) and says this is why people seek out more complex forms of entertainment.  And while it is true that the amount of reading people do is on the decline, so are all forms of entertainment because there are so many different things for the average person to do now and there are still the same number of hours in a day.<br /><br />Can you think of any anecdotal evidence of pop culture improving the mind?  Or do you think pop culture is catering to the lowest common denominator?  <br /><br />Title quote from page 179<br /><br />Johnson, Steven.

The rest of part 1 of the book focuses on pop culture in the forms of movies, the internet and TV.  He makes compelling arguments in all three cases but I liked his TV section the best and since this is my blog I'm going to discuss that section.<br /><br />He splits the TV argument into 2 sections: traditional narrative TV shows with actors and a script and reality TV shows.  It's easier to make the argument that traditional narrative TV shows are becoming more complex.  He looks at theme of \"multithreaded\" stories, stories that follow multiple storylines and have multiple important characters such as The Sopranos, Lost, ER, and The West Wing.  It's not only the amount of threads a person has to keep straight while watching, the shows now lack the \"narrative handholding\" (74) shows used to feature.  TV shows force you to fill in the blanks and probe the show to understand the narrative, just as the video games force you to probe the worlds.  It takes more mental exercise to follow these complex stories than it does to follow a simpler show, such as Dragnet.<br /><br />It doesn't take too much to go along with Johnson in his argument that dramas such as these are becoming more complex but it's his argument that reality TV is also more complex than TV shows of previous generations.  It's hard to really imagine a way that reality TV can be cognitively good for anyone.  When people think of pandering to the lowest common denominator reality TV is at the forefront of that argument.  But Johnson manages to make a convincing argument that even TV shows like Joe Millionaire have a cognitive benefit that other game shows lack.  I don't want this entry to be me just rehashing the arguments he makes in the book, but the argument I found most compelling is the idea that reality TV shows focus the audience to analyze people on these TV shows: why do they make the alliances they do, what did that look mean, etc.  Reality TV shows exercise the audiences autism quotient, or the ability to \"read emotional cues, anticipating the inner thoughts and feelings of other people\" (98).  One of the most interesting arguments Johnson makes centers around the Nixon-Kennedy debates, \"where the guy with the best makeup always wins\" (100).  Much is made about this debate and the dumbing down of the nation, where appearance is more important that the substance of what people say, but Johnson argues that those watching the debate on TV had access to extra emotional information that wasn't available to those who were simply listening.<br /><br />\"TV viewers...thought Nixon's sweating and five-o'clock shadow made him look shifty and untrustworthy...What if it wasn't Nixon's lack of makeup that troubled the TV watchers?  After all, Nixon did turn out to be shifty and untrustworthy in the end.\" (103)<br /><br />So what do you think?  Is there some benefit to reality TV?  Are narrative TV shows getting more complex and engaging the audience more?<br /><br />Title quote from page 132<br /><br />Johnson, Steven.

I picked this as my next book because I figured I've read a couple fiction books and I should mix it up with a non-fiction one.  Originally I was going to re-read Kitchen Confidential but I've read that one a number of times and I've only read this one once before.  Don't worry, my next book will be completely new to me.  By the way, the title quote is from the intro, page xvi.<br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Everything+Bad...cover.jpg\" />  <br /><br />Steven describes the book as \"an old-fashioned work of persuasion\" (xv) to prove that today's pop culture is not a brain drain on the culture that every op-ed piece seems to suggest, but rather that there are actual cognitive benefits to TV and video games. <br /><br />His first section, and the section I've just finished reading, concerns video games, which is probably one of the most demonized forms of pop culture.  I will start this by saying I am not a gamer by any stretch of the imagination, though I did grow up with one in the form of my brother and thus have seen them in their natural habitat.  I can also say that my Brother the Gamer is far smarter than I am, so anecdotally I can see the brain drain is not affecting him.  I suppose this means I don't need to be persuaded but nonetheless, Johnson makes a compelling argument that video games have evolved from the days of Pong and PacMan to a system of complex tasks, learning through action or \"probing\" and delayed rewards.  He describes the \"mental labor\" it takes to complete the tasks \"telescoping because of the way the objectives next inside one another like a collapsed telescope\" and \"part of this skill lies in focusing on immediate problems while still maintaining a long-distance view\" (54) which Johnson argues is an important skill exercised by video games that is used in other aspects of life.  It's easy to judge video games by the same criteria books are judged by, but that misses the benefits video games do provide.  Video games won't replace Shakespeare, but then again neither will physics. <br /><br />What are your general thoughts?  Are the majority of video games mindless wastes of time?  Or is there something more to them?<br /><br />Johnson, Steven.  Everything Bad Is Good For You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter.

Thursday changes the ending to Jane Eyre by calling to Jane in Rochester's voice and thus leading Jane to return to the now burned down Thornfield and finish the narrative the way it is know in our world.  In an excerpt from Thursday's diaries she mentions that changing the ending of Jane Eyre violates \"[her] training...[and] everything that [she] had sworn to uphold\" but that she \"acted out of compassion, not duty, and sometimes that is no bad thing.\" (351) Obviously this works for the story.  Throughout the novel various characters talk about what a let down the \"real\" ending to Jane Eyre is so having Thursday change the ending is natural and it leads to some nice symmetry when Thursday's own ending is saved by a similar deus ex machina.  I wondered, are there stories I would want to change?<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind are Shakespeare's tragedies.  I think one of the many things that make Romeo &amp; Juliet, Hamlet and Othello so great is that even though I know from the beginning how the story will turn out, I always kind of hope something will happen to engineer a happy ending.  But if that were to happen, it wouldn't be the powerful story it is and I wouldn't enjoy it.  Same thing with Lamb by Christopher Moore.  You go into that book knowing how it's going to end, yet by the time I get to the ending I keep hoping things will turn out differently.  But I suppose my emotion at reading one of these tragedies is different than the dissatisfaction everyone felt for the \"original\" Jane Eyre ending.  I'm at a bit of a loss as to finding a book I enjoyed all of except for the ending.  I can think of books I would change, but it would mostly be to make the story itself not exist.  I can't say I'd be too upset if someone were to jump into American Psycho and kill off Bateman in the first couple chapters.<br /><br />Are there any books you would change if you could?   <br /><br />I was thinking I should review The Eyre Affair, but there seem to be plenty of places to find reviews so instead I'll just say I love this book and would recommend it to anyone I think will enjoy the literary humor.

The book worms \"had just digested a recent meal of prepositions and were happily farting out apostrophes and ampersands; the air was heav'y with th'em&amp;.\" (312)  The whole series is peppered with jokes like this; jokes that only work if you're reading the story.  Sure, I suppose you could have apostrophes and ampersands floating around the screen but how would you indicate that the characters' speech is affected by the worms punctuous gas? <br /><br />There are a lot of books that have been called unfilmable but this is the only series that I think actually fits this description.  I'm not sure why everyone made such a big deal about <span>The Watchmen</span> being unfilmable.  It's already set in a visual medium, the graphic novel, so it's part of the way there.  Maybe the special effects aren't currently quite at the point that they can seemlessly integrate without taking you out of the story, but SFX are always improving.  This series is the first one that I think the story would be severely hurt if it's told via some other medium.  But maybe someday, someone will prove me wrong.  I don't know if I would like the movies, at least not better than the books.<br /><br />A teacher once explained to me the reason books are better than their movie adaptations is that with the book you make all of the decisions.  You are an active participant in creating the worlds you see so you have, you could say, a vested interest in the novel.  I've certainly watched movies, <span>Pet Semetary</span> comes to mind, where all I could think was \"well that's not what Church looks like! What's Rachel doing?  She doesn't sound like that at all.\"  It took me out of the story for no reason other than the fact that I had already decided these details when I read the story and the movie didn't match.<br /><br />That doesn't mean the movie always falls short of the book.  I know I'm not in the majority with this, but I do not like <span>The Lord of the Rings</span> books.  I tried.  I tried because, much to my surprise, I loved the <span>Fellowship </span>movie.  I hadn't read the book before I saw the movie, so maybe that was my problem.  I read the first book after I saw the movie and fully expected to enjoy it.  And then  I didn't.  The setting was described in great detail but I couldn't keep the characters straight.  With the exception of Frodo, all of the fellowship members just blended together for me.  After making my way through the book I decided I liked the movies too much and saw the second movie before reading that book.  I was now familiar enough with the movie to know the characters and be able to keep them straight while reading.  I think it was this and not character development on the stories part that actually helped.  I didn't like the narrative structure but I plowed through.  I couldn't believe I would like a movie better than a book.  I only made it part of the way through the third book before I decided I had enough other books to read that punishing myself just to get through this one wasn't worth it.  Maybe I'll try again.  The books are still on my bookshelf.  But I think the decision has been made and I'll never be able to make <span>The Lord of the Rings</span> my own now that I've seen the movie.<br /><br />Are there any other books that can't be made into movies?  Are there any movies that surpassed the book?<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper. <span>The Eyre Affair</span>.

Bowden and Thursday are discussing the plot of <span>Jane Eyre</span> and how the \"original\" ending, with Jane going to India with St. John Rivers, is anticlimactic and how the story would have been much better if Jane and Rochester got married.  I don't necessarily believe that we try to make art perfect, at least not all art.  But that is the beauty of art, it can show any number of facets of life: perfect, realistic, grotesque, funny and sad.<br /><br />History is the story of what happened.  There can be different versions of that story, told from different point of views, but it's always what happened.  Literature is what happened, what we wish happened or could happen, what we fear did or could happen.   Books not only open up worlds we may not be able to visit but it let's us see the world from all different points of view, more than history could ever provide.  I think literature takes from all other areas of study, science, philosophy, history (as I may have already mentioned once or twice) but it really doesn't give too much back to those subjects, other than perhaps igniting an interest in these other fields.  Philosophical lessons, like those of Aesop, are told through fables and tales.  I've been speaking of literature specifically, but this extends to all forms of art, high and low.  The TV show <span>CSI</span> and similar shows sparked an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_effect#Influence_on_forensic_science_training_programs\">increased interest in forensic science</a> as well as creating the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15949089\">CSI Effect</a> where \"jurors hold unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence and  investigation techniques\".  The point is art affects the \"real world\" while at the same time shining light back on it.<br /><br />On a separate note, I wonder if this is just something I do or indicative of a larger theme, but when I referred to female characters I called them by their first name but when I talked about male characters I called them by their last name.

Having said that, here's a conversation I do really like, between Landen and Thursday:<br /><br />\"How was your first day?\" [Landen] asked.<br />\"Kidnappings, vampires, shot dead a suspect, lost a witness to a gunman, Goliath tried to have me killed, puncture on the car.  Usual shit.\"<br />\"A puncture? Really?\"<br />\"Not really.  I made that bit up.\"  (181)<br /><br />Maybe I'm just easy to amuse but that made me laugh out loud when I read it.<br /><br />Anyway, I had so much trouble trying to come up with something to write about last entry that I thought I'd cheat a bit and find some questions from some of those \"discussion questions for book clubs\" sites.  My mom's boyfriend'sg daughter read this book for her book club and recommended it to me, so checking some book club websites seemed to be a good idea.  I liked this question from the <a href=\"http://www.bookbrowse.com/reading_guides/detail/index.cfm?book_number=976\">BookBrowse site</a><br /><br />If you could choose Ms. Nakajima's ability to jump into novels,  Thursday's     father's ability to travel through time, or Acheron Hades' ability  to defy     mortality, which power would you choose to have and why?<br /><br />To start with, I wouldn't want the time travel ability.  I would probably screw up history by squishing a bug that is responsible for the Industrial Revolution or something equally ridiculous.  Or else I would be too scared I'd screw up something to ever use the ability.  There's a quote describing the \"schools of thought about the resilience of time.  The first is that time is highly volatile, with every small event altering the possible outcome of the earth's future.  The other view is that time is rigid, and no matter how hard you try, it will always spring back to a determined present.\" (11)  I am clearly on the \"volatile\" side of that argument.  I just can't help but think of Simpsons Treehouse of Horror V <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_Punishment#Time_and_Punishment\">\"Time and Punishment\"</a> where Homer goes back in time and keeps screwing up the future with tiny changes to the past.  I hardly trust myself to keep plants alive, so having all of the future in my hands is far too much responsibility for me.<br /><br />Next up is Acheron's ability to defy mortality.  This option is interesting.  He seems to be immortal, bullet's just bounce off him without hurting him, and he doesn't appear to age, as Thursday describes: \"I remembered him from all those years ago.  It didn't seem as though he had aged even one day\" (41).  It's important he isn't just immortal but he also has eternal youth or else he'll end up like the Greek myth character <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus\">Tithonus</a>, who had eternal life but turned in to a cricket when he got old because he didn't have eternal youth.  But the way Fforde sets up Hades it seems his ability to defy mortality comes from his character and his character is pure evil.  Hades describes the pure evil he embodies: \"The best reason for committing loathsome and detestable acts--and let's face it, I am considered something of an expert in this field--is purely for their own sake...True and baseless evil is as rare as the purest good--and we all know how rare <span>that</span> is\" (29).  I don't want to embody the \"true and baseless evil\" that makes up Hades, and I think that is the only way to really have his skills.<br /><br />So this leaves Ms. Nakajima's book jumping abilities.  And I think this would be fantastic.  On the one hand, I don't have to be evil in order to accomplish this and so long as I'm not jumping into an original manuscript, I don't have to worry too much about screwing things up for everyone.  You would have to be careful about which books you jump into.  Really, I'd love to jump into any of the Thursday Next or Nursery Crime (Fforde's other series) books.  You'd have to be careful which book you jump into.  I like a lot of horror/mystery/thriller books but that doesn't mean I want to be part of the action.  I definitely don't want to end up in <span>American Psycho.  <span><span><span></span></span></span></span>I'm sad enough I've read that book, let alone ending up one of Bateman's victims.  Jumping into Christopher Moore's <span>Fool</span> would also be fun.  It's Christopher Moore, who I love and Shakespeare.  Great combination!<br /><br />So yes to book jumping and no to time travel and evil immortality for me, but feel free to agree, disagree, agree but argue anyway, etc with me.<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper.

I realized I never write about the plot in these entries. And then I thought about a line in the play <span>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged</span> about covering the plot of a play in a footnote and how academic papers gloss over the whole point of a book, the story, for the minutiae. Then I tried writing out the plot a few dif ways but I was getting bored with it. My original and at this point current point for this blog is to act as a book club or classroom and discuss the books assuming they've been read already. This way I can talk about certain moments within the story, which I think are more interesting. I figure if people comment there can be a dialogue about whatever part I wrote about or some other part or what have you. So instead of me writing out a plot summary, here's one from Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eyre_Affair\"><span>The Eyre Affair</span> plot.</a><br /><br />I've been having trouble trying to decide what to write for this post.  As I mentioned I  tried a couple summaries but they just bored me.  I tried finding a line or 2 I liked, but I couldn't find any I really wanted to talk about.  I thought maybe I'd go over a character but it was hard for me to discuss them within this book and how far I've read, since I've read the whole series and know all the other times they pop up.  I've written a few paragraphs and I keep deleting them because they aren't going anywhere.  So I thought maybe I'd write about why I like this book so much and why I keep re-reading it.<br /><br />It's on one level a crime drama.  There's definitely a fascination with crime stories and most of the NYT Bestsellers fall into this category.  Thursday is a veteran of the Crimean War, she was a police officer and now she's with special operations and she's looking for the person that stole a priceless manuscript, <em>Martin Chuzzelwit</em>.<br /><br />On a different level, it's science fiction.  This takes place in an alternate universe where re-egineered dodos are common enough that they're no longer on the endangered species list, there's an entire SpecOps group to police the timeline (SO-12 the ChronoGuard), Crimean War has been going on for over one hundred years and the main villain, Acheron Hades, \"can lie in thought, deed, action and appearance\" (27).  Yet everyone is so blase about these things  that it seems more realistic.  Because the characters don't get caught up in how crazy things are, the reader doesn't.  Even Hades is treated in this type of manner.  He can make you turn your gun against yourself using what seems to be mind control, bullets flatten against him, he can project different appearances to disguise himself and while everyone knows he's unusual and dangerous, there is no questioning what he is or how he can do these things.  There are those who are skeptical of his abilities but those who know them to be true don't question how he does it.<br /><br />Then of course, the Prose Portal, which lets you enter any work of literature, and all of Mycroft's inventions are certainly at home in science fiction.  But perhaps because of the focus of the book is a world where art is so important that it's hard to categorize the book as science fiction.  It falls more comfortably, in my mind anyway, in Fantasy.  I think it's the traveling into books that puts it there for me.  There's no science that can be used to explain that (although I love the BookWorms).  If not fantasy than definitely surrealism.<br /><br />The book is also a satire, especially with the conglomerate Goliath.  As described in the intro to chapter 7:<br /><br />\"...No one could argue that we owe a debt of gratitude to the Goliath Corporation.  They helped us to rebuild after the Second War and it should not be forgotten.  Of late, however, it seems as though the Goliath Corporation is falling far short of its promises of fairness and altruism.  We are finding ourselves now in the unfortunate position of continuing to pay back a debt that has long since been paid -- with interest...\" (71)<br /><br />Goliath is a mega-corporation that has its hand in every piece of the government, including major interests in defense, which just like in our world, is big business.  Goliath mimics <em>1984</em>'s Big Brother but because people aren't cowering in fear of Goliath it almost seems more real and more likely a scenario than other more forceful distopias like <em>The Wanting Seed </em>or <em>Brave New World</em>.<br /><br />I guess what I like best about the book is the humor.  There are references to all types of literature, lots of Shakespeare (which I obviously love), ridiculous character names like Jack Schitt and just the general tone of the book makes me laugh.  A production of <em>Richard III</em> is treated like a showing of <em>Rocky Horror</em> with people yelling out lines and responses, and even getting in on the act.  It's hard to capture the tone of the book in a few lines, since most of the jokes are spread out and the humor doesn't translate unless you've been reading.  Here's an example of one of Mycroft's inventions:  \"In the early seventies he had developed an extraordinarily beautiful machine that did nothing more exciting than predict with staggering accuracy the number of pips in an unopened orange.\" (102)  And of course I like the quote I used in the title.<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper.

I'm good like that.<br />Anyway, I was saying I don't know what style the posts about <span>The Eyre Affair</span> will take, but so far rambling seems like the theme.  This is how I generally talk about things so I'm OK with this form.  For now anyway.  I change my mind a lot.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://whatredread.siteleaf.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/The+Eyre+Affair+cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474314527094168002\" border=\"0\" />Onto the book!  I've read the whole Thursday Next series a bunch of times (I repeat myself a lot too) but I'm going to try to keep my posts just about the part of the book I'm up to.  As I said I change my mind a lot (and that repetition thing) so this might change.  I'll at least try not to reference further in the book or the other books of the series.  But this is a long way of saying I love the character Thursday Next but I can only say this having read the series so far, not that the <span>The Eyre Affair</span> so far has lead me to this statement.  She is a strong, witty and independent female character without being masculinized or weird touchy feel-y I-Am-Woman-Hear-Me-Roar type character.  These characters are few and far between, especially in contemporary humorous books and even when such a character does exist she isn't the main character.  She's a supporting character and one that doesn't have to be fleshed out like a main character.<br /><br />OK, maybe this paragraph will actually mention something about the story.  We'll see.   <span>Brave New World</span> talked about how art is abandoned for stability.  The world created in <span>The Eyre Affair</span> goes in an entirely different way.  Thursday Next is an operative with the Literary Detectives, a whole department charged with dealing with crimes and law over literature.  Stability can suck it; I would way rather live in this world.  Thursday is listening to a news report and there is a story about a young surrealist that was stabbed to death by a \"gang adhering to a radical school of French impressionists\" (Fforde 10).  Obviously I don't actually want people to be stabbed for their artistic beliefs but I like the idea of someone getting so worked up over art.  It's like the news reports of people <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_spring#Premiere\">rioting </a>when they heard <span>The Rite of Spring</span> for the first time.  Rioting!  Over classical music!  I've been trying to think of something that could cause me to riot but I'm coming up blank.  Probably because whenever I try to come up with a specific example of anything I blank.<br /><br />I'm going to end this now with this quote, when Thursday is visited by a Baconian: \"If you expect me to believe that a lawyer wrote <span>A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, I must be dafter than I look.\" (38)<br /><br />Fforde, Jasper.  <span>The Eyre Affair</span>.

Not that I dislike buying books.  I very much like buying books.  I just dislike parting with money.<br /><br />I've read <em>The Eyre Affair</em> at least 4 times before, as well as the rest of the Thursday Next series.  And yet I've never read <em>Jane Eyre</em>.  I probably should.  Maybe I will at some point, but I always find something else I'd rather read.  It's the same with Austen.  I read <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> because my Brit Lit class made me but that's it.  I've read <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> twice, so I have the gist of <em>P&amp;P</em>.  But with zombies so obviously superior.  I did buy a real copy of <em>P&amp;</em>P but I've yet to start it.  And I have a feeling if I do start it I'll think \"I could be reading this same story, but with zombies and ninjas\" at which point I'll switch to <em>P&amp;P&amp;Z.</em>  I'll probably post about that book at some point.  I think it's made it into the circle of books I read multiple times.  Actually, I guess even if I never read it again it's already in that circle.

Thank you Boston for having such a slow subway system, I have almost 2 hours to just read while I try to pretend I'm not on the T.<br /><br />Back to the book.  As I briefly mentioned before, I have a very elaborate system involving me putting tiny pieces of ripped Post-Its on pages I wanted to talk about.  This worked well in school when I was marking the pages and writing in one sitting.  Now I've been marking it as I read, like all my teachers have always said to do, and now when I go back through my marked pages and I have no idea what I wanted to talk about.  So here's some rambling...<br /><br />I didn't like any of the main characters.  Lenina was probably the most sympathetic.  She wanted to break free of the life civilization had set before her, but she couldn't.  She needed something or someone to push her her out of the fog and it looked like John would be the person to do that for her.  But John's so utterly disgusted by civilization that her drives her back into the civilization she almost broke free from.  We don't hear from Lenina again until she briefly shows up in the last few pages. But again John chases her away with cries of \"Strumpet\" and \"Fitchew\" (257)and Lenina runs back into the arms of Henry and the civilized London.<br /><br />John is, if I may use a technical literary term, a pain in the ass.  His most reasonable point is when he is discussing civilization, happiness, stability and art with Mustapha Mond and Helmholtz.  Chapters 16 and 17 are my favorite of the entire book.  Mond gives compelling reasons why civilization is how it is and how stability and happiness outweigh drama, art and science.  \"You can't make tragedies without social instability,\" Mond explains but \"that's the price [you] pay for stability.  You've got to choose between happiness and...high art.\" (220)  While I may not believe the civilization they've created is the way we should be moving, I can at least see why they would make the choices they did. And it's only during this time, while discussing art and civilization with Mond that John the Savage is able to articulate his problems with civilization.  John whole belief structure is based on trials and hardships and his biggest complaint with civilization is \"[it's] too easy.\" (238)  They have removed all of the pain and suffering and emotional cost in existence that life doesn't mean anything anymore.<br /><br />In the Forward, Huxley mentions if he wrote this book with only 2 options for John the Savage: \"insanity on one hand [in the form of civilized London] and lunacy on the other [in the form of the primitive reservation].\" (<span>vii</span>)  I think the book is wanting for a middle ground, one that is hinted at in the island that Bernard and Helmholtz are sent to, but John is never given this option.  Mond won't let him go to the islands and he has to remain in London to continue the experiment, ultimately to his death.<br /><br />I began my rambling to talk about how much I disliked the characters and my initial plan was to talk about Bernard and how much he sucks. Yes, I tried to plan my rambling, but as usual my thoughts got away from me.  I like the direction I went, and I find I usually like where I end up, but I did use those lil Post-Its to mark a couple parts about how lame Bernard is, so here's one that particularly stuck out to me today:<br /><br />\"Bernard dashed to meet [the police].  He waved his arms; and it was action, he was doing something.  He shouted 'Help!' several times, more and more loudly so as to give himself the illusion of helping.\" (214)<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I quietly chuckled while reading this, eliciting some odd looks from fellow commuters.  I like the image of someone making these grand gestures to make it seem like they are doing something...anything.  \"[full] of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing\" (V.v.30-31) as Shakespeare so poetically put it.<br /><br />Huxley, Aldous.  <span>Brave New World</span>.

You might be saying (or would if anyone was reading this) \"But you're typing now, so clearly you have time.\"  Well smarty-pants, I'm at work right now so while I can be on the computer giving you this brief update, I can't really have the book out in front of me while I reference it for all those nuggest of gold I generally write.

I'll probably have a single post about <em>Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal</em> by Christopher Moore.  I'm in a book club with some friends, though it's much more of a drink wine and talk club.  Anyway, I recommended that book so that will be the topic of the next book club.

Not that I have anything better to get to, but I found as I was reading these next few chapters I found a couple lines I particularly liked and I'd like to just talk about those.  Plus I just hand wrote a bunch of tips for an unrelated project and I forgot how much writing things out with a pen sucks.  My hand is killing me and I wrote out what wouldn't even amount to a single typed page.  Anyway, onto the book<br /><br />Lenina shook her head.  \"Was and will make me ill,\" she quoted, \"I take a gramme and only am.\"<br />In the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of <span>soma</span>.  Five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present rosily blossomed.  (Huxley 104)<br /><br />I like the the repetition of the rhymes in the different mantras and especially the image of roots, fruits and blossoms.  I do believe it's good to live in the moment, to be the \"flower of the present\" and so many self-help books tout the importance of seizing the day, but as <span>BNW</span> points out completely avoiding the past and future, especially by chemical means is not really the way to carpe diem.  They repeat the \"beautiful and inspired saying of...Ford's: History is bunk,\" (34) and explain that is why they're \"taught no history,\" (35) but as the saying goes, \"those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it\".  How can you really move forward if you completely refuse to learn from past mistakes?<br /><br />The next part that stuck out to me happened when Lenina and Bernard are first at the reservation and they see an elderly man very slowly climbing down a ladder.  Neither have ever seen an old person before and when Lenina argues that they have old people where they come from, Bernard points out that they preserve people so they never look feeble.  He mentions; \"We give them a transfusion of young blood,\" (111).  I stopped at this point and wondered where are they getting this young blood.  There is no mention in the beginning of the book about them harvesting blood.  I don't remember if this comes up later in the novel, but this adds another sinister level to what they're doing.  They may deny the Epsilons basic human rights and dignity but there is no mention of people being used for their body fluids.<br /><br />There are a couple other lines on this page I really liked:<br /><br />\"In their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright,\" (111).  While the man's body might be feeble his eyes display a spark of life that seems out of place in the dulled lives of Lenina and Bernard.  His life filled with chaos has given him a life spark that life outside the reservation cannot match.<br /><br />\"Youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! the end.\" (111)  I can't really say which would be better: a life that ends at 60 years but you are youthful the entire time, or a life that goes on for 80+ years but you can feel your age.  Certainly prolonged youth with the conditions that come from the society in <span>BNW</span> would be undesirable, but in our current world I don't think I would be so opposed to it.

I'm not sure if I really don't remember the books from when I first read them, or if I see them in an entirely new light now.  Though to be honest, what I best remember from <span>Brave New World</span> is that it was the version of <span>1984</span> that didn't terrify me.  Drugs and sex are a less scary way to take over society than the thought police, though it should probably be the scarier option since you're less likely to notice you've lost control until it's gone.<br /><br />I haven't really decided on a format for this blog and I have a feeling it will vary depending on the day, the book, my mood.<br /><span></span><br />The book opens with a description of the way people are created in the future.  I'm not sure if this is a sign of how times have changed since the book was first published in 1932 or if it's just the way I'm reading it, but the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre seems like just that, a hatchery on a modern farm.  I'm not sure when commercial factory farms began mass producing products, such as eggs, at a rate that was considering the norm over small subsistence farms.<br /><br />More than the description of the hatchery and how it works, I was  interested in the description of the students.  \"A troop of newly  arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously,  rather abjectly, at the Director's heels.  Each of them carried a  notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately  scribbled,\" (Huxley 4)  They seem partly an example of the conditioning  that happens in the Centre but it's easy to see the students described  there as students in any college classroom.  They're mostly silent, ask  only a few questions and are promptly ridiculed for them.  Narratively  speaking they need to be quiet and have the Centre explained to them if  we, the reader, are to understand the world but students at this age  seem to be less a system of the new world's conditioning and more an  example of what behavior is expected of students at any point.<br /><br />Back to my earlier point, the idea is for the person hatchery and the chicken hatchery to be the same, but the idea that people are still being treated like living things rather than objects like their god Henry Ford created.  The adults of the novel repeat the mantra \"everyone belongs to every one else,\" (43) which allows them to objectify one another.  Lenina Crowne and Fanny Crowne , HenryFoster and the Assistant Predestinator repeat variations of \"having\" one another.  The objectification is then justified by the repetition of the mantra.  When everyone belongs to everyone else, everyone is treated as a belonging, and everyone views themselves as a belonging.  There is no family to give people a sense of belonging except for the family created by your caste.  An Alpha may not be a belonging for a Gamma, but they certainly are for other Alphas and there is no surface confusion or distress about this.<br /><br />Of course Lenina and Bernard begin to exhibit signs of internal distress about society.  Lenina's unease seems more sincere if less defined.  She blushes went Fanny accuses her of only sleeping with one person for the last few months and briefly questions societies arrangements.  \"No, there hasn't been any one else...And I jolly well don't see why there should have been,\" (40) though after hearing the mantra again Lenina relents: \"You're quite right, Fanny.  As usual.  I'll make the effort,\" (43).<br /><br />Bernard's indignation seems stronger when he's first introduced.  He overhears Henry and the AP discussing \"having\" Lenina and is disgusted.  He seems to have broken free of the conditioned beliefs he was taught to see people as people instead of objects.  The fact that he is described as \"a specialist on hypnopaedia\", (47) that he knows the secret of the brainwashing technique gives him the chance to rise above them.  Yet later he describes how he feels inferior to other Alphas and how he doesn't feel he's getting the respect from the other castes he thinks he deserves, the castes that are set by the hypnopaedia he is an expert on.  \"The mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one,\" (65).  Perhaps if Bernard didn't feel himself an outsider he wouldn't question his conditioning.  Lenina is far from an outsider, yet feels unease at society.  Her unease stems from actual problems she subconsciously perceives with society, but Bernard's has to do with his discomfort with his position. He envies men like Henry Foster, he doesn't find them contemptible.  If he was more comfortable he would have no problem agreeing with the conditioning and viewing people as belongings.<br /><br /><br />Huxley, Aldous.  <span>Brave New World</span>.

It was the reason I decided to major in English in college, even though I never really had a clue what I would do with the degree after graduating.  That date passed years ago and while my day to day work doesn't require me to read and analyze literature, I still read with the same enthusiasm as before.  I've considered, with much loving badgering from my mother,  going back to school for a Masters in English but so far I haven't found a career I would want that requires such a degree and paying tens of thousands of dollars for a very advanced book club seems like a waste of time and money.  Don't get me wrong, I would love to go back and if money wasn't a problem or I found a career that requires it I would be there.  But right now it seems like a lot to pay for a hobby.<br /><br />So, my plan for this blog is to write about the books as I'm reading them, random thoughts, questions and probably whatever else pops into my head.  I was originally going to start this writing about a book I'd never read before <span>Fluke or I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings<span> </span></span>by Christoper Moore. But then I finished it before I got around to starting this.  Then I started reading <span>Animal Farm</span> by George Orwell for the first time and thought I'd write about that.  But I finished that before I got my stuff together.  So the first book will be <span>Brave New World</span> by Aldous Huxley, which I last read in high school.  Ideally I wanted to start with a book I hadn't read before or even one that isn't quite as well known, but I've bought a lot of books recently and figured I should read (or re-read as it were) a couple books currently on my shelves.  I also have a habit of picking up other books so I may randomly have entries about different books or just certain scenes from a different book.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I'll read almost anything.  No really, I've read the entire <span>Twilight</span> series.  But my favorite authors are Jasper Fforde, Christopher Moore and Bill Bryson and I read lots of books about Shakespeare as well as the plays themselves.  My friends and I also meet for a book club every couple of months and while that club tends to be more focused on drinking wine than discussing books, it gives me a chance to read some books I wouldn't necessarily pick up on my own.<br /><br />The next entry will actually be about a book","visibility":"visible","created_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:10+00:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14T00:35:10+00:00","published_at":"2010-05-09T02:08:00+00:00","user_id":"529f51035dde22a026000228","site_id":"529f51115dde225c35000412","parent_id":"532205b15dde226419000339","meta":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":"53224ebe5dde22fdcf00059a","key":"Tags","slug":"tags","values":[{"value":"fforde","slug":"fforde","url":"/articles/tags/fforde"},{"value":"christopher moore","slug":"christopher-moore","url":"/articles/tags/christopher-moore"},{"value":"bryson","slug":"bryson","url":"/articles/tags/bryson"},{"value":"books","slug":"books","url":"/articles/tags/books"}]}]}]
